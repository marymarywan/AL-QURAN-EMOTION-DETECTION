   IN THE NAME OF GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  MOST MERCIFUL 
   PRAISE BE TO GOD  THE CHERISHER AND SUSTAINER OF THE WORLDS  
   MOST GRACIOUS  MOST MERCIFUL  
   MASTER OF THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 
   THEE DO WE WORSHIP  AND THINE AID WE SEEK 
   SHOW US THE STRAIGHT WAY 
   THE WAY OF THOSE ON WHOM THOU HAST BESTOWED THY GRACE  THOSE WHOSE  PORTION  IS NOT WRATH  AND WHO GO NOT ASTRAY 
   A L M 
   THIS IS THE BOOK  IN IT IS GUIDANCE SURE  WITHOUT DOUBT  TO THOSE WHO FEAR GOD 
   WHO BELIEVE IN THE UNSEEN ARE STEADFAST IN PRAYER AND SPEND OUT OF WHAT WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR THEM 
   AND WHO BELIEVE IN THE REVELATION SENT TO THEE AND SENT BEFORE THY TIME AND  IN THEIR HEARTS  HAVE THE ASSURANCE OF THE HEREAFTER 
   THEY ARE ON  TRUE  GUIDANCE FROM THEIR LORD AND IT IS THESE WHO WILL PROSPER 
   AS TO THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH IT IS THE SAME TO THEM WHETHER THOU WARN THEM OR DO NOT WARN THEM  THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE 
   GOD HATH SET A SEAL ON THEIR HEARTS AND ON THEIR HEARING AND ON THEIR EYES IS A VEIL  GREAT IS THE PENALTY THEY  INCUR  SECTION  
   OF THE PEOPLE THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY   WE BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY  BUT THEY DO NOT  REALLY  BELIEVE 
   FAIN WOULD THEY DECEIVE GOD AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE BUT THEY ONLY DECEIVE THEMSELVES AND REALIZE  IT  NOT 
   IN THEIR HEARTS IS A DISEASE  AND GOD HAS INCREASED THEIR DISEASE AND GRIEVOUS IS THE PENALTY THEY  INCUR  BECAUSE THEY ARE FALSE  TO THEMSELVES  
   WHEN IT IS SAID TO THEM   MAKE NOT MISCHIEF ON THE EARTH  THEY SAY   WHY WE ONLY WANT TO MAKE PEACE  
   OF A SURETY  THEY ARE THE ONES WHO MAKE MISCHIEF BUT THEY REALIZE  IT  NOT 
   WHEN IT IS SAID TO THEM   BELIEVE AS THE OTHERS BELIEVE  THEY SAY   SHALL WE BELIEVE AS THE FOOLS BELIEVE   NAY OF A SURETY THEY ARE THE FOOLS BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW 
   WHEN THEY MEET THOSE WHO BELIEVE THEY SAY   WE BELIEVE  BUT WHEN THEY ARE ALONE WITH THEIR EVIL ONES THEY SAY   WE ARE REALLY WITH YOU WE  WERE  ONLY JESTING  
   GOD WILL THROW BACK THEIR MOCKERY ON THEM AND GIVE THEM ROPE IN THEIR TRESPASSES  SO THEY WILL WANDER LIKE BLIND ONES  TO AND FRO  
   THESE ARE THEY WHO HAVE BARTERED GUIDANCE FOR ERROR  BUT THEIR TRAFFIC IS PROFITLESS AND THEY HAVE LOST TRUE DIRECTION 
   THEIR SIMILITUDE IS THAT OF A MAN WHO KINDLED A FIRE  WHEN IT LIGHTED ALL AROUND HIM GOD TOOK AWAY THEIR LIGHT AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS SO THEY COULD NOT SEE 
   DEAF DUMB AND BLIND THEY WILL NOT RETURN  TO THE PATH  
   OR  ANOTHER SIMILITUDE  IS THAT OF A RAIN LADEN CLOUD FROM THE SKY  IN IT ARE ZONES OF DARKNESS AND THUNDER AND LIGHTNING THEY PRESS THEIR FINGERS IN THEIR EARS TO KEEP OUT THE STUNNING THUNDER CLAP THE WHILE THEY ARE IN TERROR OF DEATH  BUT GOD IS EVER ROUND THE REJECTERS OF FAITH 
   THE LIGHTNING ALL BUT SNATCHES AWAY THEIR SIGHT  EVERY TIME THE LIGHT  HELPS  THEM THEY WALK THEREIN AND WHEN THE DARKNESS GROWS ON THEM THEY STAND STILL  AND IF GOD WILLED HE COULD TAKE AWAY THEIR FACULTY OF HEARING AND SEEING  FOR GOD HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS SECTION  
   O YE PEOPLE  ADORE YOUR GUARDIAN LORD WHO CREATED YOU AND THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE YOU THAT YE MAY HAVE THE CHANCE TO LEARN RIGHTEOUSNESS 
   WHO HAS MADE THE EARTH YOUR COUCH AND THE HEAVEN YOUR CANOPY  AND SENT DOWN RAIN FROM THE HEAVENS  AND BROUGHT FORTH THEREWITH FRUITS FOR YOUR SUSTENANCE  THEN SET NOT UP RIVALS UNTO GOD WHEN YE KNOW  THE TRUTH  
   AND IF YE ARE IN DOUBT AS TO WHAT WE HAVE REVEALED FROM TIME TO TIME TO OUR SERVANT THEN PRODUCE A SURAH LIKE THEREUNTO  AND CALL YOUR WITNESSES OR HELPERS  IF THERE ARE ANY  BESIDES GOD IF YOUR  DOUBTS  ARE TRUE 
   BUT IF YE CANNOT AND OF A SURETY YE CANNOT THEN FEAR THE FIRE WHOSE FUEL IS MEN AND STONES WHICH IS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH 
   BUT GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT THEIR PORTION IS GARDENS BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW  EVERY TIME THEY ARE FED WITH FRUITS THEREFROM THEY SAY   WHY THIS IS WHAT WE WERE FED WITH BEFORE  FOR THEY ARE GIVEN THINGS IN SIMILITUDE  AND THEY HAVE THEREIN COMPANIONS  PURE AND HOLY   AND THEY ABIDE THEREIN  FOR EVER  
   ALLAH DISDAINS NOT TO USE THE SIMILITUDE OF THINGS LOWEST AS WELL AS HIGHEST  THOSE WHO BELIEVE KNOW THAT IT IS TRUTH FROM THEIR LORD  BUT THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH SAY   WHAT MEANS GOD BY THIS SIMILITUDE   BY IT HE CAUSES MANY TO STRAY AND MANY HE LEADS INTO THE RIGHT PATH BUT HE CAUSES NOT TO STRAY EXCEPT THOSE WHO FORSAKE  THE PATH  
   THOSE WHO BREAK GOD S COVENANT AFTER IT IS RATIFIED AND WHO SUNDER WHAT GOD HAS ORDERED TO BE JOINED AND DO MISCHIEF ON EARTH  THESE CAUSE LOSS  ONLY  TO THEMSELVES 
   HOW CAN YE REJECT THE FAITH IN GOD  SEEING THAT YE WERE WITHOUT LIFE AND HE GAVE YOU LIFE  THEN WILL HE CAUSE YOU TO DIE AND WILL AGAIN BRING YOU TO LIFE  AND AGAIN TO HIM WILL YE RETURN 
   IT IS HE WHO HATH CREATED FOR YOU ALL THINGS THAT ARE ON EARTH  MOREOVER HIS DESIGN COMPREHENDED THE HEAVENS FOR HE GAVE ORDER AND PERFECTION TO THE SEVEN FIRMAMENTS  AND OF ALL THINGS HE HATH PERFECT KNOWLEDGE SECTION  
   BEHOLD THY LORD SAID TO THE ANGELS   I WILL CREATE A VICEGERENT ON EARTH   THEY SAID  WILT THOU PLACE THEREIN ONE WHO WILL MAKE MISCHIEF THEREIN AND SHED BLOOD  WHILST WE DO CELEBRATE THY PRAISES AND GLORIFY THY HOLY  NAME    HE SAID   I KNOW WHAT YE KNOW NOT  
   AND HE TAUGHT ADAM THE NATURE OF ALL THINGS  THEN HE PLACED THEM BEFORE THE ANGELS AND SAID   TELL ME THE NATURE OF THESE IF YE ARE RIGHT  
   THEY SAID   GLORY TO THEE OF KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE NONE SAVE THAT THOU HAST TAUGHT US  IN TRUTH IT IS THOU WHO ART PERFECT IN KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM  
   HE SAID   O ADAM  TELL THEM THEIR NATURES   WHEN HE HAD TOLD THEM GOD SAID   DID I NOT TELL YOU THAT I KNOW THE SECRETS OF HEAVEN AND EARTH AND I KNOW WHAT YE REVEAL AND WHAT YE CONCEAL  
   AND BEHOLD WE SAID TO THE ANGELS   BOW DOWN TO ADAM   AND THEY BOWED DOWN NOT SO IBLIS HE REFUSED AND WAS HAUGHTY HE WAS OF THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH 
   WE SAID   O ADAM  DWELL THOU AND THY WIFE IN THE GARDEN AND EAT OF THE BOUNTIFUL THINGS THEREIN AS  WHERE AND WHEN  YE WILL BUT APPROACH NOT THIS TREE OR YE RUN INTO HARM AND TRANSGRESSION  
   THEN DID SATAN MAKE THEM SLIP FROM THE  GARDEN  AND GET THEM OUT OF THE STATE  OF FELICITY  IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN  WE SAID   GET YE DOWN ALL  YE PEOPLE  WITH ENMITY BETWEEN YOURSELVES  ON EARTH WILL BE YOUR DWELLING PLACE AND YOUR MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD FOR A TIME  
   THEN LEARNT ADAM FROM HIS LORD WORDS OF INSPIRATION AND HIS LORD TURNED TOWARD HIM  FOR HE IS OFT RETURNING MOST MERCIFUL 
   WE SAID   GET YE DOWN ALL FROM HERE  AND IF AS IS SURE THERE COMES TO YOU GUIDANCE FROM ME  WHOSOEVER FOLLOWS MY GUIDANCE ON THEM SHALL BE NO FEAR NOR SHALL THEY GRIEVE 
    BUT THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH AND BELIE OUR SIGNS THEY SHALL BE COMPANIONS OF THE FIRE  THEY SHALL ABIDE THEREIN  SECTION  
   O CHILDREN OF ISRAEL  CALL TO MIND THE  SPECIAL  FAVOR WHICH I BESTOWED UPON YOU AND FULFIL YOUR COVENANT WITH ME AS I FULFIL MY COVENANT WITH YOU AND FEAR NONE BUT ME 
   AND BELIEVE IN WHAT I REVEAL CONFIRMING THE REVELATION WHICH IS WITH YOU AND BE NOT THE FIRST TO REJECT FAITH THEREIN NOR SELL MY SIGNS FOR A SMALL PRICE  AND FEAR ME AND ME ALONE 
   AND COVER NOT TRUTH WITH FALSEHOOD NOR CONCEAL THE TRUTH WHEN YE KNOW  WHAT IT IS  
   AND BE STEADFAST IN PRAYER  PRACTICE REGULAR CHARITY  AND BOW DOWN YOUR HEADS WITH THOSE WHO BOW DOWN  IN WORSHIP  
   DO YE ENJOIN RIGHT CONDUCT ON THE PEOPLE AND FORGET  TO PRACTICE IT  YOURSELVES AND YET YE STUDY THE SCRIPTURE  WILL YE NOT UNDERSTAND 
   NAY SEEK  GOD S  HELP WITH PATIENT PERSEVERANCE AND PRAYER  IT IS INDEED HARD EXCEPT TO THOSE WHO BRING A LOWLY SPIRIT 
   WHO BEAR IN MIND THE CERTAINTY THAT THEY ARE TO MEET THEIR LORD AND THAT THEY ARE TO RETURN TO HIM SECTION  
   O CHILDREN OF ISRAEL  CALL TO MIND THE  SPECIAL  FAVOR WHICH I BESTOWED UPON YOU AND THAT I PREFERRED YOU TO ALL OTHERS  FOR MY MESSAGE  
   THEN GUARD YOURSELVES AGAINST A DAY WHEN ONE SOUL SHALL NOT AVAIL ANOTHER NOR SHALL INTERCESSION BE ACCEPTED FOR HER NOR SHALL COMPENSATION BE TAKEN FROM HER NOR SHALL ANYONE BE HELPED  FROM OUTSIDE  
   AND REMEMBER WE DELIVERED YOU FROM THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH  THEY SET YOU HARD TASKS AND PUNISHMENTS SLAUGHTERED YOUR SONS AND LET YOUR WOMENFOLK LIVE  THEREIN WAS A TREMENDOUS TRIAL FROM YOUR LORD 
   AND REMEMBER WE DIVIDED THE SEA FOR YOU AND SAVED YOU AND DROWNED PHARAOH S PEOPLE WITHIN YOUR VERY SIGHT 
   AND REMEMBER WE APPOINTED FORTY NIGHTS FOR MOSES AND IN HIS ABSENCE YOU TOOK THE CALF  FOR WORSHIP  AND YE DID GRIEVOUS WRONG 
   EVEN THEN WE DID FORGIVE YOU  THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR YOU TO BE GRATEFUL 
   AND REMEMBER WE GAVE MOSES THE SCRIPTURE AND THE CRITERION  BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG  THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR YOU TO BE GUIDED ARIGHT 
   AND REMEMBER MOSES SAID TO HIS PEOPLE   O MY PEOPLE  YE HAVE INDEED WRONGED YOURSELVES BY YOUR WORSHIP OF THE CALF SO TURN  IN REPENTANCE  TO YOUR MAKER AND SLAY YOURSELVES  THE WRONG DOERS   THAT WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU IN THE SIGHT OF YOUR MAKER   THEN HE TURNED TOWARD YOU  IN FORGIVENESS   FOR HE IS OFT RETURNING MOST MERCIFUL 
   AND REMEMBER YE SAID   O MOSES  WE SHALL NEVER BELIEVE IN THEE UNTIL WE SEE GOD MANIFESTLY  BUT YE WERE DAZED WITH THUNDER AND LIGHTNING EVEN AS YE LOOKED ON 
   THEN WE RAISED YOU UP AFTER YOUR DEATH  YE HAD THE CHANCE TO BE GRATEFUL 
   AND WE GAVE YOU THE SHADE OF CLOUDS AND SENT DOWN TO YOU MANNA AND QUAILS SAYING   EAT OF THE GOOD THINGS WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR YOU    BUT THEY REBELLED   TO US THEY DID NO HARM BUT THEY HARMED THEIR OWN SOULS 
   AND REMEMBER WE SAID   ENTER THIS TOWN AND EAT OF THE PLENTY THEREIN AS YE WISH  BUT ENTER THE GATE WITH HUMILITY IN POSTURE AND IN WORDS AND WE SHALL FORGIVE YOU YOUR FAULTS AND INCREASE  THE PORTION OF  THOSE WHO DO GOOD  
   BUT THE TRANSGRESSORS CHANGED THE WORD FROM THAT WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN THEM  SO WE SENT ON THE TRANSGRESSORS A PLAGUE FROM HEAVEN FOR THAT THEY INFRINGED  OUR COMMAND  REPEATEDLY SECTION  
   AND REMEMBER MOSES PRAYED FOR WATER FOR HIS PEOPLE  WE SAID   STRIKE THE ROCK WITH THY STAFF   THEN GUSHED FORTH THEREFROM TWELVE SPRINGS  EACH GROUP KNEW ITS OWN PLACE FOR WATER  SO EAT AND DRINK OF THE SUSTENANCE PROVIDED BY GOD AND DO NO EVIL NOR MISCHIEF ON THE  FACE OF THE  EARTH 
   AND REMEMBER YE SAID   O MOSES  WE CANNOT ENDURE ONE KIND OF FOOD  ALWAYS   SO BESEECH THY LORD FOR US TO PRODUCE FOR US OF WHAT THE EARTH GROWETH ITS POT HERBS AND CUCUMBERS ITS GARLIC LENTILS AND ONIONS   HE SAID   WILL YE EXCHANGE THE BETTER FOR THE WORSE  GO YE DOWN TO ANY TOWN AND YE SHALL FIND WHAT YE WANT   THEY WERE COVERED WITH HUMILIATION AND MISERY  THEY DREW ON THEMSELVES THE WRATH OF GOD  THIS BECAUSE THEY WENT ON REJECTING THE SIGNS OF GOD AND SLAYING HIS MESSENGERS WITHOUT JUST CAUSE  THIS BECAUSE THEY REBELLED AND WENT ON TRANSGRESSING SECTION  
   THOSE WHO BELIEVE  IN THE QUR AN  AND THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE JEWISH  SCRIPTURES  AND THE CHRISTIANS AND THE SABIANS AND WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL HAVE THEIR REWARD WITH THEIR LORD  ON THEM SHALL BE NO FEAR NOR SHALL THEY GRIEVE 
   AND REMEMBER WE TOOK YOUR COVENANT AND WE RAISED ABOVE YOU  THE TOWERING HEIGHT  OF MOUNT  SINAI   SAYING    HOLD FIRMLY TO WHAT WE HAVE GIVEN YOU AND BRING  EVER  TO REMEMBRANCE WHAT IS THEREIN PERCHANCE YE MAY FEAR GOD  
   BUT YE TURNED BACK THEREAFTER HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE GRACE AND MERCY OF GOD TO YOU YE HAD SURELY BEEN AMONG THE LOST 
   AND WELL YE KNEW THOSE AMONGST YOU WHO TRANSGRESSED IN THE MATTER OF THE SABBATH  WE SAID TO THEM   BE YE APES DESPISED AND REJECTED  
   SO WE MADE IT AN EXAMPLE TO THEIR OWN TIME AND TO THEIR POSTERITY AND A LESSON TO THOSE WHO FEAR GOD 
   AND REMEMBER MOSES SAID TO HIS PEOPLE   GOD COMMANDS THAT YE SACRIFICE A HEIFER   THEY SAID   MAKEST THOU A LAUGHING STOCK OF US   HE SAID   GOD SAVE ME FROM BEING AN IGNORANT  FOOL   
   THEY SAID   BESEECH ON OUR BEHALF THY LORD TO MAKE PLAIN TO US WHAT  HEIFER  IT IS  HE SAID   HE SAYS  THE HEIFER SHOULD BE NEITHER TOO OLD NOR TOO YOUNG BUT OF MIDDLING AGE  NOW DO WHAT YE ARE COMMANDED  
   THEY SAID   BESEECH ON OUR BEHALF THY LORD TO MAKE PLAIN TO US HER COLOR   HE SAID    HE SAYS A FAWN COLORED HEIFER PURE AND RICH IN TONE THE ADMIRATION OF BEHOLDERS  
   THEY SAID  BESEECH ON OUR BEHALF THY LORD TO MAKE PLAIN TO US WHAT SHE IS TO US ARE ALL HEIFERS ALIKE  WE WISH INDEED FOR GUIDANCE IF GOD WILLS  
   HE SAID   HE SAYS A HEIFER NOT TRAINED TO TILL THE SOIL OR WATER THE FIELDS  SOUND AND WITHOUT BLEMISH   THEY SAID   NOW HAST THOU BROUGHT THE TRUTH   THEN THEY OFFERED HER IN SACRIFICE BUT NOT WITH GOOD  WILL SECTION  
   REMEMBER YE SLEW A MAN AND FELL INTO A DISPUTE AMONG YOURSELVES AS TO THE CRIME BUT GOD WAS TO BRING FORTH WHAT YE DID HIDE 
   SO WE SAID   STRIKE THE  BODY  WITH A PIECE OF THE  HEIFER    THUS GOD BRINGETH THE DEAD TO LIFE AND SHOWETH YOU HIS SIGNS PERCHANCE YE MAY UNDERSTAND 
   THENCEFORTH WERE YOUR HEARTS HARDENED  THEY BECAME LIKE A ROCK AND EVEN WORSE IN HARDNESS  FOR AMONG ROCKS THERE ARE SOME FROM WHICH RIVERS GUSH FORTH  OTHERS THERE ARE WHICH WHEN SPLIT ASUNDER SEND FORTH WATER  AND OTHERS WHICH SINK FOR FEAR OF GOD  AND GOD IS NOT UNMINDFUL OF WHAT YE DO 
   CAN YE  O YE MEN OF FAITH  ENTERTAIN THE HOPE THAT THEY WILL BELIEVE IN YOU  SEEING THAT A PARTY OF THEM HEARD THE WORD OF GOD AND PERVERTED IT KNOWINGLY AFTER THEY UNDERSTOOD IT 
   BEHOLD  WHEN THEY MEET THE MEN OF FAITH THEY SAY   WE BELIEVE  BUT WHEN THEY MEET EACH OTHER IN PRIVATE THEY SAY   SHALL YOU TELL THEM WHAT GOD HATH REVEALED TO YOU THAT THEY MAY ENGAGE YOU IN ARGUMENT ABOUT IT BEFORE YOUR LORD   DO YE NOT UNDERSTAND  THEIR AIM  
   KNOW THEY NOT THAT GOD KNOWETH WHAT THEY CONCEAL AND WHAT THEY REVEAL 
   AND THERE ARE AMONG THEM ILLITERATES WHO KNOW NOT THE BOOK BUT  SEE THEREIN THEIR OWN  DESIRES AND THEY DO NOTHING BUT CONJECTURE 
   THEN WOE TO THOSE WHO WRITE THE BOOK WITH THEIR OWN HANDS AND THEN SAY   THIS IS FROM GOD  TO TRAFFIC WITH IT FOR A MISERABLE PRICE  WOE TO THEM FOR WHAT THEIR HANDS DO WRITE AND FOR THE GAIN THEY MAKE THEREBY 
   AND THEY SAY   THE FIRE SHALL NOT TOUCH US BUT FOR A FEW NUMBERED DAYS   SAY   HAVE YE TAKEN A PROMISE FROM GOD FOR HE NEVER BREAKS HIS PROMISE  OR IS IT THAT YE SAY OF GOD WHAT YE DO NOT KNOW  
   NAY THOSE WHO SEEK GAIN IN EVIL AND ARE GIRT ROUND BY THEIR SINS THEY ARE COMPANIONS OF THE FIRE THEREIN SHALL THEY ABIDE  FOR EVER  
   BUT THOSE WHO HAVE FAITH AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY ARE COMPANIONS OF THE GARDEN THEREIN SHALL THEY ABIDE  FOR EVER  SECTION  
   AND REMEMBER WE TOOK A COVENANT FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL  TO THIS EFFECT   WORSHIP NONE BUT GOD  TREAT WITH KINDNESS YOUR PARENTS AND KINDRED AND ORPHANS AND THOSE IN NEED  SPEAK FAIR TO THE PEOPLE  BE STEADFAST IN PRAYER  AND PRACTICE REGULAR CHARITY  THEN DID YE TURN BACK EXCEPT A FEW AMONG YOU AND YE BACKSLIDE  EVEN NOW  
   AND REMEMBER WE TOOK YOUR COVENANT  TO THIS EFFECT   SHED NO BLOOD AMONGST YOU NOR TURN OUT YOUR OWN PEOPLE FROM YOUR HOMES  AND THIS YE SOLEMNLY RATIFIED AND TO THIS YE CAN BEAR WITNESS 
   AFTER THIS IT IS YE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO SLAY AMONG YOURSELVES AND BANISH A PARTY OF YOU FROM THEIR HOMES  ASSIST  THEIR ENEMIES  AGAINST THEM IN GUILT AND RANCOR  AND IF THEY COME TO YOU AS CAPTIVES YE RANSOM THEM THOUGH IT WAS NOT LAWFUL FOR YOU TO BANISH THEM  THEN IS IT ONLY A PART OF THE BOOK THAT YE BELIEVE IN AND DO YE REJECT THE REST  BUT WHAT IS THE REWARD FOR THOSE AMONG YOU WHO BEHAVE LIKE THIS BUT DISGRACE IN THIS LIFE  AND ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT THEY SHALL BE CONSIGNED TO THE MOST GRIEVOUS PENALTY  FOR GOD IS NOT UNMINDFUL OF WHAT YE DO 
   THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO BUY THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD AT THE PRICE OF THE HEREAFTER  THEIR PENALTY SHALL NOT BE LIGHTENED NOR SHALL THEY BE HELPED SECTION  
   WE GAVE MOSES THE BOOK AND FOLLOWED HIM UP WITH A SUCCESSION OF APOSTLES  WE GAVE JESUS THE SON OF MARY CLEAR  SIGNS  AND STRENGTHENED HIM WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT  IS IT THAT WHENEVER THERE COMES TO YOU AN APOSTLE WITH WHAT YE YOURSELVES DESIRE NOT YE ARE PUFFED UP WITH PRIDE  SOME YE CALLED IMPOSTORS AND OTHERS YE SLAY 
   THEY SAY  OUR HEARTS ARE THE WRAPPINGS  WHICH PRESERVE GOD S WORD WE NEED NO MORE    NAY GOD S CURSE IS ON THEM FOR THEIR BLASPHEMY  LITTLE IS IT THEY BELIEVE 
   AND WHEN THERE COMES TO THEM A BOOK FROM GOD CONFIRMING WHAT IS WITH THEM ALTHOUGH FROM OF OLD THEY HAD PRAYED FOR VICTORY AGAINST THOSE WITHOUT FAITH WHEN THERE COMES TO THEM THAT WHICH THEY  SHOULD  HAVE RECOGNIZED THEY REFUSED TO BELIEVE IN IT  BUT THE CURSE OF GOD IS ON THOSE WITHOUT FAITH 
   MISERABLE IS THE PRICE FOR WHICH THEY HAVE SOLD THEIR SOULS IN THAT THEY DENY  THE REVELATION  WHICH GOD HAS SENT DOWN IN INSOLENT ENVY THAT GOD OF HIS GRACE SHOULD SEND IT TO ANY OF HIS SERVANTS HE PLEASES  THUS HAVE THEY DRAWN ON THEMSELVES WRATH UPON WRATH  AND HUMILIATING IS THE PUNISHMENT OF THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH 
   WHEN IT IS SAID TO THEM   BELIEVE IN WHAT GOD HATH SENT DOWN  THEY SAY  WE BELIEVE IN WHAT WAS SENT DOWN TO US   YET THEY REJECT ALL BESIDES EVEN IF IT BE TRUTH CONFIRMING WHAT IS WITH THEM  SAY   WHY THEN HAVE YE SLAIN THE PROPHETS OF GOD IN TIMES GONE BY IF YE DID INDEED BELIEVE  
   THERE CAME TO YOU MOSES WITH CLEAR  SIGNS   YET YE WORSHIPPED THE CALF  EVEN  AFTER THAT AND YE DID BEHAVE WRONGFULLY 
   AND REMEMBER WE TOOK YOUR COVENANT AND WE RAISED ABOVE YOU  THE TOWERING HEIGHT  OF MOUNT  SINAI   SAYING    HOLD FIRMLY TO WHAT WE HAVE GIVEN YOU AND HEARKEN  TO THE LAW    THEY SAID   WE HEAR AND WE DISOBEY   AND THEY HAD TO DRINK INTO THEIR HEARTS  OF THE TAINT  OF THE CALF BECAUSE OF THEIR FAITHLESSNESS  SAY   VILE INDEED ARE THE BEHESTS OF YOUR FAITH IF YE HAVE ANY FAITH  
   SAY   IF THE LAST HOME WITH GOD BE FOR YOU SPECIALLY AND NOT FOR ANYONE ELSE THEN SEEK YE FOR DEATH IF YE ARE SINCERE  
   BUT THEY WILL NEVER SEEK FOR DEATH ON ACCOUNT OF THE  SINS  WHICH THEIR HANDS HAVE SENT ON BEFORE THEM  AND GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE WRONG DOERS 
   THOU WILT INDEED FIND THEM OF ALL PEOPLE MOST GREEDY OF LIFE EVEN MORE THAN THE IDOLATERS  EACH ONE OF THEM WISHES HE COULD BE GIVEN A LIFE OF A THOUSAND YEARS  BUT THE GRANT OF SUCH LIFE WILL NOT SAVE HIM FROM  DUE  PUNISHMENT FOR GOD SEES WELL ALL THAT THEY DO SECTION  
   SAY  WHOEVER IS AN ENEMY TO GABRIEL FOR HE BRINGS DOWN THE  REVELATION  TO THY HEART BY GOD S WILL A CONFIRMATION OF WHAT WENT BEFORE AND GUIDANCE AND GLAD TIDINGS FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE 
   WHOEVER IS AN ENEMY TO GOD AND HIS ANGELS AND APOSTLES TO GABRIEL AND MICHAEL LO  GOD IS AN ENEMY TO THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH 
   WE HAVE SENT DOWN TO THEE MANIFEST SIGNS  AYAT   AND NONE REJECT THEM BUT THOSE WHO ARE PERVERSE 
   IS IT NOT  THE CASE  THAT EVERY TIME THEY MAKE A COVENANT SOME PARTY AMONG THEM THROW IT ASIDE    NAY MOST OF THEM ARE FAITHLESS 
   AND WHEN CAME TO THEM AN APOSTLE FROM GOD CONFIRMING WHAT WAS WITH THEM A PARTY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK THREW AWAY THE BOOK OF GOD BEHIND THEIR BACKS AS IF  IT HAD BEEN SOMETHING  THEY DID NOT KNOW 
   THEY FOLLOWED WHAT THE EVIL ONES GAVE OUT  FALSELY  AGAINST THE POWER OF SOLOMON  THE BLASPHEMERS WERE NOT SOLOMON BUT THE EVIL ONES TEACHING MEN MAGIC AND SUCH THINGS AS CAME DOWN AT BABYLON TO THE ANGELS HARUT AND MARUT  BUT NEITHER OF THESE TAUGHT ANYONE  SUCH THINGS  WITHOUT SAYING   WE ARE ONLY FOR TRIAL SO DO NOT BLASPHEME   THEY LEARNED FROM THEM THE MEANS TO SOW DISCORD BETWEEN MAN AND WIFE  BUT THEY COULD NOT THUS HARM ANYONE EXCEPT BY GOD S PERMISSION  AND THEY LEARNED WHAT HARMED THEM NOT WHAT PROFITED THEM  AND THEY KNEW THAT THE BUYERS OF  MAGIC  WOULD HAVE NO SHARE IN THE HAPPINESS OF THE HEREAFTER  AND VILE WAS THE PRICE FOR WHICH THEY DID SELL THEIR SOULS IF THEY BUT KNEW 
   IF THEY HAD KEPT THEIR FAITH AND GUARDED THEMSELVES FROM EVIL FAR BETTER HAD BEEN THE REWARD FROM THEIR LORD IF THEY BUT KNEW SECTION  
   O YE OF FAITH  SAY NOT  TO THE APOSTLE  WORDS OF AMBIGUOUS IMPORT BUT WORDS OF RESPECT  AND HEARKEN  TO HIM   TO THOSE WITHOUT FAITH IS A GRIEVOUS PUNISHMENT 
   IT IS NEVER THE WISH OF THOSE WITHOUT FAITH AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK NOR OF THE PAGANS THAT ANYTHING GOOD SHOULD COME DOWN TO YOU FROM YOUR LORD  BUT GOD WILL CHOOSE FOR HIS SPECIAL MERCY WHOM HE WILL FOR GOD IS LORD OF GRACE ABOUNDING 
   NONE OF OUR REVELATIONS DO WE ABROGATE OR CAUSE TO BE FORGOTTEN BUT WE SUBSTITUTE SOMETHING BETTER OR SIMILAR  KNOWEST THOU NOT THAT GOD HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   KNOWEST THOU NOT THAT TO GOD BELONGETH THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND BESIDES HIM YE HAVE NEITHER PATRON NOR HELPER 
   WOULD YE QUESTION YOUR APOSTLE AS MOSES WAS QUESTIONED OF OLD  BUT WHOEVER CHANGETH FROM FAITH TO UNBELIEF HATH STRAYED WITHOUT DOUBT FROM THE EVEN WAY 
   QUITE A NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK WISH THEY COULD TURN YOU  PEOPLE  BACK TO INFIDELITY AFTER YE HAVE BELIEVED FROM SELFISH ENVY AFTER THE TRUTH HATH BECOME MANIFEST UNTO THEM  BUT FORGIVE AND OVERLOOK TILL GOD ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE  FOR GOD HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   AND BE STEADFAST IN PRAYER AND REGULAR IN CHARITY  AND WHATEVER GOOD YE SEND FORTH FOR YOUR SOULS BEFORE YOU YE SHALL FIND IT WITH GOD  FOR GOD SEES WELL ALL THAT YE DO 
   AND THEY SAY   NONE SHALL ENTER PARADISE UNLESS HE BE A JEW OR A CHRISTIAN   THOSE ARE THEIR  VAIN  DESIRES  SAY   PRODUCE YOUR PROOF IF YE ARE TRUTHFUL  
   NAY WHOEVER SUBMITS HIS WHOLE SELF TO GOD AND IS A DOER OF GOOD HE WILL GET HIS REWARD WITH HIS LORD  ON SUCH SHALL BE NO FEAR NOR SHALL THEY GRIEVE SECTION  
   THE JEWS SAY   THE CHRISTIANS HAVE NAUGHT  TO STAND  UPON   AND THE CHRISTIANS SAY   THE JEWS HAVE NAUGHT  TO STAND  UPON   YET THEY  PROFESS TO  STUDY THE  SAME  BOOK  LIKE UNTO THEIR WORD IS WHAT THOSE SAY WHO KNOW NOT BUT GOD WILL JUDGE BETWEEN THEM IN THEIR QUARREL ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 
   AND WHO IS MORE UNJUST THAN HE WHO FORBIDS THAT IN PLACES FOR THE WORSHIP OF GOD GOD S NAME SHOULD BE CELEBRATED  WHOSE ZEAL IS  IN FACT  TO RUIN THEM  IT WAS NOT FITTING THAT SUCH SHOULD THEMSELVES ENTER THEM EXCEPT IN FEAR  FOR THEM THERE IS NOTHING BUT DISGRACE IN THIS WORLD AND IN THE WORLD TO COME AN EXCEEDING TORMENT 
   TO GOD BELONG THE EAST AND THE WEST  WHITHERSOEVER YE TURN THERE IS THE PRESENCE OF GOD  FOR GOD IS ALL PERVADING ALL KNOWING 
   THEY SAY   GOD HATH BEGOTTEN A SON   GLORY BE TO HIM  NAY TO HIM BELONGS ALL THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  EVERYTHING RENDERS WORSHIP TO HIM 
   TO HIM IS DUE THE PRIMAL ORIGIN OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  WHEN HE DECREETH A MATTER HE SAITH TO IT   BE   AND IT IS 
   SAY THOSE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE   WHY SPEAKETH NOT GOD UNTO US  OR WHY COMETH NOT UNTO US A SIGN   SO SAID THE PEOPLE BEFORE THEM WORDS OF SIMILAR IMPORT  THEIR HEARTS ARE ALIKE  WE HAVE INDEED MADE CLEAR THE SIGNS UNTO ANY PEOPLE WHO HOLD FIRMLY TO FAITH  IN THEIR HEARTS  
   VERILY WE HAVE SENT THEE IN TRUTH AS A BEARER OF GLAD TIDINGS AND A WARNER  BUT OF THEE NO QUESTION SHALL BE ASKED OF COMPANIONS OF THE BLAZING FIRE 
   NEVER WILL THE JEWS OR THE CHRISTIANS BE SATISFIED WITH THEE UNLESS THOU FOLLOW THEIR FORM OF RELIGION  SAY   THE GUIDANCE OF GOD THAT IS THE  ONLY  GUIDANCE   WERT THOU TO FOLLOW THEIR DESIRES AFTER THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH HATH REACHED THEE THEN WOULDST THOU FIND NEITHER PROTECTOR NOR HELPER AGAINST GOD 
   THOSE TO WHOM WE HAVE SENT THE BOOK STUDY IT AS IT SHOULD BE STUDIED  THEY ARE THE ONES THAT BELIEVE THEREIN  THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH THEREIN THE LOSS IS THEIR OWN SECTION  
   O CHILDREN OF ISRAEL  CALL TO MIND THE SPECIAL FAVOR WHICH I BESTOWED UPON YOU AND THAT I PREFERRED YOU TO ALL OTHERS  FOR MY MESSAGE  
   THEN GUARD YOURSELVES AGAINST A DAY WHEN ONE SOUL SHALL NOT AVAIL ANOTHER NOR SHALL COMPENSATION BE ACCEPTED FROM HER NOR SHALL INTERCESSION PROFIT HER NOR SHALL ANYONE BE HELPED  FROM OUTSIDE  
   AND REMEMBER THAT ABRAHAM WAS TRIED BY HIS LORD WITH CERTAIN COMMANDS WHICH HE FULFILLED  HE SAID   I WILL MAKE THEE AN IMAM TO THE NATIONS   HE PLEADED   AND ALSO  IMAMS  FROM MY OFFSPRING   HE ANSWERED   BUT MY PROMISE IS NOT WITHIN THE REACH OF EVIL DOERS  
   REMEMBER WE MADE THE HOUSE A PLACE OF ASSEMBLY FOR MEN AND A PLACE OF SAFETY  AND TAKE YE THE STATION OF ABRAHAM AS A PLACE OF PRAYER  AND WE COVENANTED WITH ABRAHAM AND ISMA IL THAT THEY SHOULD SANCTIFY MY HOUSE FOR THOSE WHO COMPASS IT ROUND OR USE IT AS A RETREAT OR BOW OR PROSTRATE THEMSELVES  THEREIN IN PRAYER  
   AND REMEMBER ABRAHAM SAID   MY LORD MAKE THIS A CITY OF PEACE AND FEED ITS PEOPLE WITH FRUITS SUCH OF THEM AS BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY   HE SAID    YEA  AND SUCH AS REJECT FAITH FOR A WHILE WILL I GRANT THEM THEIR PLEASURE BUT WILL SOON DRIVE THEM TO THE TORMENT OF FIRE AN EVIL DESTINATION  INDEED   
   AND REMEMBER ABRAHAM AND ISMA IL RAISED THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE HOUSE  WITH THIS PRAYER    OUR LORD  ACCEPT  THIS SERVICE  FROM US FOR THOU ART THE ALL HEARING THE ALL KNOWING 
    OUR LORD  MAKE OF US MUSLIMS BOWING TO THY  WILL  AND OF OUR PROGENY A PEOPLE MUSLIM BOWING TO THY  WILL  AND SHOW US OUR PLACES FOR THE CELEBRATION OF  DUE  RITES  AND TURN UNTO US  IN MERCY   FOR THOU ART THE OFT RETURNING MOST MERCIFUL 
    OUR LORD  SEND AMONGST THEM AN APOSTLE OF THEIR OWN WHO SHALL REHEARSE THY SIGNS TO THEM AND INSTRUCT THEM IN SCRIPTURE AND WISDOM AND SANCTIFY THEM  FOR THOU ART THE EXALTED IN MIGHT THE WISE  SECTION  
   AND WHO TURNS AWAY FROM THE RELIGION OF ABRAHAM BUT SUCH AS DEBASE THEIR SOULS WITH FOLLY  HIM WE CHOSE AND RENDERED PURE IN THIS WORLD  AND HE WILL BE IN THE HEREAFTER IN THE RANKS OF THE RIGHTEOUS 
   BEHOLD  HIS LORD SAID TO HIM   BOW  THY WILL TO ME   HE SAID   I BOW  MY WILL  TO THE LORD AND CHERISHER OF THE UNIVERSE  
   AND THIS WAS THE LEGACY THAT ABRAHAM LEFT TO HIS SONS AND SO DID JACOB   O MY SONS  GOD HATH CHOSEN THE FAITH FOR YOU  THEN DIE NOT EXCEPT IN THE FAITH OF ISLAM  
   WERE YE WITNESSES WHEN DEATH APPEARED BEFORE JACOB  BEHOLD HE SAID TO HIS SONS   WHAT WILL YE WORSHIP AFTER ME   THEY SAID   WE SHALL WORSHIP THY GOD AND THE GOD OF THY FATHERS OF ABRAHAM ISMA IL AND ISAAC THE ONE  TRUE  GOD TO HIM WE BOW  IN ISLAM   
   THAT WAS A PEOPLE THAT HATH PASSED AWAY  THEY SHALL REAP THE FRUIT OF WHAT THEY DID AND YE OF WHAT YE DO  OF THEIR MERITS THERE IS NO QUESTION IN YOUR CASE 
   THEY SAY   BECOME JEWS OR CHRISTIANS IF YE WOULD BE GUIDED  TO SALVATION    SAY THOU   NAY   I WOULD RATHER  THE RELIGION OF ABRAHAM THE TRUE AND HE JOINED NOT GODS WITH GOD  
   SAY YE   WE BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE REVELATION GIVEN TO US AND TO ABRAHAM ISMA IL ISAAC JACOB AND THE TRIBES AND THAT GIVEN TO MOSES AND JESUS AND THAT GIVEN TO  ALL  PROPHETS FROM THEIR LORD WE MAKE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE AND ANOTHER OF THEM AND WE BOW TO GOD  IN ISLAM   
   SO IF THEY BELIEVE AS YE BELIEVE THEY ARE INDEED ON THE RIGHT PATH  BUT IF THEY TURN BACK IT IS THEY WHO ARE IN SCHISM  BUT GOD WILL SUFFICE THEE AS AGAINST THEM AND HE IS THE ALL HEARING THE ALL  KNOWING 
    OUR RELIGION IS  THE BAPTISM OF GOD  AND WHO CAN BAPTIZE BETTER THAN GOD  AND IT IS HE WHOM WE WORSHIP 
   SAY  WILL YE DISPUTE WITH US ABOUT GOD SEEING THAT HE IS OUR LORD AND YOUR LORD  THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR DOINGS AND YE FOR YOURS  AND THAT WE ARE SINCERE  IN OUR FAITH  IN HIM 
   OR DO YE SAY THAT ABRAHAM ISMA IL ISAAC JACOB AND THE TRIBES WERE JEWS OR CHRISTIANS  SAY  DO YE KNOW BETTER THAN GOD  AH  WHO IS MORE UNJUST THAN THOSE WHO CONCEAL THE TESTIMONY THEY HAVE FROM GOD  BUT GOD IS NOT UNMINDFUL OF WHAT YE DO 
   THAT WAS A PEOPLE THAT HATH PASSED AWAY  THEY SHALL REAP THE FRUIT OF WHAT THEY DID AND YE OF WHAT YE DO  OF THEIR MERITS THERE IS NO QUESTION IN YOUR CASE SECTION  
   THE FOOLS AMONG THE PEOPLE WILL SAY   WHAT HATH TURNED THEM FROM THE QIBLAH TO WHICH THEY WERE USED   SAY  TO GOD BELONG BOTH EAST AND WEST  HE GUIDETH WHOM HE WILL TO A WAY THAT IS STRAIGHT

   A SIMILAR  FAVOR HAVE YE ALREADY RECEIVED  IN THAT WE HAVE SENT AMONG YOU AN APOSTLE OF YOUR OWN REHEARSING TO YOU OUR SIGNS AND SANCTIFYING YOU AND INSTRUCTING YOU IN SCRIPTURE AND WISDOM AND IN NEW KNOWLEDGE 
   THEN DO YE REMEMBER ME  I WILL REMEMBER YOU  BE GRATEFUL TO ME AND REJECT NOT FAITH SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  SEEK HELP WITH PATIENT PERSEVERANCE AND PRAYER  FOR GOD IS WITH THOSE WHO PATIENTLY PERSEVERE

   BE SURE WE SHALL TEST YOU WITH SOMETHING OF FEAR AND HUNGER SOME LOSS IN GOODS OR LIVES OR THE FRUITS  OF YOUR TOIL  BUT GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO THOSE WHO PATIENTLY PERSEVERE 
   WHO SAY WHEN AFFLICTED WITH CALAMITY    TO GOD WE BELONG AND TO HIM IS OUR RETURN  
   THEY ARE THOSE ON WHOM  DESCEND  BLESSINGS FROM GOD AND MERCY AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT RECEIVE GUIDANCE 
   BEHOLD  SAFA AND MARWA ARE AMONG THE SYMBOLS OF GOD  SO IF THOSE WHO VISIT THE HOUSE IN THE SEASON OR AT OTHER TIMES SHOULD COMPASS THEM ROUND IT IS NO SIN IN THEM  AND IF ANYONE OBEYETH HIS OWN IMPULSE TO GOOD BE SURE THAT GOD IS HE WHO RECOGNISETH AND KNOWETH 
   THOSE WHO CONCEAL THE CLEAR  SIGNS  WE HAVE SENT DOWN AND THE GUIDANCE AFTER WE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BOOK ON THEM SHALL BE GOD S CURSE AND THE CURSE OF THOSE ENTITLED TO CURSE 
   EXCEPT THOSE WHO REPENT AND MAKE AMENDS AND OPENLY DECLARE  THE TRUTH  TO THEM I TURN  FOR I AM OFT RETURNING MOST MERCIFUL

   YET THERE ARE MEN WHO TAKE  FOR WORSHIP  OTHERS BESIDES GOD AS EQUAL  WITH GOD   THEY LOVE THEM AS THEY SHOULD LOVE GOD  BUT THOSE OF FAITH ARE OVERFLOWING IN THEIR LOVE FOR GOD  IF ONLY THE UNRIGHTEOUS COULD SEE BEHOLD THEY WOULD SEE THE PENALTY THAT TO GOD BELONGS ALL POWER AND GOD WILL STRONGLY ENFORCE THE PENALTY 
   THEN WOULD THOSE WHO ARE FOLLOWED CLEAR THEMSELVES OF THOSE WHO FOLLOW  THEM   THEY WOULD SEE THE PENALTY AND ALL RELATIONS BETWEEN THEM WOULD BE CUT OFF 
   AND THOSE WHO FOLLOWED WOULD SAY   IF ONLY WE HAD ONE MORE CHANCE WE WOULD CLEAR OURSELVES OF THEM AS THEY HAVE CLEARED THEMSELVES OF US   THUS WILL GOD SHOW THEM  THE FRUITS OF  THEIR DEEDS AS  NOTHING BUT  REGRETS NOR WILL THERE BE A WAY FOR THEM OUT OF THE FIRE SECTION

   THOSE WHO CONCEAL GOD S REVELATIONS IN THE BOOK AND PURCHASE FOR THEM A MISERABLE PROFIT THEY SWALLOW INTO THEMSELVES NAUGHT BUT FIRE  GOD WILL NOT ADDRESS THEM ON THE DAY OF RESURRECTION NOR PURIFY THEM  GRIEVOUS WILL BE THEIR PENALTY  
   THEY ARE THE ONES WHO BUY ERROR IN PLACE OF GUIDANCE AND TORMENT IN PLACE OF FORGIVENESS  AH  WHAT BOLDNESS  THEY SHOW  FOR THE FIRE  
    THEIR DOOM IS  BECAUSE GOD SENT DOWN THE BOOK IN TRUTH BUT THOSE WHO SEEK CAUSES OF DISPUTE IN THE BOOK ARE IN A SCHISM FAR  FROM THE PURPOSE  SECTION  
   IT IS NOT RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT YE TURN YOUR FACES TOWARD EAST OR WEST  BUT IT IS RIGHTEOUSNESS TO BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY AND THE ANGELS AND THE BOOK AND THE MESSENGERS  TO SPEND OF YOUR SUBSTANCE OUT OF LOVE FOR HIM FOR YOUR KIN FOR ORPHANS FOR THE NEEDY FOR THE WAYFARER FOR THOSE WHO ASK AND FOR THE RANSOM OF SLAVES  TO BE STEADFAST IN PRAYER AND PRACTICE REGULAR CHARITY  TO FULFIL THE CONTRACTS WHICH YE HAVE MADE  AND TO BE FIRM AND PATIENT IN PAIN  OR SUFFERING  AND ADVERSITY AND THROUGHOUT ALL PERIODS OF PANIC  SUCH ARE THE PEOPLE OF TRUTH THE GOD FEARING

   IN THE LAW OF EQUALITY THERE IS  SAVING OF  LIFE TO YOU O YE MEN OF UNDERSTANDING  THAT YE MAY RESTRAIN YOURSELVES 
   IT IS PRESCRIBED WHEN DEATH APPROACHES ANY OF YOU IF HE LEAVE ANY GOODS THAT HE MAKE A BEQUEST TO PARENTS AND NEXT OF KIN ACCORDING TO REASONABLE USAGE  THIS IS DUE FROM THE GOD FEARING 
   IF ANYONE CHANGES THE BEQUEST AFTER HEARING IT THE GUILT SHALL BE ON THOSE WHO MAKE THE CHANGE  FOR GOD HEARS AND KNOWS ALL THINGS 
   BUT IF ANYONE FEARS PARTIALITY OR WRONG DOING ON THE PART OF THE TESTATOR AND MAKES PEACE BETWEEN  THE PARTIES CONCERNED  THERE IS NO WRONG IN HIM  FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  FASTING IS PRESCRIBED TO YOU AS IT WAS PRESCRIBED TO THOSE BEFORE YOU THAT YE MAY  LEARN  SELF RESTRAINT 
    FASTING  FOR A FIXED NUMBER OF DAYS  BUT IF ANY OF YOU IS ILL OR ON A JOURNEY THE PRESCRIBED NUMBER  SHOULD BE MADE UP  FROM DAYS LATER  FOR THOSE WHO CAN DO IT  WITH HARDSHIP  IS A RANSOM THE FEEDING OF ONE THAT IS INDIGENT  BUT HE THAT WILL GIVE MORE OF HIS OWN FREE WILL IT IS BETTER FOR HIM AND IT IS BETTER FOR YOU THAT YE FAST IF YE ONLY KNEW

   PERMITTED TO YOU ON THE NIGHT OF THE FASTS IS THE APPROACH TO YOUR WIVES  THEY ARE YOUR GARMENTS  AND YE ARE THEIR GARMENTS  GOD KNOWETH WHAT YE USED TO DO SECRETLY AMONG YOURSELVES  BUT HE TURNED TO YOU AND FORGAVE YOU  SO NOW ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AND SEEK WHAT GOD HATH ORDAINED FOR YOU AND EAT AND DRINK UNTIL THE WHITE THREAD OF DAWN APPEAR TO YOU DISTINCT FROM ITS BLACK THREAD  THEN COMPLETE YOUR FAST TILL THE NIGHT APPEARS  BUT DO NOT ASSOCIATE WITH YOUR WIVES WHILE YE ARE IN RETREAT IN THE MOSQUES  THOSE ARE LIMITS  SET BY  GOD  APPROACH NOT NIGH THERETO  THUS DOTH GOD MAKE CLEAR HIS SIGNS TO MEN THAT THEY MAY LEARN SELF RESTRAINT

   FIGHT IN THE CAUSE OF GOD THOSE WHO FIGHT YOU BUT DO NOT TRANSGRESS LIMITS  FOR GOD LOVETH NOT TRANSGRESSORS 
   AND SLAY THEM WHEREVER YE CATCH THEM AND TURN THEM OUT FROM WHERE THEY HAVE TURNED YOU OUT  FOR TUMULT AND OPPRESSION ARE WORSE THAN SLAUGHTER  BUT FIGHT THEM NOT AT THE SACRED MOSQUE UNLESS THEY  FIRST  FIGHT YOU THERE  BUT IF THEY FIGHT YOU SLAY THEM  SUCH IS THE REWARD OF THOSE WHO SUPPRESS FAITH 
   BUT IF THEY CEASE GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   AND FIGHT THEM ON UNTIL THERE IS NO MORE TUMULT OR OPPRESSION AND THERE PREVAIL JUSTICE AND FAITH IN GOD  BUT IF THEY CEASE LET THERE BE NO HOSTILITY EXCEPT TO THOSE WHO PRACTICE OPPRESSION 
   THE PROHIBITED MONTH FOR THE PROHIBITED MONTH AND SO FOR ALL THINGS PROHIBITED THERE IS THE LAW OF EQUALITY  IF THEN ANYONE TRANSGRESSES THE PROHIBITION AGAINST YOU TRANSGRESS YE LIKEWISE AGAINST HIM  BUT FEAR GOD AND KNOW THAT GOD IS WITH THOSE WHO RESTRAIN THEMSELVES

   IT IS NO CRIME IN YOU IF YE SEEK OF THE BOUNTY OF YOUR LORD  DURING PILGRIMAGE   THEN WHEN YE POUR DOWN FROM  MOUNT  ARAFAT CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF GOD AT THE SACRED MONUMENT AND CELEBRATE HIS PRAISES AS HE HAS DIRECTED YOU EVEN THOUGH BEFORE THIS YE WENT ASTRAY 
   THEN PASS ON AT A QUICK PACE FROM THE PLACE WHENCE IT IS USUAL FOR THE MULTITUDE SO TO DO AND ASK FOR GOD S FORGIVENESS  FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   SO WHEN YE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED YOUR HOLY RITES CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF GOD AS YE USED TO CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF YOUR FATHERS YEA WITH FAR MORE HEART AND SOUL  THERE ARE MEN WHO SAY   OUR LORD  GIVE US  THY BOUNTIES  IN THIS WORLD   BUT THEY WILL HAVE NO PORTION IN THE HEREAFTER 
   AND THERE ARE MEN WHO SAY   OUR LORD  GIVE US GOOD IN THIS WORLD AND GOOD IN THE HEREAFTER AND DEFEND US FROM THE TORMENT ON THE FIRE  
   TO THESE WILL BE ALLOTTED WHAT THEY HAVE EARNED AND GOD IS QUICK IN ACCOUNT 
   CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF GOD DURING THE APPOINTED DAYS BUT IF ANYONE HASTENS TO LEAVE IN TWO DAYS THERE IS NO BLAME ON HIM AND IF ANYONE STAYS ON THERE IS NO BLAME ON HIM IF HIS AIMS IS TO DO RIGHT  THEN FEAR GOD AND KNOW THAT YE WILL SURELY BE GATHERED UNTO HIM

   WHEN HE TURNS HIS BACK HIS AIM EVERYWHERE IS TO SPREAD MISCHIEF THROUGH THE EARTH AND DESTROY CROPS AND CATTLE  BUT GOD LOVETH NOT MISCHIEF 
   WHEN IT IS SAID TO HIM  FEAR GOD  HE IS LED BY ARROGANCE TO  MORE  CRIME  ENOUGH FOR HIM IS HELL  AN EVIL BED INDEED  TO LIE ON  
   AND THERE IS THE TYPE OF MAN WHO GIVES HIS LIFE TO EARN THE PLEASURE OF GOD  AND GOD IS FULL OF KINDNESS TO  HIS  DEVOTEES 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  ENTER INTO ISLAM WHOLE HEARTEDLY  AND FOLLOW NOT THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE EVIL ONE  FOR HE IS TO YOU AN AVOWED ENEMY

   MANKIND WAS ONE SINGLE NATION AND GOD SENT MESSENGERS WITH GLAD TIDINGS AND WARNINGS  AND WITH THEM HE SENT THE BOOK IN TRUTH TO JUDGE BETWEEN PEOPLE IN MATTERS WHEREIN THEY DIFFERED  BUT THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK AFTER THE CLEAR SIGNS CAME TO THEM DID NOT DIFFER AMONG THEMSELVES EXCEPT THROUGH SELFISH CONTUMACY  GOD BY HIS GRACE GUIDED THE BELIEVERS TO THE TRUTH CONCERNING THAT WHEREIN THEY DIFFERED  FOR GOD GUIDES WHOM HE WILL TO A PATH THAT IS STRAIGHT 
   OR DO YE THINK THAT YE SHALL ENTER THE GARDEN  OF BLISS  WITHOUT SUCH  TRIALS  AS CAME TO THOSE WHO PASSED AWAY BEFORE YOU  THEY ENCOUNTERED SUFFERING AND ADVERSITY AND WERE SO SHAKEN IN SPIRIT THAT EVEN THE APOSTLE AND THOSE OF FAITH WHO WERE WITH HIM CRIED   WHEN  WILL COME  THE HELP OF GOD   AH  VERILY THE HELP OF GOD IS  ALWAYS  NEAR

   WHEN JESUS FOUND UNBELIEF ON THEIR PART HE SAID   WHO WILL BE MY HELPERS TO  THE WORK OF  GOD   SAID THE DISCIPLES   WE ARE GOD S HELPERS WE BELIEVE IN GOD AND DO THOU BEAR WITNESS THAT WE ARE MUSLIMS 
    OUR LORD  WE BELIEVE IN WHAT THOU HAST REVEALED AND WE FOLLOW THE APOSTLE  THEN WRITE US DOWN AMONG THOSE WHO BEAR WITNESS  
   AND  THEN UNBELIEVERS  PLOTTED AND PLANNED AND GOD TOO PLANNED AND THE BEST OF PLANNERS IS GOD SECTION  
   BEHOLD  GOD SAID   O JESUS  I WILL TAKE THEE AND RAISE THEE TO MYSELF AND CLEAR THEE  OF THE FALSEHOODS  OF THOSE WHO BLASPHEME  I WILL MAKE THOSE WHO FOLLOW THEE SUPERIOR TO THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH TO THE DAY OF RESURRECTION  THEN SHALL YE ALL RETURN UNTO ME AND I WILL JUDGE BETWEEN YOU OF THE MATTERS WHEREIN YE DISPUTE

    AS TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS GOD WILL PAY THEM  IN FULL  THEIR REWARD  BUT GOD LOVETH NOT THOSE WHO DO WRONG 
    THIS IS WHAT WE REHEARSE UNTO THEE OF THE SIGNS AND THE MESSAGE OF WISDOM  
   THE SIMILITUDE OF JESUS BEFORE GOD IS AS THAT OF ADAM  HE CREATED HIM FROM DUST THEN SAID TO HIM   BE  AND HE WAS 
   THE TRUTH  COMES  FROM GOD ALONE  SO BE NOT OF THOSE WHO DOUBT

   YE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK  WHY DISPUTE YE ABOUT ABRAHAM WHEN THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL WERE NOT REVEALED TILL AFTER HIM  HAVE YE NO UNDER  STANDING 
   AH  YE ARE THOSE WHO FELL TO DISPUTING  EVEN  IN MATTERS OF WHICH YE HAD SOME KNOWLEDGE  BUT WHY DISPUTE YE IN MATTERS OF WHICH YE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE  IT IS GOD WHO KNOWS AND YE WHO KNOW NOT 
   ABRAHAM WAS NOT A JEW NOR YET A CHRISTIAN BUT HE WAS TRUE IN FAITH AND BOWED HIS WILL TO GOD S  WHICH IS ISLAM  AND HE JOINED NOT GODS WITH GOD 
   WITHOUT DOUBT AMONG MEN THE NEAREST OF KIN TO ABRAHAM ARE THOSE WHO FOLLOW HIM AS ARE ALSO THIS APOSTLE AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE  AND GOD IS THE PROTECTOR OF THOSE WHO HAVE FAITH 
   IT IS THE WISH OF A SECTION OF THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK TO LEAD YOU ASTRAY  BUT THEY SHALL LEAD ASTRAY  NOT YOU  BUT THEMSELVES AND THEY DO NOT PERCEIVE 
   YE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK  WHY REJECT YE THE SIGNS OF GOD OF WHICH YE ARE  YOURSELVES  WITNESSES 
   YE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK  WHY DO YE CLOTHE TRUTH WITH FALSEHOOD AND CONCEAL THE TRUTH WHILE YE HAVE KNOWLEDGE SECTION  
   A SECTION OF THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK SAY   BELIEVE IN THE MORNING WHAT IS REVEALED TO THE BELIEVERS BUT REJECT IT AT THE END OF THE DAY  PERCHANCE THEY MAY  THEMSELVES  TURN BACK 
    AND BELIEVE NO ONE UNLESS HE FOLLOWS YOUR RELIGION   SAY   TRUE GUIDANCE IS THE GUIDANCE OF GOD   FEAR YE  LEST A REVELATION BE SENT TO SOMEONE  ELSE  LIKE UNTO THAT WHICH WAS SENT UNTO YOU  OR THAT THOSE  RECEIVING SUCH REVELATION  SHOULD ENGAGE YOU IN ARGUMENT BEFORE YOUR LORD   SAY   ALL BOUNTIES ARE IN THE HAND OF GOD  HE GRANTETH THEM TO WHOM HE PLEASETH  AND GOD CARETH FOR ALL AND HE KNOWETH ALL THINGS  
   FOR HIS MERCY HE SPECIALLY CHOOSETH WHOM HE PLEASETH  FOR GOD IS THE LORD OF BOUNTIES UNBOUNDED 
   AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK ARE SOME WHO IF ENTRUSTED WITH A HOARD OF GOLD WILL  READILY  PAY IT BACK  OTHERS WHO IF ENTRUSTED WITH A SINGLE SILVER COIN WILL NOT REPAY IT UNLESS THOU CONSTANTLY STOODEST DEMANDING BECAUSE THEY SAY  THERE IS NO CALL ON US  TO KEEP FAITH  WITH THESE IGNORANT  PAGANS    BUT THEY TELL A LIE AGAINST GOD AND  WELL  THEY KNOW IT 
   NAY  THOSE THAT KEEP THEIR PLIGHTED FAITH AND ACT ARIGHT VERILY GOD LOVES THOSE WHO ACT ARIGHT 
   AS FOR THOSE WHO SELL THE FAITH THEY OWE TO GOD AND THEIR OWN PLIGHTED WORD FOR A SMALL PRICE THEY SHALL HAVE NO PORTION IN THE HEREAFTER  NOR WILL GOD  DEIGN TO  SPEAK TO THEM OR LOOK AT THEM ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT NOR WILL HE CLEANSE THEM  OF SIN   THEY SHALL HAVE A GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   THERE IS AMONG THEM A SECTION WHO DISTORT THE BOOK WITH THEIR TONGUES   AS THEY READ  YOU WOULD THINK IT IS A PART OF THE BOOK BUT IT IS NO PART OF THE BOOK  AND THEY SAY  THAT IS FROM GOD  BUT IT IS NOT FROM GOD  IT IS THEY WHO TELL A LIE AGAINST GOD AND  WELL  THEY KNOW IT 
   IT IS NOT  POSSIBLE  THAT A MAN TO WHOM IS GIVEN THE BOOK AND WISDOM AND THE PROPHETIC OFFICE SHOULD SAY TO PEOPLE   BE YE MY WORSHIPPERS RATHER THAN GOD S  ON THE CONTRARY  HE WOULD SAY    BE YE WORSHIPPERS OF HIM WHO IS TRULY THE CHERISHER OF ALL FOR YE HAVE TAUGHT THE BOOK AND YE HAVE STUDIED IT EARNESTLY  
   NOR WOULD HE INSTRUCT YOU TO TAKE ANGELS AND PROPHETS FOR LORDS AND PATRONS  WHAT  WOULD HE BID YOU TO UNBELIEF AFTER YE HAVE BOWED YOUR WILL  TO GOD IN ISLAM  SECTION  
   BEHOLD  GOD TOOK THE COVENANT OF THE PROPHETS SAYING   I GIVE YOU A BOOK AND WISDOM  THEN COMES TO YOU AN APOSTLE CONFIRMING WHAT IS WITH YOU  DO YE BELIEVE HIM AND RENDER HIM HELP   GOD SAID   DO YE AGREE AND TAKE THIS MY COVENANT AS BINDING ON YOU   THEY SAID   WE AGREE   HE SAID   THEN BEAR WITNESS AND I AM WITH YOU AMONG THE WITNESSES

   IF ANYONE DESIRES A RELIGION OTHER THAN ISLAM  SUBMISSION TO GOD  NEVER WILL IT BE ACCEPTED OF HIM  AND IN THE HEREAFTER HE WILL BE IN THE RANKS OF THOSE WHO HAVE LOST  ALL SPIRITUAL GOOD  
   HOW SHALL GOD GUIDE THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH AFTER THEY ACCEPTED IT AND BORE WITNESS THAT THE APOSTLE WAS TRUE AND THAT CLEAR SIGNS HAD COME UNTO THEM  BUT GOD GUIDES NOT A PEOPLE UNJUST 
   OF SUCH THE REWARD IS THAT ON THEM  RESTS  THE CURSE OF GOD OF HIS ANGELS AND OF ALL MANKIND 
   IN THAT WILL THEY DWELL  NOR WILL THEIR PENALTY BE LIGHTENED NOR RESPITE BE THEIR  LOT  
   EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT REPENT  EVEN  AFTER THAT AND MAKE AMENDS  FOR VERILY GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   BUT THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH AFTER THEY ACCEPTED IT AND THEN GO ON ADDING TO THEIR DEFIANCE OF FAITH NEVER WILL THEIR REPENTANCE BE ACCEPTED  FOR THEY ARE THOSE WHO HAVE  OF SET PURPOSE  GONE ASTRAY

   IN IT ARE SIGNS MANIFEST   FOR EXAMPLE  THE STATION OF ABRAHAM  WHOEVER ENTERS IT ATTAINS SECURITY  PILGRIMAGE THERETO IS A DUTY MEN OWE TO GOD THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD THE JOURNEY  BUT IF ANY DENY FAITH GOD STANDS NOT IN NEED OF ANY OF HIS CREATURES 
   SAY   O PEOPLE OF THE BOOK  WHY REJECT YE THE SIGNS OF GOD WHEN GOD IS HIMSELF WITNESS TO ALL YE DO 
   SAY   O YE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK  WHY OBSTRUCT YE THOSE WHO BELIEVE FROM THE PATH OF GOD SEEKING TO MAKE IT CROOKED WHILE YE WERE YOURSELVES WITNESSES  TO GOD S COVENANT   BUT GOD IS NOT UNMINDFUL OF ALL THAT YE DO  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  IF YE LISTEN TO A FACTION AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK THEY WOULD  INDEED  RENDER YOU APOSTATES AFTER YE HAVE BELIEVED 
   AND HOW WOULD YE DENY FAITH WHILE UNTO YOU ARE REHEARSED THE SIGNS OF GOD AND AMONG YOU LIVES THE APOSTLE  WHOEVER HOLDS FIRMLY TO GOD WILL BE SHOWN A WAY THAT IS STRAIGHT SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  FEAR GOD AS HE SHOULD BE FEARED AND DIE NOT EXCEPT IN A STATE OF ISLAM 
   AND HOLD FAST ALL TOGETHER BY THE ROPE WHICH GOD  STRETCHES OUT FOR YOU  AND BE NOT DIVIDED AMONG YOURSELVES  AND REMEMBER WITH GRATITUDE GOD S FAVOR ON YOU  FOR YE WERE ENEMIES AND HE JOINED YOUR HEARTS IN LOVE SO THAT BY HIS GRACE YE BECAME BRETHREN  AND YE WERE ON THE BRINK OF THE PIT OF FIRE AND HE SAVED YOU FROM IT  THUS DOTH GOD MAKE HIS SIGNS CLEAR TO YOU  THAT YE MAY BE GUIDED 
   LET THERE ARISE OUT OF YOU A BAND OF PEOPLE INVITING TO ALL THAT IS GOOD ENJOINING WHAT IS RIGHT AND FORBIDDING WHAT IS WRONG  THEY ARE THE ONES TO ATTAIN FELICITY 
   BE NOT LIKE THOSE WHO ARE DIVIDED AMONGST THEMSELVES AND FALL INTO DISPUTATIONS AFTER RECEIVING CLEAR SIGNS  FOR THEM IS A DREADFUL PENALTY 
   ON THE DAY WHEN SOME FACES WILL BE  LIT UP WITH  WHITE AND SOME FACES WILL BE  IN THE GLOOM OF  BLACK  TO THOSE WHOSE FACES WILL BE BLACK  WILL BE SAID    DID YE REJECT FAITH AFTER ACCEPTING IT  TASTE THEN THE PENALTY FOR REJECTING FAITH 
   BUT THOSE WHOSE FACES WILL BE  LIT WITH  WHITE THEY WILL BE IN  THE LIGHT OF  GOD S MERCY  THEREIN TO DWELL  FOR EVER  
   THESE ARE THE SIGNS OF GOD  WE REHEARSE THEM TO THEE IN TRUTH  AND GOD MEANS NO INJUSTICE TO ANY OF HIS CREATURES 
   TO GOD BELONGS ALL THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  TO HIM DO ALL QUESTIONS GO BACK  FOR DECISION  SECTION  
   YE ARE THE BEST OF PEOPLES EVOLVED FOR MANKIND ENJOINING WHAT IS RIGHT FORBIDDING WHAT IS WRONG AND BELIEVING IN GOD  IF ONLY THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK HAD FAITH IT WERE BEST FOR THEM  AMONG THEM ARE SOME WHO HAVE FAITH BUT MOST OF THEM ARE PERVERTED TRANSGRESSORS 
   THEY WILL DO YOU NO HARM BARRING A TRIFLING ANNOYANCE  IF THEY COME OUT TO FIGHT YOU THEY WILL SHOW YOU THEIR BACKS AND NO HELP SHALL THEY GET 
   SHAME IS PITCHED OVER THEM  LIKE A TENT  WHEREVER THEY ARE FOUND EXCEPT WHEN UNDER A COVENANT  OF PROTECTION  FROM GOD AND FROM MEN  THEY DRAW ON THEMSELVES WRATH FROM GOD AND PITCHED OVER THEM IS  THE TENT OF  DESTITUTION  THIS BECAUSE THEY REJECTED THE SIGNS OF GOD AND SLEW THE PROPHETS IN DEFIANCE OF RIGHT  THIS BECAUSE THEY REBELLED AND TRANSGRESSED BEYOND BOUNDS 
   NOT ALL OF THEM ARE ALIKE  OF THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK ARE A PORTION THAT STAND  FOR THE RIGHT   THEY REHEARSE THE SIGNS OF GOD ALL NIGHT LONG AND THEN PROSTRATE THEMSELVES IN ADORATION 
   THEY BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY  THEY ENJOIN WHAT IS RIGHT AND FORBID WHAT IS WRONG  AND THEY  HASTEN IN EMULATION  IN  ALL  GOOD WORKS  THEY ARE IN THE RANKS OF THE RIGHTEOUS 
   OF THE GOOD THAT THEY DO NOTHING WILL BE REJECTED OF THEM  FOR GOD KNOWETH WELL THOSE THAT DO RIGHT 
   THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH NEITHER THEIR POSSESSIONS NOR THEIR  NUMEROUS  PROGENY WILL AVAIL THEM AUGHT AGAINST GOD  THEY WILL BE COMPANIONS OF THE FIRE DWELLING THEREIN  FOR EVER  
   WHAT THEY SPEND IN THE LIFE OF THIS  MATERIAL  WORLD MAY BE LIKENED TO A WIND WHICH BRINGS A NIPPING FROST  IT STRIKES AND DESTROYS THE HARVEST OF MEN WHO HAVE WRONGED THEIR OWN SOULS  IT IS NOT GOD THAT HATH WRONGED THEM BUT THEY WRONG THEMSELVES 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  TAKE NOT INTO YOUR INTIMACY THOSE OUTSIDE YOUR RANKS  THEY WILL NOT FAIL TO CORRUPT YOU  THEY ONLY DESIRE YOUR RUIN  RANK HATRED HAS ALREADY APPEARED FROM THEIR MOUTHS  WHAT THEIR HEARTS CONCEAL IS FAR WORSE  WE HAVE MADE PLAIN TO YOU THE SIGNS IF YE HAVE WISDOM 
   AH  YE ARE THOSE WHO LOVE THEM BUT THEY LOVE YOU NOT THOUGH YE BELIEVE IN THE WHOLE OF THE BOOK  WHEN THEY MEET YOU THEY SAY  WE BELIEVE   BUT WHEN THEY ARE ALONE THEY BITE OFF THE VERY TIPS OF THEIR FINGERS AT YOU IN THEIR RAGE  SAY   PERISH IN YOUR RAGE  GOD KNOWETH WELL ALL THE SECRETS OF THE HEART  
   IF AUGHT THAT IS GOOD BEFALLS YOU IT GRIEVES THEM  BUT IF SOME MISFORTUNE OVERTAKES YOU THEY REJOICE AT IT  BUT IF YE ARE CONSTANT AND DO RIGHT NOT THE LEAST HARM WILL THEIR CUNNING DO TO YOU FOR GOD COMPASSETH ROUND ABOUT ALL THAT THEY DO SECTION  
   REMEMBER THAT MORNING THOU DIDST LEAVE THE HOUSEHOLD  EARLY  TO POST THE FAITHFUL AT THEIR STATIONS FOR BATTLE  AND GOD HEARETH AND KNOWETH ALL THINGS 
   REMEMBER TWO OF YOUR PARTIES MEDITATED COWARDICE  BUT GOD WAS THEIR PROTECTOR AND IN GOD SHOULD THE FAITHFUL  EVER  PUT THEIR TRUST 
   GOD HAD HELPED YOU AT BADR WHEN YE WERE A CONTEMPTIBLE LITTLE FORCE  THEN FEAR GOD  THUS MAY YE SHOW YOUR GRATITUDE 
   REMEMBER THOU SAIDST TO THE FAITHFUL   IS IT NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU THAT GOD SHOULD HELP YOU WITH THREE THOUSAND ANGELS  SPECIALLY  SENT DOWN 
    YEA  IF YE REMAIN FIRM AND ACT ARIGHT EVEN IF THE ENEMY SHOULD RUSH HERE ON YOU IN HOT HASTE  YOUR LORD WOULD HELP YOU WITH FIVE THOUSAND ANGELS MAKING A TERRIFIC ONSLAUGHT 
   GOD MADE IT BUT A MESSAGE OF HOPE FOR YOU  AND AN ASSURANCE TO YOUR HEARTS   IN ANY CASE  THERE IS NO HELP EXCEPT FROM GOD THE EXALTED THE WISE 
   THAT HE MIGHT CUT OFF A FRINGE OF THE UNBELIEVERS OR EXPOSE THEM TO INFAMY AND THEY SHOULD THEN BE TURNED BACK FRUSTRATED OF THEIR PURPOSE 
   NOT FOR THEE  BUT FOR GOD  IS THE DECISION  WHETHER HE TURN IN MERCY TO THEM OR PUNISH THEM  FOR THEY ARE INDEED WRONG DOERS 
   TO GOD BELONGETH ALL THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  HE FORGIVETH WHOM HE PLEASETH AND PUNISHETH WHOM HE PLEASETH  BUT GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  DEVOUR NOT USURY DOUBLED AND MULTIPLIED  BUT FEAR GOD  THAT YE MAY  REALLY  PROSPER 
   FEAR THE FIRE WHICH IS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH 
   AND OBEY GOD AND THE APOSTLE  THAT YE MAY OBTAIN MERCY 
   BE QUICK IN THE RACE FOR FORGIVENESS FROM YOUR LORD AND FOR A GARDEN WHOSE WIDTH IS THAT  OF THE WHOLE  OF THE HEAVENS AND OF THE EARTH PREPARED FOR THE RIGHTEOUS 
   THOSE WHO SPEND  FREELY  WHETHER IN PROSPERITY OR IN ADVERSITY  WHO RESTRAIN ANGER AND PARDON  ALL  MEN  FOR GOD LOVES THOSE WHO DO GOOD 
   AND THOSE WHO HAVING DONE SOMETHING TO BE ASHAMED OF OR WRONGED THEIR OWN SOULS EARNESTLY BRING GOD TO MIND AND ASK FOR FORGIVENESS FOR THEIR SINS AND WHO CAN FORGIVE SINS EXCEPT GOD  AND ARE NEVER OBSTINATE IN PERSISTING KNOWINGLY IN  THE WRONG  THEY HAVE DONE 
   FOR SUCH THE REWARD IS FORGIVENESS FROM THEIR LORD AND GARDENS WITH RIVERS FLOWING UNDERNEATH AN ETERNAL DWELLING  HOW EXCELLENT A RECOMPENSE FOR THOSE WHO WORK  AND STRIVE   
   MANY WERE THE WAYS OF LIFE THAT HAVE PASSED AWAY BEFORE YOU  TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH AND SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE WHO REJECTED TRUTH 
   HERE IS A PLAIN STATEMENT TO MEN A GUIDANCE AND INSTRUCTION TO THOSE WHO FEAR GOD  
   SO LOSE NOT HEART NOR FALL INTO DESPAIR  FOR YE MUST GAIN MASTERY IF YE ARE TRUE IN FAITH 
   IF A WOUND HATH TOUCHED YOU BE SURE A SIMILAR WOUND HATH TOUCHED THE OTHERS  SUCH DAYS  OF VARYING FORTUNES  WE GIVE TO MEN AND MEN BY TURNS  THAT GOD MAY KNOW THOSE THAT BELIEVE AND THAT HE MAY TAKE TO HIMSELF FROM YOUR RANKS MARTYR WITNESSES  TO TRUTH   AND GOD LOVETH NOT THOSE THAT DO WRONG 
   GOD S OBJECT ALSO IS TO PURGE THOSE THAT ARE TRUE IN FAITH AND TO DEPRIVE OF BLESSING THOSE THAT RESIST FAITH 
   DID YE THINK THAT YE WOULD ENTER HEAVEN WITHOUT GOD TESTING THOSE OF YOU WHO FOUGHT HARD  IN HIS CAUSE  AND REMAINED STEADFAST  
   YE DID INDEED WISH FOR DEATH BEFORE YE MET HIM  NOW YE HAVE SEEN HIM WITH YOUR OWN EYES  AND YE FLINCH   SECTION  
   MUHAMMAD IS NO MORE THAN AN APOSTLE  MANY WERE THE APOSTLES THAT PASSED AWAY BEFORE HIM  IF HE DIED OR WERE SLAIN WILL YE THEN TURN BACK ON YOUR HEELS  IF ANY DID TURN BACK ON HIS HEELS NOT THE LEAST HARM WILL HE DO TO GOD  BUT GOD  ON THE OTHER HAND  WILL SWIFTLY REWARD THOSE WHO  SERVE HIM  WITH GRATITUDE 
   NOR CAN A SOUL DIE EXCEPT BY GOD S LEAVE THE TERM BEING FIXED AS BY WRITING  IF ANY DO DESIRE A REWARD IN THIS LIFE WE SHALL GIVE IT TO HIM  AND IF ANY DO DESIRE A REWARD IN THE HEREAFTER WE SHALL GIVE IT TO HIM  AND SWIFTLY SHALL WE REWARD THOSE THAT  SERVE US WITH  GRATITUDE 
   HOW MANY OF THE PROPHETS FOUGHT  IN GOD S WAY  AND WITH THEM  FOUGHT  LARGE BANDS OF GODLY MEN  BUT THEY NEVER LOST HEART IF THEY MET WITH DISASTER IN GOD S WAY NOR DID THEY WEAKEN  IN WILL  NOR GIVE IN  AND GOD LOVES THOSE WHO ARE FIRM AND STEADFAST 
   ALL THAT THEY SAID WAS   OUR LORD  FORGIVE US OUR SINS AND ANYTHING WE MAY HAVE DONE THAT TRANSGRESSED OUR DUTY  ESTABLISH OUR FEET FIRMLY AND HELP US AGAINST THOSE THAT RESIST FAITH  
   AND GOD GAVE THEM A REWARD IN THIS WORLD AND THE EXCELLENT REWARD OF THE HEREAFTER  FOR GOD LOVETH THOSE WHO DO GOOD SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  IF YE OBEY THE UNBELIEVERS THEY WILL DRIVE YOU BACK ON YOUR HEELS AND YE WILL TURN BACK  FROM FAITH  TO YOUR OWN LOSS 
   NAY  GOD IS YOUR PROTECTOR AND HE IS THE BEST OF HELPERS 
   SOON SHALL WE CAST TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF THE UNBELIEVERS FOR THAT THEY JOINED COMPANIONS WITH GOD FOR WHICH HE HAD SENT NO AUTHORITY  THEIR ABODE WILL BE THE FIRE  AND EVIL IS THE HOME OF THE WRONG  DOERS  
   GOD DID INDEED FULFIL HIS PROMISE TO YOU WHEN YE WITH HIS PERMISSION WERE ABOUT TO ANNIHILATE YOUR ENEMY UNTIL YE FLINCHED AND FELL TO DISPUTING ABOUT THE ORDER AND DISOBEYED IT AFTER HE BROUGHT YOU IN SIGHT  OF THE BOOTY  WHICH YE COVET  AMONG YOU ARE SOME THAT HANKER AFTER THIS WORLD AND SOME THAT DESIRE THE HEREAFTER  THEN DID HE DIVERT YOU FROM YOUR FOES IN ORDER TO TEST YOU BUT HE FORGAVE YOU  FOR GOD IS FULL OF GRACE TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE 
   BEHOLD  YE WERE CLIMBING UP THE HIGH GROUND WITHOUT EVEN CASTING A SIDE GLANCE AT ANYONE AND THE APOSTLE IN YOUR REAR WAS CALLING YOU BACK  THERE DID GOD GIVE YOU ONE DISTRESS AFTER ANOTHER BY WAY OF REQUITAL TO TEACH YOU NOT TO GRIEVE FOR  THE BOOTY  THAT HAD ESCAPED YOU AND FOR  THE ILL  THAT HAD BEFALLEN YOU  FOR GOD IS WELL AWARE OF ALL THAT YE DO 
   AFTER  THE EXCITEMENT  OF THE DISTRESS HE SENT DOWN CALM ON A BAND OF YOU OVERCOME WITH SLUMBER WHILE ANOTHER BAND WAS STIRRED TO ANXIETY BY THEIR OWN FEELINGS MOVED BY WRONG SUSPICIONS OF GOD SUSPICIONS DUE TO IGNORANCE  THEY SAID   WHAT AFFAIR IS THIS OF OURS   SAY THOU   INDEED THIS AFFAIR IS WHOLLY GOD S   THEY HIDE IN THEIR MINDS WHAT THEY DARE NOT REVEAL TO THEE  THEY SAY  TO THEMSELVES    IF WE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS AFFAIR WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE SLAUGHTER HERE   SAY   EVEN IF YOU HAD REMAINED IN YOUR HOMES THOSE FOR WHOM DEATH WAS DECREED WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE GONE FORTH TO THE PLACE OF THEIR DEATH   BUT  ALL THIS WAS  THAT GOD MIGHT TEST WHAT IS IN YOUR BREASTS AND PURGE WHAT IS IN YOUR HEARTS  FOR GOD KNOWETH WELL THE SECRETS OF YOUR HEARTS 
   THOSE OF YOU WHO TURNED BACK ON THE DAY THE TWO HOSTS MET IT WAS SATAN WHO CAUSED THEM TO FAIL BECAUSE OF SOME  EVIL  THEY HAD DONE  BUT GOD HAS BLOTTED OUT  THEIR FAULT   FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST FORBEARING SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  BE NOT LIKE THE UNBELIEVERS WHO SAY OF THEIR BRETHREN WHEN THEY ARE TRAVELLING THROUGH THE EARTH OR ENGAGED IN FIGHTING   IF THEY HAD STAYED WITH US THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DIED OR BEEN SLAIN  THIS THAT GOD MAY MAKE IT A CAUSE OF SIGHS AND REGRETS IN THEIR HEARTS  IT IS GOD THAT GIVES LIFE AND DEATH AND GOD SEES WELL ALL THAT YE DO 
   AND IF YE ARE SLAIN OR DIE IN THE WAY OF GOD FORGIVENESS AND MERCY FROM GOD ARE FAR BETTER THAN ALL THEY COULD AMASS 
   AND IF YE DIE OR ARE SLAIN LO  IT IS UNTO GOD THAT YE ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER 
   IT IS PART OF THE MERCY OF GOD THAT THOU DOST DEAL GENTLY WITH THEM  WERT THOU SEVERE OR HARSH HEARTED THEY WOULD HAVE BROKEN AWAY FROM ABOUT THEE  SO PASS OVER  THEIR FAULTS  AND ASK FOR  GOD S  FORGIVENESS FOR THEM  AND CONSULT THEM IN AFFAIRS  OF MOMENT   THEN WHEN THOU HAST TAKEN A DECISION PUT THY TRUST IN GOD  FOR GOD LOVES THOSE WHO PUT THEIR TRUST  IN HIM  
   IF GOD HELPS YOU NONE CAN OVERCOME YOU  IF HE FORSAKES YOU WHO IS THERE AFTER THAT THAT CAN HELP YOU  IN GOD THEN LET BELIEVERS PUT THEIR TRUST 
   NO PROPHET COULD  EVER  BE FALSE TO HIS TRUST  IF ANY PERSON IS SO FALSE HE SHALL ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT RESTORE WHAT HE MISAPPROPRIATED  THEN SHALL EVERY SOUL RECEIVE ITS DUE WHATEVER IT EARNED AND NONE SHALL BE DEALT WITH UNJUSTLY 
   IS THE MAN WHO FOLLOWS THE GOOD PLEASURE OF GOD LIKE THE MAN WHO DRAWS ON HIMSELF THE WRATH OF GOD AND WHOSE ABODE IS IN HELL  A WOEFUL REFUGE  
   THEY ARE IN VARYING GRADES IN THE SIGHT OF GOD  AND GOD SEES WELL ALL THAT THEY DO 
   GOD DID CONFER A GREAT FAVOR ON THE BELIEVERS WHEN HE SENT AMONG THEM AN APOSTLE FROM AMONG THEMSELVES REHEARSING UNTO THEM THE SIGNS OF GOD SANCTIFYING THEM AND INSTRUCTING THEM IN SCRIPTURE AND WISDOM WHILE BEFORE THAT THEY HAD BEEN IN MANIFEST ERROR 
   WHAT  WHEN A SINGLE DISASTER SMITES YOU ALTHOUGH YE SMOTE  YOUR ENEMIES  WITH ONE TWICE AS GREAT DO YE SAY   WHENCE IS THIS   SAY  TO THEM    IT IS FROM YOURSELVES  FOR GOD HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   WHAT YE SUFFERED ON THE DAY THE TWO ARMIES MET WAS WITH THE LEAVE OF GOD IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT TEST THE BELIEVERS 
   AND THE HYPOCRITES ALSO  THESE WERE TOLD   COME FIGHT IN THE WAY OF GOD OR  AT LEAST  DRIVE  THE FOE FROM YOUR CITY    THEY SAY   HAD WE KNOWN HOW TO FIGHT WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FOLLOWED YOU  THEY WERE THAT DAY NEARER TO UNBELIEF THAN TO FAITH SAYING WITH THEIR LIPS WHAT WAS NOT IN THEIR HEARTS  BUT GOD HATH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THEY CONCEAL 
    THEY ARE  THE ONES THAT SAY  OF THEIR BRETHREN SLAIN  WHILE THEY THEMSELVES SIT  AT EASE    IF ONLY THEY HAD LISTENED TO US THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SLAIN   SAY   AVERT DEATH FROM YOUR OWN SELVES IF YE SPEAK THE TRUTH  
   THINK NOT OF THOSE WHO ARE SLAIN IN GOD S WAY AS DEAD  NAY THEY LIVE FINDING THEIR SUSTENANCE IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR LORD 
   THEY REJOICE IN THE BOUNTY PROVIDED BY GOD  AND WITH REGARD TO THOSE LEFT BEHIND WHO HAVE NOT YET JOINED THEM  IN THEIR BLISS  THE  MARTYRS  GLORY IN THE FACT THAT ON THEM IS NO FEAR NOR HAVE THEY  CAUSE TO  GRIEVE 
   THEY GLORY IN THE GRACE AND THE BOUNTY FROM GOD AND IN THE FACT THAT GOD SUFFERETH NOT THE REWARD OF THE FAITHFUL TO BE LOST  IN THE LEAST  SECTION  
   OF THOSE WHO ANSWERED THE CALL OF GOD AND THE APOSTLE EVEN AFTER BEING WOUNDED THOSE WHO DO RIGHT AND REFRAIN FROM WRONG HAVE A GREAT REWARD 
   MEN SAID TO THEM   A GREAT ARMY IS GATHERING AGAINST YOU   AND FRIGHTENED THEM  BUT IT  ONLY  INCREASED THEIR FAITH  THEY SAID   FOR US GOD SUFFICETH AND HE IS THE BEST DISPOSER OF AFFAIRS
   AND THEY RETURNED WITH GRACE AND BOUNTY FROM GOD  NO HARM EVER TOUCHED THEM  FOR THEY FOLLOWED THE GOOD PLEASURE OF GOD  AND GOD IS THE LORD OF BOUNTIES UNBOUNDED 
   IT IS ONLY THE EVIL ONE THAT SUGGESTS TO YOU THE FEAR OF HIS VOTARIES  BE YE NOT AFRAID OF THEM BUT FEAR ME IF YE HAVE FAITH 
   LET NOT THOSE GRIEVE THEE WHO RUSH HEADLONG INTO UNBELIEF  NOT THE LEAST HARM WILL THEY DO TO GOD  GOD S PLAN IS THAT HE WILL GIVE THEM NO PORTION IN THE HEREAFTER BUT A SEVERE PUNISHMENT 
   THOSE WHO PURCHASE UNBELIEF AT THE PRICE OF FAITH NOT THE LEAST HARM WILL THEY DO TO GOD BUT THEY WILL HAVE A GRIEVOUS PUNISHMENT 
   LET NOT THE UNBELIEVERS THINK THAT OUR RESPITE TO THEM IS GOOD FOR THEMSELVES  WE GRANT THEM RESPITE THAT THEY MAY GROW IN THEIR INIQUITY  BUT THEY WILL HAVE A SHAMEFUL PUNISHMENT 
   ALLAH WILL NOT LEAVE THE BELIEVERS IN THE STATE IN WHICH YE ARE NOW UNTIL HE SEPARATES WHAT IS EVIL FROM WHAT IS GOOD  NOR WILL HE DISCLOSE TO YOU THE SECRETS OF THE UNSEEN  BUT HE CHOOSES OF HIS APOSTLES  FOR THE PURPOSE  WHOM HE PLEASES  SO BELIEVE IN GOD AND HIS APOSTLES  AND IF YE BELIEVE AND DO RIGHT YE HAVE A REWARD WITHOUT MEASURE 
   AND LET NOT THOSE WHO COVETOUSLY WITHHOLD OF THE GIFTS WHICH GOD HATH GIVEN THEM OF HIS GRACE THINK THAT IT IS GOOD FOR THEM  NAY IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR THEM  SOON SHALL THE THINGS WHICH THEY COVETOUSLY WITHHELD BE TIED TO THEIR NECKS LIKE A TWISTED COLLAR ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  TO GOD BELONGS THE HERITAGE OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THAT YE DO SECTION  
   ALLAH HATH HEARD THE TAUNT OF THOSE WHO SAY   TRULY GOD IS INDIGENT AND WE ARE RICH    WE SHALL CERTAINLY RECORD THEIR WORD AND  THEIR ACT  OF SLAYING THE PROPHETS IN DEFIANCE OF RIGHT AND WE SHALL SAY   TASTE YE THE PENALTY OF THE SCORCHING FIRE  
    THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE  UNRIGHTEOUS DEEDS  WHICH YOUR HANDS SENT ON BEFORE YE  FOR GOD NEVER HARMS THOSE WHO SERVE HIM  
   THEY  ALSO  SAID   GOD TOOK OUR PROMISE NOT TO BELIEVE IN AN APOSTLE UNLESS HE SHOWED US A SACRIFICE CONSUMED BY FIRE  FROM HEAVEN    SAY   THERE CAME TO YOU APOSTLES BEFORE ME WITH CLEAR SIGNS AND EVEN WITH WHAT YE ASK FOR  WHY THEN DID YE SLAY THEM IF YE SPEAK THE TRUTH  
   THEN IF THEY REJECT THEE SO WERE REJECTED APOSTLES BEFORE THEE WHO CAME WITH CLEAR SIGNS BOOKS OF DARK PROPHECIES AND THE BOOK OF ENLIGHTENMENT 
   EVERY SOUL SHALL HAVE A TASTE OF DEATH  AND ONLY ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT SHALL YOU BE PAID YOUR FULL RECOMPENSE  ONLY HE WHO IS SAVED FAR FROM THE FIRE AND ADMITTED TO THE GARDEN WILL HAVE ATTAINED THE OBJECT  OF LIFE   FOR THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD IS BUT GOODS AND CHATTELS OF DECEPTION 
   YE SHALL CERTAINLY BE TRIED AND TESTED IN YOUR POSSESSIONS AND IN YOUR PERSONAL SELVES  AND YE SHALL CERTAINLY HEAR MUCH THAT WILL GRIEVE YOU FROM THOSE WHO RECEIVED THE BOOK BEFORE YOU AND FROM THOSE WHO WORSHIP MANY GODS  BUT IF YE PERSEVERE PATIENTLY AND GUARD AGAINST EVIL THEN THAT WILL BE A DETERMINING FACTOR IN ALL AFFAIRS 
   AND REMEMBER GOD TOOK A COVENANT FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK TO MAKE IT KNOWN AND CLEAR TO MANKIND AND NOT TO HIDE IT  BUT THEY THREW IT AWAY BEHIND THEIR BACKS AND PURCHASED WITH IT SOME MISERABLE GAIN  AND VILE WAS THE BARGAIN THEY MADE 
   THINK NOT THAT THOSE WHO EXULT IN WHAT THEY HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT AND LOVE TO BE PRAISED FOR WHAT THEY HAVE NOT DONE THINK NOT THAT THEY CAN ESCAPE THE PENALTY  FOR THEM IS A PENALTY GRIEVOUS INDEED 
   TO GOD BELONGETH THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND GOD HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS SECTION  
   BEHOLD  IN THE CREATION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND THE ALTERNATION OF NIGHT AND DAY THERE ARE INDEED SIGNS FOR MEN OF UNDERSTANDING 
   MEN WHO CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF GOD STANDING SITTING AND LYING DOWN ON THEIR SIDES AND CONTEMPLATE THE  WONDERS OF  CREATION IN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  WITH THE THOUGHT    OUR LORD  NOT FOR NAUGHT HAST THOU CREATED  ALL  THIS  GLORY TO THEE  GIVE US SALVATION FROM THE PENALTY OF THE FIRE 
    OUR LORD  ANY WHOM THOU DOST ADMIT TO THE FIRE TRULY THOU COVEREST WITH SHAME AND NEVER WILL WRONG DOERS FIND ANY HELPERS  
    OUR LORD  WE HAVE HEARD THE CALL OF ONE CALLING  US  TO FAITH  BELIEVE YE IN THE LORD  AND WE HAVE BELIEVED  OUR LORD  FORGIVE US OUR SINS BLOT OUT FROM US OUR INIQUITIES AND TAKE TO THYSELF OUR SOULS IN THE COMPANY OF THE RIGHTEOUS 
    OUR LORD  GRANT US WHAT THOU DIDST PROMISE UNTO US THROUGH THINE APOSTLES AND SAVE US FROM SHAME ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  FOR THOU NEVER BREAKEST THY PROMISE  
   AND THEIR LORD HATH ACCEPTED OF THEM AND ANSWERED THEM   NEVER WILL I SUFFER TO BE LOST THE WORK OF ANY OF YOU BE HE MALE OR FEMALE  YE ARE MEMBERS ONE OF ANOTHER  THOSE WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR HOMES OR BEEN DRIVEN OUT THEREFROM OR SUFFERED HARM IN MY CAUSE OR FOUGHT OR BEEN SLAIN VERILY I WILL BLOT OUT FROM THEM THEIR INIQUITIES AND ADMIT THEM INTO GARDENS WITH RIVERS FLOWING BENEATH  A REWARD FROM THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND FROM HIS PRESENCE IS THE BEST OF REWARDS  
   LET NOT THE STRUTTING ABOUT OF THE UNBELIEVERS THROUGH THE LAND DECEIVE THEE 
   LITTLE IS IT FOR ENJOYMENT  THEIR ULTIMATE ABODE IS HELL  WHAT AN EVIL BED  TO LIE ON   
   ON THE OTHER HAND FOR THOSE WHO FEAR THEIR LORD ARE GARDENS WITH RIVERS FLOWING BENEATH THEREIN ARE THEY TO DWELL  FOR EVER  A GIFT FROM THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND THAT WHICH IS IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD IS THE BEST  BLISS  FOR THE RIGHTEOUS 
   AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN GOD IN THE REVELATION TO YOU AND IN THE REVELATION TO THEM BOWING IN HUMILITY TO GOD  THEY WILL NOT SELL THE SIGNS OF GOD FOR A MISERABLE GAIN  FOR THEM IS A REWARD WITH THEIR LORD AND GOD IS SWIFT IN ACCOUNT

   TO ORPHANS RESTORE THEIR PROPERTY  WHEN THEY REACH THEIR AGE  NOR SUBSTITUTE  YOUR  WORTHLESS THINGS FOR  THEIR  GOOD ONES  AND DEVOUR NOT THEIR SUBSTANCE  BY MIXING IT UP  WITH YOUR OWN  FOR THIS IS INDEED A GREAT SIN 
   IF YE FEAR THAT YE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO DEAL JUSTLY WITH THE ORPHANS MARRY WOMEN OF YOUR CHOICE TWO OR THREE OR FOUR  BUT IF YE FEAR THAT YE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO DEAL JUSTLY  WITH THEM  THEN ONLY ONE OR  A CAPTIVE  THAT YOUR RIGHT HANDS POSSESS  THAT WILL BE MORE SUITABLE TO PREVENT YOU FROM DOING INJUSTICE 
   AND GIVE THE WOMEN  ON MARRIAGE  THEIR DOWER AS A FREE GIFT  BUT IF THEY OF THEIR OWN GOOD PLEASURE REMIT ANY PART OF IT TO YOU TAKE IT AND ENJOY IT WITH RIGHT GOOD CHEER 
   TO THOSE WEAK OF UNDERSTANDING MAKE NOT OVER YOUR PROPERTY WHICH GOD HATH MADE A MEANS OF SUPPORT FOR YOU BUT FEED AND CLOTHE THEM THEREWITH AND SPEAK TO THEM WORDS OF KINDNESS AND JUSTICE 
   MAKE TRIAL OF ORPHANS UNTIL THEY REACH THE AGE OF MARRIAGE  IF THEN YE FIND SOUND JUDGMENT IN THEM RELEASE THEIR PROPERTY TO THEM  BUT CONSUME IT NOT WASTEFULLY NOR IN HASTE AGAINST THEIR GROWING UP  IF THE GUARDIAN IS WELL OFF LET HIM CLAIM NO REMUNERATION BUT IF HE IS POOR LET HIM HAVE FOR HIMSELF WHAT IS JUST AND REASONABLE  WHEN YE RELEASE THEIR PROPERTY TO THEM TAKE WITNESSES IN THEIR PRESENCE  BUT ALL SUFFICIENT IS GOD IN TAKING ACCOUNT 
   FROM WHAT IS LEFT BY PARENTS AND THOSE NEAREST RELATED THERE IS A SHARE FOR MEN AND A SHARE FOR WOMEN WHETHER THE PROPERTY BE SMALL OR LARGE A DETERMINATE SHARE 
   BUT IF AT THE TIME OF DIVISION OTHER RELATIVES OF ORPHANS OR POOR ARE PRESENT FEED THEM OUT OF THE  PROPERTY  AND SPEAK TO THEM WORDS OF KINDNESS AND JUSTICE 
   LET THOSE  DISPOSING OF AN ESTATE  HAVE THE SAME FEAR IN THEIR MINDS AS THEY WOULD HAVE FOR THEIR OWN IF THEY HAD LEFT A HELPLESS FAMILY BEHIND  LET THEM FEAR GOD AND SPEAK WORDS OF APPROPRIATE  COMFORT  
   THOSE WHO UNJUSTLY EAT UP THE PROPERTY OF ORPHANS EAT UP A FIRE INTO THEIR OWN BODIES  THEY WILL SOON BE ENDURING A BLAZING FIRE SECTION

   AND IN NO WISE COVET THOSE THINGS IN WHICH GOD HATH BESTOWED HIS GIFTS MORE FREELY ON SOME OF YOU THAN ON OTHERS  TO MEN IS ALLOTTED WHAT THEY EARN AND TO WOMEN WHAT THEY EARN  BUT ASK GOD OF HIS BOUNTY  FOR GOD HATH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THINGS 
   TO  BENEFIT  EVERYONE WE HAVE APPOINTED SHARERS AND HEIRS TO PROPERTY LEFT BY PARENTS AND RELATIVES  TO THOSE ALSO TO WHOM YOUR RIGHT HAND WAS PLEDGED GIVE THEIR DUE PORTION  FOR TRULY GOD IS WITNESS TO ALL THINGS SECTION  
   MEN ARE THE PROTECTORS AND MAINTAINERS OF WOMEN BECAUSE GOD HAS GIVEN THE ONE MORE  STRENGTH  THAN THE OTHER AND BECAUSE THEY SUPPORT THEM FROM THEIR MEANS  THEREFORE THE RIGHTEOUS WOMEN ARE DEVOUTLY OBEDIENT AND GUARD IN  THE HUSBAND S  ABSENCE WHAT GOD WOULD HAVE THEM GUARD  AS TO THOSE WOMEN ON WHOSE PART YE FEAR DISLOYALTY AND ILL CONDUCT ADMONISH THEM  FIRST   NEXT  REFUSE TO SHARE THEIR BEDS  AND LAST  BEAT THEM  LIGHTLY   BUT IF THEY RETURN TO OBEDIENCE SEEK NOT AGAINST THEM MEANS  OF ANNOYANCE   FOR GOD IS MOST HIGH GREAT  ABOVE YOU ALL

    NOR  THOSE WHO SPEND OF THEIR SUBSTANCE TO BE SEEN OF MEN BUT HAVE NO FAITH IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY  IF ANY TAKE THE EVIL ONE FOR THEIR INTIMATE WHAT A DREADFUL INTIMATE HE IS  
   AND WHAT BURDEN WERE IT ON THEM IF THEY HAD FAITH IN GOD AND IN THE LAST DAY AND THEY SPENT OUT OF WHAT GOD HATH GIVEN THEM FOR SUSTENANCE  FOR GOD HATH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THEM 
   GOD IS NEVER UNJUST IN THE LEAST DEGREE  IF THERE IS ANY GOOD  DONE  HE DOUBLETH IT AND GIVETH FROM HIS OWN PRESENCE A GREAT REWARD 
   HOW THEN IF WE BROUGHT FROM EACH PEOPLE A WITNESS AND WE BROUGHT THEE AS A WITNESS AGAINST THESE PEOPLE  
   ON THAT DAY THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH AND DISOBEY THE APOSTLE WILL WISH THAT THE EARTH WERE MADE ONE WITH THEM  BUT NEVER WILL THEY HIDE A SINGLE FACT FROM GOD  SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  APPROACH NOT PRAYERS WITH A MIND BEFOGGED UNTIL YE CAN UNDERSTAND ALL THAT YE SAY NOR IN A STATE OF CEREMONIAL IMPURITY  EXCEPT WHEN TRAVELLING ON THE ROAD  UNTIL AFTER WASHING YOUR WHOLE BODY IF YE ARE ILL OR ON A JOURNEY OR ONE OF YOU COMETH FROM OFFICES OF NATURE OR YE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH WOMEN AND YE FIND NO WATER THEN TAKE FOR YOURSELVES CLEAN SAND OR EARTH AND RUB THEREWITH YOUR FACES AND HANDS  FOR GOD DOTH BLOT OUT SINS AND FORGIVE AGAIN AND AGAIN 
   HAST THOU NOT TURNED THY VISION TO THOSE WHO WERE GIVEN A PORTION OF THE BOOK  THEY TRAFFIC IN ERROR AND WISH THAT YE SHOULD LOSE THE RIGHT PATH 
   BUT GOD HATH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR ENEMIES  GOD IS ENOUGH FOR A PROTECTOR AND GOD IS ENOUGH FOR A HELPER 
   OF THE JEWS THERE ARE THOSE WHO DISPLACE WORDS FROM THEIR  RIGHT  PLACES AND SAY   WE HEAR AND WE DISOBEY   AND  HEAR WHAT IS NOT HEARD   AND  RA INA   WITH A TWIST OF THEIR TONGUES AND A SLANDER TO FAITH  IF ONLY THEY HAD SAID   WE HEAR AND WE OBEY   AND  DO HEAR   AND  DO LOOK AT US   IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THEM AND MORE PROPER  BUT GOD HATH CURSED THEM FOR THEIR UNBELIEF  AND BUT FEW OF THEM WILL BELIEVE 
   O YE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK  BELIEVE IN WHAT WE HAVE  NOW  REVEALED CONFIRMING WHAT WAS  ALREADY  WITH YOU BEFORE WE CHANGE THE FACE AND FAME OF SOME  OF YOU  BEYOND ALL RECOGNITION AND TURN THEM HINDWARDS OR CURSE THEM AS WE CURSED THE SABBATH BREAKERS  FOR THE DECISION OF GOD MUST BE CARRIED OUT 
   GOD FORGIVETH NOT THAT PARTNERS SHOULD BE SET UP WITH HIM  BUT HE FORGIVETH ANYTHING ELSE TO WHOM HE PLEASETH  TO SET UP PARTNERS WITH GOD IS TO DEVISE A SIN MOST HEINOUS INDEED 
   HAST THOU NOT TURNED THY VISION TO THOSE WHO CLAIM SANCTITY FOR THEMSELVES  NAY BUT GOD DOTH SANCTIFY WHOM HE PLEASETH BUT NEVER WILL THEY FAIL TO RECEIVE JUSTICE IN THE LEAST LITTLE THING 
   BEHOLD  HOW THEY INVENT A LIE AGAINST GOD  BUT THAT BY ITSELF IS A MANIFEST SIN  SECTION  
   HAST THOU NOT TURNED THY VISION TO THOSE WHO WERE GIVEN A PORTION OF THE BOOK  THEY BELIEVE IN SORCERY AND EVIL AND SAY TO THE UNBELIEVERS THAT THEY ARE BETTER GUIDED IN THE  RIGHT  WAY THAN THE BELIEVERS  
   THEY ARE  MEN  WHOM GOD HATH CURSED  AND THOSE WHOM GOD HATH CURSED THOU WILT FIND HAVE NO ONE TO HELP 
   HAVE THEY A SHARE IN DOMINION OR POWER  BEHOLD THEY GIVE NOT A FARTHING TO THEIR FELLOW MEN  
   OR DO THEY ENVY MANKIND FOR WHAT GOD HATH GIVEN THEM OF HIS BOUNTY  BUT WE HAD ALREADY GIVEN THE PEOPLE OF ABRAHAM THE BOOK AND WISDOM AND CONFERRED UPON THEM A GREAT KINGDOM 
   SOME OF THEM BELIEVED AND SOME OF THEM AVERTED THEIR FACES FROM HIM  AND ENOUGH IS HELL FOR A BURNING FIRE 
   THOSE WHO REJECT OUR SIGNS WE SHALL SOON CAST INTO THE FIRE  AS OFTEN AS THEIR SKINS ARE ROASTED THROUGH WE SHALL CHANGE THEM FOR FRESH SKINS THAT THEY MAY TASTE THE PENALTY  FOR GOD IS EXALTED IN POWER WISE 
   BUT THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND DO DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WE SHALL SOON ADMIT TO GARDENS WITH RIVERS FLOWING BENEATH THEIR ETERNAL HOME  THEREIN SHALL THEY HAVE COMPANIONS PURE AND HOLY  WE SHALL ADMIT THEM TO SHADES COOL AND EVER DEEPENING 
   ALLAH DOTH COMMAND YOU TO RENDER BACK YOUR TRUSTS TO THOSE TO WHOM THEY ARE DUE  AND WHEN YE JUDGE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN THAT YE JUDGE WITH JUSTICE  VERILY HOW EXCELLENT IS THE TEACHING WHICH HE GIVETH YOU  FOR GOD IS HE WHO HEARETH AND SEETH ALL THINGS 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  OBEY GOD AND OBEY THE APOSTLE AND THOSE CHARGED WITH AUTHORITY AMONG YOU  IF YE DIFFER IN ANYTHING AMONG YOURSELVES REFER IT TO GOD AND HIS APOSTLE IF YE DO BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY  THAT IS BEST AND MOST SUITABLE FOR FINAL DETERMINATION SECTION  
   HAST THOU NOT TURNED THY VISION TO THOSE WHO DECLARE THAT THEY BELIEVE IN THE REVELATIONS THAT HAVE COME TO THEE AND TO THOSE BEFORE THEE  THEIR  REAL  WISH IS TO RESORT TOGETHER FOR JUDGMENT  IN THEIR DISPUTES  TO THE EVIL ONE THOUGH THEY WERE ORDERED TO REJECT HIM  BUT SATAN S WISH IS TO LEAD THEM ASTRAY FAR AWAY  FROM THE RIGHT  
   WHEN IT IS SAID TO THEM   COME TO WHAT GOD HATH REVEALED AND TO THE APOSTLE   THOU SEEST THE HYPOCRITES AVERT THEIR FACES FROM THEE IN DISGUST 
   HOW THEN WHEN THEY ARE SEIZED BY MISFORTUNE BECAUSE OF THE DEEDS WHICH THEIR HANDS HAVE SENT FORTH  THEN THEY COME TO THEE SWEARING BY GOD   WE MEANT NO MORE THAN GOOD WILL AND CONCILIATION   
   THOSE MEN GOD KNOWS WHAT IS IN THEIR HEARTS  SO KEEP CLEAR OF THEM BUT ADMONISH THEM AND SPEAK TO THEM A WORD TO REACH THEIR VERY SOULS 
   WE SENT NOT AN APOSTLE BUT TO BE OBEYED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WILL OF GOD  IF THEY HAD ONLY WHEN THEY WERE UNJUST TO THEMSELVES COME UNTO THEE AND ASKED GOD S FORGIVENESS AND THE APOSTLE HAD ASKED FORGIVENESS FOR THEM THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND GOD INDEED OFT RETURNING MOST MERCIFUL 
   BUT NO BY THY LORD THEY CAN HAVE NO  REAL  FAITH UNTIL THEY MAKE THEE JUDGE IN ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN THEM AND FIND IN THEIR SOULS NO RESISTANCE AGAINST THY DECISIONS BUT ACCEPT THEM WITH THE FULLEST CONVICTION 
   IF WE HAD ORDERED THEM TO SACRIFICE THEIR LIVES OR TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES VERY FEW OF THEM WOULD HAVE DONE IT  BUT IF THEY HAD DONE WHAT THEY WERE  ACTUALLY  TOLD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BEST FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE GONE FARTHEST TO STRENGTHEN THEIR  FAITH  
   AND WE SHOULD THEN HAVE GIVEN THEM FROM OUR PRESENCE A GREAT REWARD 
   AND WE SHOULD HAVE SHOWN THEM THE STRAIGHT WAY 
   ALL WHO OBEY GOD AND THE APOSTLE ARE IN THE COMPANY OF THOSE ON WHOM IS THE GRACE OF GOD OF THE PROPHETS  WHO TEACH  THE SINCERE  LOVERS OF TRUTH  THE WITNESSES  WHO TESTIFY  AND THE RIGHTEOUS  WHO DO GOOD   AH  WHAT A BEAUTIFUL FELLOWSHIP  
   SUCH IS THE BOUNTY FROM GOD  AND SUFFICIENT IS IT THAT GOD KNOWETH ALL SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  TAKE YOUR PRECAUTIONS AND EITHER GO FORTH IN PARTIES OR GO FORTH ALL TOGETHER 
   THERE ARE CERTAINLY AMONG YOU MEN WHO WOULD TARRY BEHIND  IF A MISFORTUNE BEFALLS YOU  THEY SAY   GOD DID FAVOR US IN THAT WE WERE NOT PRESENT AMONG THEM  
   BUT IF GOOD FORTUNE COMES TO YOU FROM GOD THEY WOULD BE SURE TO SAY AS IF THERE HAD NEVER BEEN TIES OF AFFECTION BETWEEN YOU AND THEM  OH  I WISH I HAD BEEN WITH THEM  A FINE THING SHOULD I THEN HAVE MADE OF IT  
   LET THOSE FIGHT IN THE CAUSE OF GOD WHO SELL THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD FOR THE HEREAFTER TO HIM WHO FIGHTETH IN THE CAUSE OF GOD WHETHER HE IS SLAIN OR GETS VICTORY SOON SHALL WE GIVE HIM A REWARD OF GREAT  VALUE  
   AND WHY SHOULD YE NOT FIGHT IN THE CAUSE OF GOD AND OF THOSE WHO BEING WEAK ARE ILL TREATED  AND OPPRESSED   MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHOSE CRY IS   OUR LORD  RESCUE US FROM THIS TOWN WHOSE PEOPLE ARE OPPRESSORS  AND RAISE FOR US FROM THEE ONE WHO WILL PROTECT  AND RAISE FOR US FROM THEE ONE WHO WILL HELP   
   THOSE WHO BELIEVE FIGHT IN THE CAUSE OF GOD AND THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH FIGHT IN THE CAUSE OF EVIL  SO FIGHT YE AGAINST THE FRIENDS OF SATAN  FEEBLE INDEED IS THE CUNNING OF SATAN SECTION  
   HAST THOU NOT TURNED THY VISION TO THOSE WHO WERE TOLD TO HOLD BACK THEIR HANDS  FORM FIGHT  BUT ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS AND SPEND IN REGULAR CHARITY  WHEN  AT LENGTH  THE ORDER FOR FIGHTING WAS ISSUED TO THEM BEHOLD  A SECTION OF THEM FEARED MEN AS OR EVEN MORE THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE FEARED GOD  THEY SAY   OUR LORD  WHY HAST THOU ORDERED US TO FIGHT  WOULDST THOU NOT GRANT US RESPITE TO OUR  NATURAL  TERM NEAR  ENOUGH    SAY   SHORT IS THE ENJOYMENT OF THIS WORLD  THE HEREAFTER IS THE BEST FOR THOSE WHO DO RIGHT  NEVER WILL YE BE DEALT WITH UNJUSTLY IN THE VERY LEAST  
    WHEREVER YE ARE DEATH WILL FIND YOU OUT EVEN IF YE ARE IN TOWERS BUILT UP STRONG AND HIGH   IF SOME GOOD BEFALLS THEM THEY SAY  THIS IS FROM GOD   BUT IF EVIL THEY SAY  THIS IS FROM THEE   O PROPHET    SAY   ALL THINGS ARE FROM GOD  BUT WHAT HATH COME TO THESE PEOPLE THAT THEY FAIL TO UNDERSTAND A SINGLE FACT  
   WHATEVER GOOD  O MAN   HAPPENS TO THEE IS FROM GOD  BUT WHATEVER EVIL HAPPENS TO THEE IS FROM THY  OWN  SOUL  AND WE HAVE SENT THEE AS AN APOSTLE TO  INSTRUCT  MANKIND  AND ENOUGH IS GOD FOR A WITNESS 
   HE WHO OBEYS THE APOSTLE OBEYS GOD  BUT IF ANY TURN AWAY WE HAVE NOT SENT THEE TO WATCH OVER THEIR  EVIL DEEDS  
   THEY HAVE  OBEDIENCE  ON THEIR LIPS  BUT WHEN THEY LEAVE THEE A SECTION OF THEM MEDITATE ALL NIGHT ON THINGS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THOU TELLEST THEM BUT GOD RECORDS THEIR NIGHTLY  PLOTS   SO KEEP CLEAR OF THEM AND PUT THY TRUST IN GOD  AND ENOUGH IS GOD AS A DISPOSER OF AFFAIRS 
   DO THEY NOT CONSIDER THE QUR AN  WITH CARE   HAD IT BEEN FROM OTHER THAN GOD THEY WOULD SURELY HAVE FOUND THEREIN MUCH DISCREPANCY 
   WHEN THERE COMES TO THEM SOME MATTER TOUCHING  PUBLIC  SAFETY OR FEAR THEY DIVULGE IT  IF THEY HAD ONLY REFERRED IT TO THE APOSTLE OR TO THOSE CHARGED WITH AUTHORITY AMONG THEM THE PROPER INVESTIGATORS WOULD HAVE TESTED IT FROM THEM  DIRECT   WERE IT NOT FOR THE GRACE AND MERCY OF GOD UNTO YOU ALL BUT A FEW OF YOU WOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE CLUTCHES OF SATAN 
   THEN FIGHT IN GOD S CAUSE THOU ART HELD RESPONSIBLE ONLY FOR THYSELF AND ROUSE THE BELIEVERS  IT MAY BE THAT GOD WILL RESTRAIN THE FURY OF THE UNBELIEVERS  FOR GOD IS THE STRONGEST IN MIGHT AND IN PUNISHMENT 
   WHOEVER RECOMMENDS AND HELPS A GOOD CAUSE BECOMES A PARTNER THEREIN  AND WHOEVER RECOMMENDS AND HELPS AN EVIL CAUSE SHARES IN ITS BURDEN  AND GOD HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   WHEN A  COURTEOUS  GREETING IS OFFERED YOU MEET IT WITH A GREETING STILL MORE COURTEOUS  AT LEAST  OF EQUAL COURTESY  GOD TAKES CAREFUL ACCOUNT OF ALL THINGS 
   GOD  THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE  OF A SURETY HE WILL GATHER YOU TOGETHER AGAINST THE DAY OF JUDGMENT ABOUT WHICH THERE IS NO DOUBT  AND WHOSE WORD CAN BE TRUER THAN GOD S  SECTION

   THEY BUT WISH THAT YE SHOULD REJECT FAITH AS THEY DO AND THUS BE ON THE SAME FOOTING  AS THEY   BUT TAKE NOT FRIENDS FROM THEIR RANKS UNTIL THEY FLEE IN THE WAY OF GOD  FROM WHAT IS FORBIDDEN   BUT IF THEY TURN RENEGADES SEIZE THEM AND SLAY THEM WHEREVER YE FIND THEM  AND  IN ANY CASE  TAKE NO FRIENDS OR HELPERS FROM THEIR RANKS 
   EXCEPT THOSE WHO JOIN A GROUP BETWEEN WHOM AND YOU THERE IS A TREATY  OF PEACE  OR THOSE WHO APPROACH YOU WITH HEARTS RESTRAINING THEM FROM FIGHTING YOU AS WELL AS FIGHTING THEIR OWN PEOPLE  IF GOD HAD PLEASED HE COULD HAVE GIVEN THEM POWER OVER YOU AND THEY WOULD HAVE FOUGHT YOU  THEREFORE IF THEY WITHDRAW FROM YOU BUT FIGHT YOU NOT AND  INSTEAD  SEND YOU  GUARANTEES OF  PEACE THEN GOD HATH OPENED NO WAY FOR YOU  TO WAR AGAINST THEM  
   OTHERS YOU WILL FIND THAT WISH TO GAIN YOUR CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS THAT OF THEIR PEOPLE  EVERY TIME THEY ARE SENT BACK TO TEMPTATION THEY SUCCUMB THERETO  IF THEY WITHDRAW NOT FROM YOU NOR GIVE YOU  GUARANTEES  OF PEACE BESIDES RESTRAINING THEIR HANDS SEIZE THEM AND SLAY THEM  WHEREVER YE GET THEM  IN THEIR CASE WE HAVE PROVIDED YOU WITH A CLEAR ARGUMENT AGAINST THEM SECTION  
   NEVER SHOULD A BELIEVER KILL A BELIEVER  BUT  IF IT SO HAPPENS  BY MISTAKE  COMPENSATION IS DUE   IF ONE  SO  KILLS A BELIEVER IT IS ORDAINED THAT HE SHOULD FREE A BELIEVING SLAVE AND PAY COMPENSATION TO THE DECEASED S FAMILY UNLESS THEY REMIT IT FREELY  IF THE DECEASED BELONGED TO A PEOPLE AT WAR WITH YOU AND HE WAS A BELIEVER THE FREEING OF A BELIEVING SLAVE  IS ENOUGH   IF HE BELONGED TO A PEOPLE WITH WHOM YE HAVE A TREATY OF MUTUAL ALLIANCE COMPENSATION SHOULD BE PAID TO HIS FAMILY AND A BELIEVING SLAVE BE FREED  FOR THOSE WHO FIND THIS BEYOND THEIR MEANS  IS PRESCRIBED  A FAST FOR TWO MONTHS RUNNING  BY WAY OF REPENTANCE TO GOD  FOR GOD HATH ALL KNOWLEDGE AND ALL WISDOM 
   IF A MAN KILLS A BELIEVER INTENTIONALLY HIS RECOMPENSE IS HELL TO ABIDE THEREIN  FOR EVER   AND THE WRATH AND THE CURSE OF GOD ARE UPON HIM AND A DREADFUL PENALTY IS PREPARED FOR HIM 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  WHEN YE GO ABROAD IN THE CAUSE OF GOD INVESTIGATE CAREFULLY AND SAY NOT TO ANYONE WHO OFFERS YOU A SALUTATION   THOU ART NONE OF A BELIEVER   COVETING THE PERISHABLE GOODS OF THIS LIFE  WITH GOD ARE PROFITS AND SPOILS ABUNDANT  EVEN THUS WERE YE YOURSELVES BEFORE TILL GOD CONFERRED ON YOU HIS FAVORS  THEREFORE CAREFULLY INVESTIGATE FOR GOD IS WELL AWARE OF ALL THAT YE DO 
   NOT EQUAL ARE THOSE BELIEVERS WHO SIT  AT HOME  AND RECEIVE NO HURT AND THOSE WHO STRIVE AND FIGHT IN THE CAUSE OF GOD WITH THEIR GOODS AND THEIR PERSONS  GOD HATH GRANTED A GRADE HIGHER TO THOSE WHO STRIVE AND FIGHT WITH THEIR GOODS AND PERSONS THAN TO THOSE WHO SIT  AT HOME   UNTO ALL  IN FAITH  HATH GOD PROMISED GOOD  BUT THOSE WHO STRIVE AND FIGHT HATH HE DISTINGUISHED ABOVE THOSE WHO SIT  AT HOME  BY A SPECIAL REWARD

   EXCEPT THOSE WHO ARE  REALLY  WEAK AND OPPRESSED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE NO MEANS IN THEIR POWER NOR  A GUIDE POST  TO DIRECT THEIR WAY 
   FOR THESE THERE IS HOPE THAT GOD WILL FORGIVE  FOR GOD DOTH BLOT OUT  SINS  AND FORGIVE AGAIN AND AGAIN 
   HE WHO FORSAKES HIS HOME IN THE CAUSE OF GOD FINDS IN THE EARTH MANY A REFUGE WIDE AND SPACIOUS  SHOULD HE DIE AS A REFUGEE FROM HOME FOR GOD AND HIS APOSTLE HIS REWARD BECOMES DUE AND SURE WITH GOD  AND GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL SECTION  
   WHEN YE TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH THERE IS NO BLAME ON YOU IF YE SHORTEN YOUR PRAYERS FOR FEAR THE UNBELIEVERS MAY ATTACK YOU  FOR THE UNBELIEVERS ARE UNTO YOU OPEN ENEMIES 
   WHEN THOU  O APOSTLE  ART WITH THEM AND STANDEST TO LEAD THEM IN PRAYER LET ONE PARTY OF THEM STAND UP  IN PRAYER  WITH THEE TAKING THEIR ARMS WITH THEM  WHEN THEY FINISH THEIR PROSTRATIONS LET THEM TAKE THEIR POSITIONS IN THE REAR AND LET THE OTHER PARTY COME UP WHICH HATH NOT YET PRAYED AND LET THEM PRAY WITH THEE TAKING ALL PRECAUTIONS AND BEARING ARMS  THE UNBELIEVERS WISH IF YE WERE NEGLIGENT OF YOUR ARMS AND YOUR BAGGAGE TO ASSAULT YOU IN A SINGLE RUSH BUT THERE IS NO BLAME ON YOU IF YE PUT AWAY YOUR ARMS BECAUSE OF THE INCONVENIENCE OF RAIN OR BECAUSE YE ARE ILL  BUT TAKE  EVERY  PRECAUTION FOR YOURSELVES  FOR THE UNBELIEVERS GOD HATH PREPARED A HUMILIATING PUNISHMENT 
   WHEN YE PASS  CONGREGATIONAL  PRAYERS CELEBRATE GOD S PRAISES STANDING SITTING DOWN OR LYING DOWN ON YOUR SIDES  BUT WHEN YE ARE FREE FROM DANGER SET UP REGULAR PRAYERS  FOR SUCH PRAYERS ARE ENJOINED ON BELIEVERS AT STATED TIMES 
   AND SLACKEN NOT IN FOLLOWING UP THE ENEMY  IF YE ARE SUFFERING HARDSHIPS THEY ARE SUFFERING SIMILAR HARDSHIPS  BUT YE HAVE HOPE FROM GOD WHILE THEY HAVE NONE  AND GOD IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM SECTION  
   WE HAVE SENT DOWN TO THEE THE BOOK IN TRUTH THAT THOU MIGHTEST JUDGE BETWEEN MEN AS GUIDED BY GOD  SO BE NOT  USED  AS AN ADVOCATE BY THOSE WHO BETRAY THEIR TRUST 
   BUT SEEK THE FORGIVENESS OF GOD  FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   CONTEND NOT ON BEHALF OF SUCH AS BETRAY THEIR OWN SOULS  FOR GOD LOVETH NOT ONE GIVEN TO PERFIDY AND CRIME 
   THEY MAY HIDE  THEIR CRIMES  FROM MEN BUT THEY CANNOT HIDE  THEM  FROM GOD SEEING THAT HE IS IN THEIR MIDST WHEN THEY PLOT BY NIGHT IN WORDS THAT HE CANNOT APPROVE  AND GOD DOTH COMPASS ROUND ALL THAT THEY DO 
   AH  THESE ARE THE SORT OF MEN ON WHOSE BEHALF YE MAY CONTEND IN THIS WORLD  BUT WHO WILL CONTEND WITH GOD ON THEIR BEHALF ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT OR WHO WILL CARRY THEIR AFFAIRS THROUGH 
   IF ANYONE DOES EVIL OR WRONGS HIS OWN SOUL BUT AFTERWARDS SEEKS GOD S FORGIVENESS HE WILL FIND GOD OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   AND IF ANYONE EARNS SIN HE EARNS IT AGAINST HIS OWN SOUL  FOR GOD IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM 
   BUT IF ANYONE EARNS A FAULT OR A SIN AND THROWS IT ON TO ONE THAT IS INNOCENT HE CARRIES  ON HIMSELF   BOTH  A FALSEHOOD AND A FLAGRANT SIN SECTION  
   BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD TO THEE AND HIS MERCY A PARTY OF THEM WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE PLOTTED TO LEAD THEE ASTRAY  BUT  IN FACT  THEY WILL ONLY LEAD THEIR OWN SOULS ASTRAY AND TO THEE THEY CAN DO NO HARM IN THE LEAST  FOR GOD HATH SENT DOWN TO THEE THE BOOK AND WISDOM AND TAUGHT THEE WHAT THOU KNEWEST NOT  BEFORE   AND GREAT IS THE GRACE OF GOD UNTO THEE 
   IN MOST OF THEIR SECRET TALKS THERE IS NO GOOD  BUT IF ONE EXHORTS TO A DEED OF CHARITY OR JUSTICE OR CONCILIATION BETWEEN MEN  SECRECY IS PERMISSIBLE   TO HIM WHO DOES THIS SEEKING THE GOOD PLEASURE OF GOD WE SHALL SOON GIVE A REWARD OF THE HIGHEST  VALUE

    I WILL MISLEAD THEM AND I WILL CREATE IN THEM FALSE DESIRES  I WILL ORDER THEM TO SLIT THE EARS OF CATTLE AND TO DEFACE THE  FAIR  NATURE CREATED BY GOD   WHOEVER FORSAKING GOD TAKES SATAN FOR A FRIEND HATH OF A SURETY SUFFERED A LOSS THAT IS MANIFEST 
   SATAN MAKES THEM PROMISES AND CREATES IN THEM FALSE DESIRES  BUT SATAN S PROMISES ARE NOTHING BUT DECEPTION 
   THEY  HIS DUPES  WILL HAVE THEIR DWELLING IN HELL AND FROM IT THEY WILL FIND NO WAY OF ESCAPE 
   BUT THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND DO DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WE SHALL SOON ADMIT THEM TO GARDENS WITH RIVERS FLOWING BENEATH TO DWELL THEREIN FOR EVER  GOD S PROMISE IS THE TRUTH AND WHOSE WORD CAN BE TRUER THAN GOD S

   THAT THEY SAID  IN BOAST   WE KILLED CHRIST JESUS THE SON OF MARY THE APOSTLE OF GOD   BUT THEY KILLED HIM NOT NOR CRUCIFIED HIM BUT SO IT WAS MADE TO APPEAR TO THEM AND THOSE WHO DIFFER THEREIN ARE FULL OF DOUBTS WITH NO  CERTAIN  KNOWLEDGE BUT ONLY CONJECTURE TO FOLLOW FOR OF A SURETY THEY KILLED HIM NOT 
   NAY GOD RAISED HIM UP UNTO HIMSELF  AND GOD IS EXALTED IN POWER WISE 
   AND THERE IS NONE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK BUT MUST BELIEVE IN HIM BEFORE HIS DEATH  AND ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT HE WILL BE A WITNESS AGAINST THEM 
   FOR THE INIQUITY OF THE JEWS WE MADE UNLAWFUL FOR THEM CERTAIN  FOODS  GOOD AND WHOLESOME WHICH HAD BEEN LAWFUL FOR THEM  IN THAT THEY HINDERED MANY FROM GOD S WAY 
   THAT THEY TOOK USURY  INTEREST  THOUGH THEY WERE FORBIDDEN  AND THAT THEY DEVOURED MEN S SUBSTANCE WRONGFULLY  WE HAVE PREPARED FOR THOSE AMONG THEM WHO REJECT FAITH A GRIEVOUS PUNISHMENT 
   BUT THOSE AMONG THEM WHO ARE WELL GROUNDED IN KNOWLEDGE AND THE BELIEVERS BELIEVE IN WHAT HATH BEEN REVEALED TO THEE  AND  ESPECIALLY  THOSE WHO ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER AND PRACTICE REGULAR CHARITY AND BELIEVE IN GOD AND IN THE LAST DAY  TO THEM SHALL WE SOON GIVE A GREAT REWARD SECTION  
   WE HAVE SENT THEE INSPIRATION AS WE SENT IT TO NOAH AND THE MESSENGERS AFTER HIM  WE SENT INSPIRATION TO ABRAHAM ISMAIL ISAAC JACOB AND THE TRIBES TO JESUS JOB JONAH AARON AND SOLOMON AND TO DAVID WE GAVE THE PSALMS 
   OF SOME APOSTLES WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD THEE THE STORY  OF OTHERS WE HAVE NOT  AND TO MOSES GOD SPOKE DIRECT 
   APOSTLES WHO GAVE GOOD NEWS AS WELL AS WARNING THAT MANKIND AFTER  THE COMING  OF THE APOSTLES SHOULD HAVE NO PLEA AGAINST GOD  FOR GOD IS EXALTED IN POWER  WISE 
   BUT GOD BEARETH WITNESS THAT WHAT HE HATH SENT UNTO THEE HE HATH SENT FROM HIS  OWN  KNOWLEDGE AND THE ANGELS BEAR WITNESS  BUT ENOUGH IS GOD FOR A WITNESS 
   THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH AND KEEP OFF  MEN  FROM THE WAY OF GOD HAVE VERILY STRAYED FAR FAR AWAY FROM THE PATH 
   THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH AND DO WRONG GOD WILL NOT FORGIVE THEM NOR GUIDE THEM TO ANY WAY 
   EXCEPT THE WAY OF HELL TO DWELL THEREIN FOR EVER  AND THIS TO GOD IS EASY 
   O MANKIND  THE APOSTLE HATH COME TO YOU IN TRUTH FROM GOD  BELIEVE IN HIM  IT IS BEST FOR YOU  BUT IF YE REJECT FAITH TO GOD BELONG ALL THINGS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  AND GOD IS ALL KNOWING  ALL WISE 
   O PEOPLE OF THE BOOK  COMMIT NO EXCESSES IN YOUR RELIGION  NOR SAY OF GOD AUGHT BUT TRUTH  CHRIST JESUS THE SON OF MARY WAS  NO MORE THAN  AN APOSTLE OF GOD AND HIS WORD WHICH HE BESTOWED ON MARY AND A SPIRIT PROCEEDING FROM HIM  SO BELIEVE IN GOD AND HIS APOSTLES  SAY NOT  TRINITY   DESIST  IT WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU  FOR GOD IS ONE GOD  GLORY BE TO HIM   FOR EXALTED IS HE  ABOVE HAVING A SON  TO HIM BELONG ALL THINGS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  AND ENOUGH IS GOD AS A DISPOSER OF AFFAIRS SECTION  
   CHRIST DISDAINETH NOT TO SERVE AND WORSHIP GOD NOR DO THE ANGELS THOSE NEAREST  TO GOD   THOSE WHO DISDAIN HIS WORSHIP AND ARE ARROGANT HE WILL GATHER THEM ALL TOGETHER UNTO HIMSELF TO  ANSWER  
   BUT THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND DO DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS HE WILL GIVE THEIR  DUE  REWARDS AND MORE OUT OF HIS BOUNTY  BUT THOSE WHO ARE DISDAINFUL AND ARROGANT HE WILL PUNISH WITH A GRIEVOUS PENALTY  NOR WILL THEY FIND BESIDES GOD ANY TO PROTECT OR HELP THEM

   O YE WHO BELIEVE  CALL IN REMEMBRANCE THE FAVOR OF GOD UNTO YOU WHEN CERTAIN MEN FORMED THE DESIGN TO STRETCH OUT THEIR HANDS AGAINST YOU BUT  GOD  HELD BACK THEIR HANDS FROM YOU  SO FEAR GOD  AND ON GOD LET BELIEVERS PUT  ALL  THEIR TRUST SECTION  
   ALLAH DID AFORETIME TAKE A COVENANT FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND WE APPOINTED TWELVE CAPTAINS AMONG THEM AND GOD SAID   I AM WITH YOU  IF YE  BUT  ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS PRACTICE REGULAR CHARITY BELIEVE IN MY APOSTLES HONOR AND ASSIST THEM AND LOAN TO GOD A BEAUTIFUL LOAN VERILY I WILL WIPE OUT FROM YOU YOUR EVILS AND ADMIT YOU TO GARDENS WITH RIVERS FLOWING BENEATH  BUT IF ANY OF YOU AFTER THIS RESISTETH FAITH HE HATH TRULY WANDERED FROM THE PATH OF RECTITUDE  
   BUT BECAUSE OF THEIR BREACH OF THEIR COVENANT WE CURSED THEM AND MADE THEIR HEARTS GROW HARD  THEY CHANGE THE WORDS FROM THEIR  RIGHT  PLACES AND FORGET A GOOD PART OF THE MESSAGE THAT WAS SENT THEM NOR WILT THOU CEASE TO FIND THEM BARRING A FEW EVER BENT ON  NEW  DECEITS  BUT FORGIVE THEM AND OVERLOOK  THEIR MISDEEDS   FOR GOD LOVETH THOSE WHO ARE KIND 
   FROM THOSE TOO WHO CALL THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS WE DID TAKE A COVENANT BUT THEY FORGOT A GOOD PART OF THE MESSAGE THAT WAS SENT THEM  SO WE ESTRANGED THEM WITH ENMITY AND HATRED BETWEEN THE ONE AND THE OTHER TO THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  AND SOON WILL GOD SHOW THEM WHAT IT IS THEY HAVE DONE 
   O PEOPLE OF THE BOOK  THERE HATH COME TO YOU OUR APOSTLE REVEALING TO YOU MUCH THAT YE USED TO HIDE IN THE BOOK AND PASSING OVER MUCH  THAT IS NOW UNNECESSARY   THERE HATH COME TO YOU FROM GOD A  NEW  LIGHT AND A PERSPICUOUS BOOK 
   WHEREWITH GOD GUIDETH ALL WHO SEEK HIS GOOD PLEASURE TO WAYS OF PEACE AND SAFETY AND LEADETH THEM OUT OF DARKNESS BY HIS WILL UNTO THE LIGHT GUIDETH THEM TO A PATH THAT IS STRAIGHT 
   IN BLASPHEMY INDEED ARE THOSE THAT SAY THAT GOD IS CHRIST THE SON OF MARY  SAY   WHO THEN HATH THE LEAST POWER AGAINST GOD IF HIS WILL WERE TO DESTROY CHRIST THE SON OF MARY HIS MOTHER AND ALL EVERYONE THAT IS ON THE EARTH  FOR TO GOD BELONGETH THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL THAT IS BETWEEN  HE CREATETH WHAT HE PLEASETH  FOR GOD HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS  
    BOTH  THE JEWS AND THE CHRISTIANS SAY   WE ARE SONS OF GOD AND HIS BELOVED   SAY   WHY THEN DOTH HE PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR SINS  NAY YE ARE BUT MEN OF THE MEN HE HATH CREATED  HE FORGIVETH WHOM HE PLEASETH AND HE PUNISHETH WHOM HE PLEASETH  AND TO GOD BELONGETH THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL THAT IS BETWEEN  AND UNTO HIM IS THE FINAL GOAL  OF ALL   
   O PEOPLE OF THE BOOK  NOW HATH COME UNTO YOU MAKING  THINGS  CLEAR UNTO YOU OUR APOSTLE AFTER THE BREAK IN  THE SERIES OF  OUR APOSTLES LEST YE SHOULD SAY  THERE CAME UNTO US NO BRINGER OF GLAD TIDINGS AND NO WARNER  FROM EVIL   BUT NOW HATH COME UNTO YOU A BRINGER OF GLAD TIDINGS AND A WARNER  FROM EVIL   AND GOD HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS SECTION  
   REMEMBER MOSES SAID TO HIS PEOPLE   O MY PEOPLE  CALL IN REMEMBRANCE THE FAVOR OF GOD UNTO YOU WHEN HE PRODUCED PROPHETS AMONG YOU MADE YOU KINGS AND GAVE YOU WHAT HE HAD NOT GIVEN TO ANY OTHER AMONG THE PEOPLES 
    O MY PEOPLE  ENTER THE HOLY LAND WHICH GOD HATH ASSIGNED UNTO YOU AND TURN NOT BACK IGNOMINIOUSLY FOR THEN WILL YE BE OVERTHROWN TO YOUR OWN RUIN  
   THEY SAID   O MOSES  IN THIS LAND ARE A PEOPLE OF EXCEEDING STRENGTH  NEVER SHALL WE ENTER IT UNTIL THEY LEAVE IT  IF  ONCE  THEY LEAVE THEN SHALL WE ENTER  
    BUT  AMONG  THEIR  GOD FEARING MEN WERE TWO ON WHOM GOD HAD BESTOWED HIS GRACE  THEY SAID   ASSAULT THEM AT THE  PROPER  GATE  WHEN ONCE YE ARE IN VICTORY WILL BE YOURS  BUT ON GOD PUT YOUR TRUST IF YE HAVE FAITH  
   THEY SAID  O  MOSES  WHILE THEY REMAIN THERE NEVER SHALL WE BE ABLE TO ENTER TO THE END OF TIME  GO THOU AND THY LORD AND FIGHT YE TWO WHILE WE SIT HERE  AND WATCH   
   HE SAID   O MY LORD  I HAVE POWER ONLY OVER MYSELF AND MY BOTHER SO SEPARATE US FROM THIS REBELLIOUS PEOPLE  
   GOD SAID   THEREFORE WILL THE LAND BE OUT OF THEIR REACH FOR FORTY YEARS  IN DISTRACTION WILL THEY WANDER THROUGH THE LAND  BUT SORROW THOU NOT OVER THESE REBELLIOUS PEOPLE  SECTION  
   RECITE TO THEM THE TRUTH OF THE STORY OF THE TWO SONS OF ADAM  BEHOLD  THEY EACH PRESENTED A SACRIFICE  TO GOD   IT WAS ACCEPTED FROM ONE BUT NOT FROM THE OTHER  SAID THE LATTER   BE SURE I WILL SLAY THEE    SURELY  SAID THE FORMER  GOD DOTH ACCEPT OF THE SACRIFICE OF THOSE WHO ARE RIGHTEOUS 
    IF THOU DOST STRETCH THY HAND AGAINST ME TO SLAY ME IT IS NOT FOR ME TO STRETCH MY HAND AGAINST THEE TO SLAY THEE  FOR I DO FEAR GOD THE CHERISHER OF THE WORLDS 
    FOR ME I INTEND TO LET THEE DRAW ON THYSELF MY SIN AS WELL AS THINE FOR THOU WILT BE AMONG THE COMPANIONS OF THE FIRE AND THAT IS THE REWARD OF THOSE WHO DO WRONG  
   THE  SELFISH  SOUL OF THE OTHER LED HIM TO THE MURDER OF HIS BROTHER  HE MURDERED HIM AND BECAME  HIMSELF  ONE OF THE LOST ONES 
   THEN GOD SENT A RAVEN WHO SCRATCHED THE GROUND TO SHOW HIM HOW TO HIDE THE SHAME OF HIS BROTHER   WOE IS ME   SAID HE   WAS I NOT EVEN ABLE TO BE AS THIS RAVEN AND TO HIDE THE SHAME OF MY BROTHER   THEN HE BECAME FULL OF REGRETS 
   ON THAT ACCOUNT  WE ORDAINED FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THAT IF ANYONE SLEW A PERSON UNLESS IT BE FOR MURDER OR FOR SPREADING MISCHIEF IN THE LAND IT WOULD BE AS IF HE SLEW THE WHOLE PEOPLE  AND IF ANYONE SAVED A LIFE IT WOULD BE AS IF HE SAVED THE LIFE OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE  THEN ALTHOUGH THERE CAME TO THEM OUR APOSTLES WITH CLEAR SIGNS YET EVEN AFTER THAT MANY OF THEM CONTINUED TO COMMIT EXCESSES IN THE LAND 
   THE PUNISHMENT OF THOSE WHO WAGE WAR AGAINST GOD AND HIS APOSTLE AND STRIVE WITH MIGHT AND MAIN FOR MISCHIEF THROUGH THE LAND IS  EXECUTION OR CRUCIFIXION OF THE CUTTING OFF OF HANDS AND FEET FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OR EXILE FROM THE LAND  THAT IS THEIR DISGRACE IN THIS WORLD AND A HEAVY PUNISHMENT IS THEIRS IN THE HEREAFTER 
   EXCEPT FOR THOSE WHO REPENT BEFORE THEY FALL INTO YOUR POWER  IN THAT CASE KNOW THAT GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  DO YOUR DUTY TO GOD SEEK THE MEANS OF APPROACH UNTO HIM AND STRIVE WITH MIGHT AND MAIN IN HIS CAUSE  THAT YE MAY PROSPER 
   AS TO THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH IF THEY HAD EVERYTHING ON EARTH AND TWICE REPEATED TO GIVE AS RANSOM FOR THE PENALTY OF THE DAY OF JUDGMENT IT WOULD NEVER BE ACCEPTED OF THEM  THEIRS WOULD BE A GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   THEIR WISH WILL BE TO GET OUT OF THE FIRE BUT NEVER WILL THEY GET OUT THEREFROM  THEIR PENALTY WILL BE ONE THAT ENDURES 
   AS TO THE THIEF MALE OR FEMALE CUT OFF HIS OR HER HANDS  A PUNISHMENT BY WAY OF EXAMPLE FROM GOD FOR THEIR CRIME  AND GOD IS EXALTED IN POWER 
   BUT IF THE THIEF REPENT AFTER HIS CRIME AND AMEND HIS CONDUCT GOD TURNETH TO HIM IN FORGIVENESS  FOR GOD IF OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   KNOWEST THOU NOT THAT TO GOD  ALONE  BELONGETH THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  HE PUNISHETH WHOM HE PLEASETH AND HE FORGIVETH WHOM HE PLEASETH  AND GOD HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   O APOSTLE  LET NOT THOSE GRIEVE THEE WHO RACE EACH OTHER INTO UNBELIEF   WHETHER IT BE  AMONG THOSE WHO SAY   WE BELIEVE  WITH THEIR LIPS BUT WHOSE HEARTS HAVE NO FAITH  OR IT BE AMONG THE JEWS MEN WHO WILL LISTEN TO ANY LIE WILL LISTEN EVEN TO OTHERS WHO HAVE NEVER SO MUCH AS COME TO THEE  THEY CHANGE THE WORDS FROM THEIR  RIGHT  TIMES AND PLACES  THEY SAY  IF YE ARE GIVEN THIS TAKE IT BUT IF NOT BEWARE   IF ANYONE S TRIAL IS INTENDED BY GOD THOU HAST NO AUTHORITY IN THE LEAST FOR HIM AGAINST GOD  FOR SUCH IT IS NOT GOD S WILL TO PURIFY THEIR HEARTS  FOR THEM THERE IS DISGRACE IN THIS WORLD AND IN THE HEREAFTER A HEAVY PUNISHMENT 
    THEY ARE FOND OF  LISTENING TO FALSEHOOD OF DEVOURING ANYTHING FORBIDDEN  IF THEY DO COME TO THEE EITHER JUDGE BETWEEN THEM OR DECLINE TO INTERFERE  IF THOU DECLINE THEY CANNOT HURT THEE IN THE LEAST  IF THOU JUDGE JUDGE IN EQUITY BETWEEN THEM  FOR GOD LOVETH THOSE WHO JUDGE IN EQUITY 
   BUT WHY DO THEY COME TO THEE FOR DECISION WHEN THEY HAVE  THEIR OWN  LAWS BEFORE THEM  THEREIN IS THE  PLAIN  COMMAND OF GOD  YET EVEN AFTER THAT THEY WOULD TURN AWAY  FOR THEY ARE NOT  REALLY  PEOPLE OF FAITH SECTION  
   IT WAS WE WHO REVEALED THE LAW  TO MOSES   THEREIN WAS GUIDANCE AND LIGHT  BY ITS STANDARD HAVE BEEN JUDGED THE JEWS BY THE PROPHET WHO BOWED  AS IN ISLAM  TO GOD S WILL BY THE RABBIS AND THE DOCTORS OF LAW  FOR TO THEM WAS ENTRUSTED THE PROTECTION OF GOD S BOOK AND THEY WERE WITNESSES THERETO  THEREFORE FEAR NOT MEN BUT FEAR ME AND SELL NOT MY SIGNS FOR A MISERABLE PRICE  IF ANY DO FAIL TO JUDGE BY  THE LIGHT OF  WHAT GOD HATH REVEALED THEY ARE  NO BETTER THAN  UNBELIEVERS 
   WE ORDAINED THEREIN FOR THEM   LIFE FOR LIFE EYE FOR EYE NOSE FOR NOSE EAR FOR EAR TOOTH FOR TOOTH AND WOUNDS EQUAL FOR EQUAL   BUT IF ANYONE REMITS THE RETALIATION BY WAY OF CHARITY IT IS AN ACT OF ATONEMENT FOR HIMSELF  AND IF ANY FAIL TO JUDGE BY  THE LIGHT OF  WHAT GOD HATH REVEALED THEY ARE  NO BETTER THAN  WRONG DOERS 
   AND IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS WE SENT JESUS THE SON OF MARY CONFIRMING THE LAW THAT HAD COME BEFORE HIM  WE SENT HIM THE GOSPEL  THEREIN WAS GUIDANCE AND LIGHT AND CONFIRMATION OF THE LAW THAT HAD COME BEFORE HIM  A GUIDANCE AND AN ADMONITION TO THOSE WHO FEAR GOD 
   LET THE PEOPLE OF THE GOSPEL JUDGE BY WHAT GOD HATH REVEALED THEREIN  IF ANY DO FAIL TO JUDGE BY  THE LIGHT OF  WHAT GOD HATH REVEALED THEY ARE  NO BETTER THAN  THOSE WHO REBEL 
   TO THEE WE SENT THE SCRIPTURE IN TRUTH CONFIRMING THE SCRIPTURE THAT CAME BEFORE IT AND GUARDING IT IN SAFETY  SO JUDGE BETWEEN THEM BY WHAT GOD HATH REVEALED AND FOLLOW NOT THEIR VAIN DESIRES DIVERGING FROM THE TRUTH THAT HATH COME TO THEE  TO EACH AMONG YOU HAVE WE PRESCRIBED A LAW AND AN OPEN WAY  IF GOD HAD SO WILLED HE WOULD HAVE MADE YOU A SINGLE PEOPLE BUT  HIS PLAN IS  TO TEST YOU IN WHAT HE HATH GIVEN YOU  SO STRIVE AS IN A RACE IN ALL VIRTUES  THE GOAL OF YOU ALL IS TO GOD  IT IS HE THAT WILL SHOW YOU THE TRUTH OF THE MATTERS IN WHICH YE DISPUTE 
   AND THIS  HE COMMANDS   JUDGE THOU BETWEEN THEM BY WHAT GOD HATH REVEALED AND FOLLOW NOT THEIR VAIN DESIRES BUT BEWARE OF THEM LEST THEY BEGUILE THEE FROM ANY OF THAT  TEACHING  WHICH GOD HATH SENT DOWN TO THEE  AND IF THEY TURN AWAY BE ASSURED THAT FOR SOME OF THEIR CRIMES IT IS GOD S PURPOSE TO PUNISH THEM  AND TRULY MOST MEN ARE REBELLIOUS 
   DO THEY THEN SEEK AFTER A JUDGMENT OF  THE DAYS OF  IGNORANCE  BUT WHO FOR A PEOPLE WHOSE FAITH IS ASSURED CAN GIVE BETTER JUDGMENT THAN GOD SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  TAKE NOT THE JEWS AND THE CHRISTIANS FOR YOUR FRIENDS AND PROTECTORS  THEY ARE BUT FRIENDS AND PROTECTORS TO EACH OTHER  AND HE AMONGST YOU THAT TURNS TO THEM  FOR FRIENDSHIP  IS OF THEM  VERILY GOD GUIDETH NOT A PEOPLE UNJUST 
   THOSE IN WHOSE HEART IS A DISEASE THOU SEEST HOW EAGERLY THEY RUN ABOUT AMONGST THEM SAYING   WE DO FEAR LEST A CHANGE OF FORTUNE BRING US DISASTER   AH  PERHAPS GOD WILL GIVE  THEE  VICTORY OR A DECISION ACCORDING TO HIS WILL  THEN WILL THEY REPENT OF THE THOUGHTS WHICH THEY SECRETLY HARBORED IN THEIR HEARTS 
   AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE WILL SAY   ARE THESE THE MEN WHO SWORE THEIR STRONGEST OATHS BY GOD THAT THEY WERE WITH YOU   ALL THAT THEY DO WILL BE IN VAIN AND THEY WILL FALL INTO  NOTHING BUT  RUIN 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  IF ANY FROM AMONG YOU TURN BACK FROM HIS FAITH SOON WILL GOD PRODUCE A PEOPLE WHOM HE WILL LOVE AS THEY WILL LOVE HIM LOWLY WITH THE BELIEVERS MIGHTY AGAINST THE REJECTERS FIGHTING IN THE WAY OF GOD AND NEVER AFRAID OF THE REPROACHES OF SUCH AS FIND FAULT  THAT IS THE GRACE OF GOD WHICH HE WILL BESTOW ON WHOM HE PLEASETH  AND GOD ENCOMPASSETH ALL AND HE KNOWETH ALL THINGS 
   YOUR  REAL  FRIENDS ARE  NO LESS THAN  GOD HIS APOSTLE AND THE  FELLOWSHIP OF  BELIEVERS THOSE WHO ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS AND REGULAR CHARITY AND THEY BOW DOWN HUMBLY  IN WORSHIP  
   AS TO THOSE WHO TURN  FOR FRIENDSHIP  TO GOD HIS APOSTLE AND THE  FELLOWSHIP OF  BELIEVERS IT IS THE FELLOWSHIP OF GOD THAT MUST CERTAINLY TRIUMPH SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  TAKE NOT FOR FRIENDS AND PROTECTORS THOSE WHO TAKE YOUR RELIGION FOR A MOCKERY OR SPORT WHETHER AMONG THOSE WHO RECEIVED THE SCRIPTURE BEFORE YOU OR AMONG THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH  BUT FEAR YE GOD IF YE HAVE FAITH  INDEED  
   WHEN YE PROCLAIM YOUR CALL TO PRAYER THEY TAKE IT  BUT  AS MOCKERY AND SPORT  THAT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE A PEOPLE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING 
   SAY   O PEOPLE OF THE BOOK  DO YE DISAPPROVE OF US FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT WE BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE REVELATION THAT HATH COME TO US AND THAT WHICH CAME BEFORE  US  AND  PERHAPS  THAT MOST OF YOU ARE REBELLIOUS AND DISOBEDIENT  
   SAY   SHALL I POINT OUT TO YOU SOMETHING MUCH WORSE THAN THIS  AS JUDGED  BY THE TREATMENT IT RECEIVED FROM GOD  THOSE WHO INCURRED THE CURSE OF GOD AND HIS WRATH THOSE OF WHOM SOME HE TRANSFORMED INTO APES AND SWINE THOSE WHO WORSHIPPED EVIL  THESE ARE  MANY TIMES  WORSE IN RANK AND FAR MORE ASTRAY FROM THE EVEN PATH 
   WHEN THEY COME TO THEE THEY SAY   WE BELIEVE   BUT IN FACT THEY ENTER WITH A MIND AGAINST FAITH AND THEY GO OUT WITH THE SAME  BUT GOD KNOWETH FULLY ALL THAT THEY HIDE 
   MANY OF THEM DOST THOU SEE RACING EACH OTHER IN SIN AND RANCOR AND THEIR EATING OF THINGS FORBIDDEN  EVIL INDEED ARE THE THINGS THAT THEY DO 
   WHY DO NOT THE RABBIS AND THE DOCTORS OF LAWS FORBID THEM FROM THEIR  HABIT OF  UTTERING SINFUL WORDS AND EATING THINGS FORBIDDEN  EVIL INDEED ARE THEIR WORKS 
   THE JEWS SAY   GOD S HAND IS TIED UP   BE THEIR HANDS TIED UP AND BE THEY ACCURSED FOR THE  BLASPHEMY  THEY UTTER  NAY BOTH HIS HANDS ARE WIDELY OUTSTRETCHED  HE GIVETH AND SPENDETH  OF HIS BOUNTY  AS HE PLEASETH  BUT THE REVELATION THAT COMETH TO THEE FROM GOD INCREASETH IN MOST OF THEM THEIR OBSTINATE REBELLION AND BLASPHEMY  AMONGST THEM WE HAVE PLACED ENMITY AND HATRED TILL THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  EVERY TIME THEY KINDLE THE FIRE OF WAR GOD DOTH EXTINGUISH IT  BUT THEY  EVER  STRIVE TO DO MISCHIEF ON EARTH  AND GOD LOVETH NOT THOSE WHO DO MISCHIEF 
   IF ONLY THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK HAD BELIEVED AND BEEN RIGHTEOUS WE SHOULD INDEED HAVE BLOTTED OUT THEIR INIQUITIES AND ADMITTED THEM TO GARDENS OF BLISS 
   IF ONLY THEY HAD STOOD FAST BY THE LAW THE GOSPEL AND ALL THE REVELATION THAT WAS SENT TO THEM FROM THEIR LORD THEY WOULD HAVE ENJOYED HAPPINESS FROM EVERY SIDE  THERE IS FROM AMONG THEM A PARTY ON THE RIGHT COURSE  BUT MANY OF THEM FOLLOW A COURSE THAT IS EVIL SECTION  
   O APOSTLE  PROCLAIM THE  MESSAGE  WHICH HATH BEEN SENT TO THEE FROM THY LORD  IF THOU DIDST NOT THOU WOULDST NOT HAVE FULFILLED AND PROCLAIMED HIS MISSION  AND GOD WILL DEFEND THEE FROM MEN  WHO MEAN MISCHIEF   FOR GOD GUIDETH NOT THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH 
   SAY   O PEOPLE OF THE BOOK  YE HAVE NO GROUND TO STAND UPON UNLESS YE STAND FAST BY THE LAW THE GOSPEL AND ALL THE REVELATION THAT HAS COME TO YOU FROM YOUR LORD   IT IS THE REVELATION THAT COMETH TO THEE FROM THY LORD THAT INCREASETH IN MOST OF THEM THEIR OBSTINATE REBELLION AND BLASPHEMY  BUT SORROW THOU NOT OVER  THESE  PEOPLE WITHOUT FAITH 
   THOSE WHO BELIEVE  IN THE QUR AN  THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE JEWISH  SCRIPTURES  AND THE SABIANS AND THE CHRISTIANS ANY WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS ON THEM SHALL BE NO FEAR NOR SHALL THEY GRIEVE 
   WE TOOK THE COVENANT OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SENT THEM APOSTLES  EVERY TIME THERE CAME TO THEM AN APOSTLE WITH WHAT THEY THEMSELVES DESIRED NOT SOME  OF THESE  THEY CALLED IMPOSTORS AND SOME THEY  GO SO FAR AS TO  SLAY 
   THEY THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE NO TRIAL  OR PUNISHMENT   SO THEY BECAME BLIND AND DEAF  YET GOD  IN MERCY  TURNED TO THEM  YET AGAIN MANY OF THEM BECAME BLIND AND DEAF  BUT GOD SEES WELL ALL THAT THEY DO 
   THEY DO BLASPHEME WHO SAY   GOD IS CHRIST THE SON OF MARY   BUT SAID CHRIST   O CHILDREN OF ISRAEL  WORSHIP GOD MY LORD AND YOUR LORD   WHOEVER JOINS OTHER GODS WITH GOD GOD WILL FORBID HIM THE GARDEN AND THE FIRE WILL BE HIS ABODE  THERE WILL FOR THE WRONG DOERS BE NO ONE TO HELP 
   THEY DO BLASPHEME WHO SAY  GOD IS ONE OF THREE IN A TRINITY  FOR THERE IS NO GOD EXCEPT ONE GOD  IF THEY DESIST NOT FROM THEIR WORD  OF BLASPHEMY  VERILY A GRIEVOUS PENALTY WILL BEFALL THE BLASPHEMERS AMONG THEM 
   WHY TURN THEY NOT TO GOD AND SEEK HIS FORGIVENESS  FOR GOD IS OFT  FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   CHRIST THE SON OF MARY WAS NO MORE THAN AN APOSTLE  MANY WERE THE APOSTLES THAT PASSED AWAY BEFORE HIM  HIS MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF TRUTH  THEY HAD BOTH TO EAT THEIR  DAILY  FOOD  SEE HOW GOD DOTH MAKES HIS SIGNS CLEAR TO THEM  YET SEE IN WHAT WAYS THEY ARE DELUDED AWAY FROM THE TRUTH 
   SAY  WILL YE WORSHIP BESIDES GOD SOMETHING WHICH HATH NO POWER EITHER TO HARM OR BENEFIT YOU  BUT GOD HE IT IS THAT HEARETH AND KNOWETH ALL THINGS  
   SAY   O PEOPLE OF THE BOOK  EXCEED NOT IN YOUR RELIGION THE BOUNDS  OF WHAT IS PROPER  TRESPASSING BEYOND THE TRUTH NOR FOLLOW THE VAIN DESIRES OF PEOPLE WHO WENT WRONG IN TIMES GONE BY WHO MISLED MANY AND STRAYED  THEMSELVES  FROM THE EVEN WAY SECTION  
   CURSES WERE PRONOUNCED ON THOSE AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WHO REJECTED FAITH BY THE TONGUE OF DAVID AND OF JESUS THE SON OF MARY  BECAUSE THEY DISOBEYED AND PERSISTED IN EXCESSES 
   NOR DID THEY  USUALLY  FORBID ONE ANOTHER THE INIQUITIES WHICH THEY COMMITTED  EVIL INDEED WERE THE DEEDS WHICH THEY DID 
   THOU SEEST MANY OF THEM TURNING IN FRIENDSHIP TO THE UNBELIEVERS  EVIL INDEED ARE  THE WORKS  WHICH THEIR SOULS HAVE SENT FORWARD BEFORE THEM  WITH THE RESULT  THAT GOD S WRATH IS ON THEM AND IN TORMENT WILL THEY ABIDE 
   IF ONLY THEY HAD BELIEVED IN GOD IN THE APOSTLE AND IN WHAT HATH BEEN REVEALED TO HIM NEVER WOULD THEY HAVE TAKEN THEM FOR FRIENDS AND PROTECTORS BUT MOST OF THEM ARE REBELLIOUS WRONG DOERS 
   STRONGEST AMONG MEN IN ENMITY TO THE BELIEVERS WILT THOU FIND THE JEWS AND PAGANS  AND NEAREST AMONG THEM IN LOVE TO THE BELIEVERS WILT THOU FIND THOSE WHO SAY   WE ARE CHRISTIANS   BECAUSE AMONGST THESE ARE MEN DEVOTED TO LEARNING AND MEN WHO HAVE RENOUNCED THE WORLD AND THEY ARE NOT ARROGANT 
   AND WHEN THEY LISTEN TO THE REVELATION RECEIVED BY THE APOSTLE THOU WILT SEE THEIR EYES OVERFLOWING WITH TEARS FOR THEY RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH  THEY PRAY   OUR LORD  WE BELIEVE  WRITE US DOWN AMONG THE WITNESSES 
    WHAT CAUSE CAN WE HAVE NOT TO BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE TRUTH WHICH HAS COME TO US SEEING THAT WE LONG FOR OUR LORD TO ADMIT US TO THE COMPANY OF THE RIGHTEOUS  
   AND FOR THIS THEIR PRAYER HATH GOD REWARDED THEM WITH GARDENS WITH RIVERS FLOWING UNDERNEATH THEIR ETERNAL HOME  SUCH IS THE RECOMPENSE OF THOSE WHO DO GOOD 
   BUT THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH AND BELIE OUR SIGNS THEY SHALL BE COMPANIONS OF HELL FIRE SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  MAKE NOT UNLAWFUL THE GOOD THINGS WHICH GOD HATH MADE LAWFUL FOR YOU BUT COMMIT NO EXCESS  FOR GOD LOVETH NOT THOSE GIVEN TO EXCESS 
   EAT OF THE THINGS WHICH GOD HATH PROVIDED FOR YOU LAWFUL AND GOOD  BUT FEAR GOD IN WHOM YE BELIEVE 
   GOD WILL NOT CALL YOU TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT IS FUTILE IN YOUR OATHS BUT HE WILL CALL YOU TO ACCOUNT FOR YOUR DELIBERATE OATHS  FOR EXPIATION FEED THEN INDIGENT PERSONS ON A SCALE OF THE AVERAGE FOR THE FOOD OF YOUR FAMILIES  OR CLOTHE THEM  OR GIVE A SLAVE HIS FREEDOM  IF THAT IS BEYOND YOUR MEANS FAST FOR THREE DAYS  THAT IS THE EXPIATION FOR THE OATHS YE HAVE SWORN  BUT KEEP TO YOUR OATHS  THUS DOTH GOD MAKE CLEAR TO YOU HIS SIGNS THAT YE MAY BE GRATEFUL 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  INTOXICANTS AND GAMBLING  DEDICATION OF  STONES AND  DIVINATION BY  ARROWS ARE AN ABOMINATION OF SATAN S HANDIWORK  ESCHEW SUCH  ABOMINATION  THAT YE MAY PROSPER 
   SATAN S PLAN IS  BUT  TO EXCITE ENMITY AND HATRED BETWEEN YOU WITH INTOXICANTS AND GAMBLING AND HINDER YOU FROM THE REMEMBRANCE OF GOD AND FROM PRAYER  WILL YE NOT THEN ABSTAIN 
   OBEY GOD AND OBEY THE APOSTLE AND BEWARE  OF EVIL   IF YE DO TURN BACK KNOW YE THAT IT IS OUR APOSTLE S DUTY TO PROCLAIM  THE MESSAGE  IN THE CLEAREST MANNER 
   ON THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND DO DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS THERE IS NO BLAME FOR WHAT THEY ATE  IN THE PAST  WHEN THEY GUARD THEMSELVES FROM EVIL AND BELIEVE AND DO DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  OR  AGAIN GUARD THEMSELVES FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD  FOR GOD LOVETH THOSE WHO DO GOOD SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  GOD DOTH BUT MAKE A TRIAL OF YOU IN A LITTLE MATTER OF GAME WELL WITHIN REACH OF YOUR HANDS AND YOUR LANCES THAT HE MAY TEST WHO FEARETH HIM UNSEEN  ANY WHO TRANSGRESS THEREAFTER WILL HAVE A GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  KILL NOT GAME WHILE IN THE SACRED PRECINCTS OR IN PILGRIM GARB  IF ANY OF YOU DOTH SO INTENTIONALLY THE COMPENSATION IS AN OFFERING BROUGHT TO THE KA BA OF A DOMESTIC ANIMAL EQUIVALENT TO THE ONE HE KILLED AS ADJUDGED BY TWO JUST MEN AMONG YOU  OR BY WAY OF ATONEMENT THE FEEDING OF THE INDIGENT  OR ITS EQUIVALENT IN FASTS  THAT HE MAY TASTE OF THE PENALTY OF HIS DEED  GOD FORGIVES WHAT IS PAST  FOR REPETITION GOD WILL EXACT FROM HIM THE PENALTY  FOR GOD IS EXALTED AND LORD OF RETRIBUTION 
   LAWFUL TO YOU IS THE PURSUIT OF WATER GAME AND ITS USE FOR FOOD FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOURSELVES AND THOSE WHO TRAVEL  BUT FORBIDDEN IS THE PURSUIT OF LAND GAME  AS LONG AS YE ARE IN THE SACRED PRECINCTS OR IN PILGRIM GARB  AND FEAR GOD TO WHOM YE SHALL BE GATHERED BACK 
   GOD MADE THE KA BA THE SACRED HOUSE AN ASYLUM OF SECURITY FOR MEN AS ALSO THE SACRED MONTHS THE ANIMALS FOR OFFERINGS AND THE GARLANDS THAT MARK THEM  THAT YE MAY KNOW THAT GOD HATH KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH AND THAT GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THINGS 
   KNOW YE THAT GOD IS STRICT IN PUNISHMENT AND THAT GOD IS OFT  FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   THE APOSTLE S DUTY IS BUT TO PROCLAIM  THE MESSAGE   BUT GOD KNOWETH ALL THAT YE REVEAL AND YE CONCEAL 
   SAY   NOT EQUAL ARE THINGS THAT ARE BAD AND THINGS THAT ARE GOOD EVEN THOUGH THE ABUNDANCE OF THE BAD MAY DAZZLE THEE  SO FEAR GOD O YE THAT UNDERSTAND  THAT  SO  YE MAY PROSPER  SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  ASK NOT QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS WHICH IF MADE PLAIN TO YOU MAY CAUSE YOU TROUBLE  BUT IF YE ASK ABOUT THINGS WHEN THE QUR AN IS BEING REVEALED THEY WILL BE MADE PLAIN TO YOU  GOD WILL FORGIVE THOSE  FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST FORBEARING 
   SOME PEOPLE BEFORE YOU DID ASK SUCH QUESTIONS AND ON THAT ACCOUNT LOST THEIR FAITH 
   IT WAS NOT GOD WHO INSTITUTED  SUPERSTITIONS LIKE THOSE OF  A SLIT  EAR SHE CAMEL OR A SHE CAMEL LET LOOSE FOR FREE PASTURE OR IDOL SACRIFICES FOR TWIN BIRTHS IN ANIMALS OR STALLION CAMELS FREED FROM WORK  IT IS BLASPHEMERS WHO INVENT A LIE AGAINST GOD BUT MOST OF THEM LACK WISDOM 
   WHEN IT IS SAID TO THEM   COME TO WHAT GOD HATH REVEALED  COME TO THE APOSTLE   THEY SAY   ENOUGH FOR US ARE THE WAYS WE FOUND OUR FATHERS FOLLOWING   WHAT  EVEN THOUGH THEIR FATHERS WERE VOID OF KNOWLEDGE AND GUIDANCE  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  GUARD YOUR OWN SOULS  IF YE FOLLOW  RIGHT  GUIDANCE NO HURT CAN COME TO YOU FROM THOSE WHO STRAY  THE GOAL OF YOU ALL IS TO GOD  IT IS HE THAT WILL SHOW YOU THE TRUTH OF ALL THAT YE DO 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  WHEN DEATH APPROACHES ANY OF YOU  TAKE  WITNESSES AMONG YOURSELVES WHEN MAKING BEQUESTS TWO JUST MEN OF YOUR OWN  BROTHERHOOD  OR OTHERS FROM OUTSIDE IF YE ARE JOURNEYING THROUGH THE EARTH AND THE CHANCE OF DEATH BEFALLS YOU  THUS   IF YE DOUBT  THEIR TRUTH  DETAIN THEM BOTH AFTER PRAYER AND LET THEM BOTH SWEAR BY GOD   WE WISH NOT IN THIS FOR ANY WORLDLY GAIN EVEN THOUGH THE  BENEFICIARY  BE OUR NEAR RELATION  WE SHALL HIDE NOT THE EVIDENCE BEFORE GOD  IF WE DO THEN BEHOLD  THE SIN BE UPON US  
   BUT IF IT GETS KNOWN THAT THESE TWO WERE GUILTY OF THE SIN  OF PERJURY   LET TWO OTHERS STAND FORTH IN THEIR PLACES NEAREST IN KIN FROM AMONG THOSE WHO CLAIM A LAWFUL RIGHT  LET THEM SWEAR BY GOD   WE AFFIRM THAT OUR WITNESS IS TRUER THAN THAT OF THOSE TWO AND THAT WE HAVE NOT TRESPASSED  BEYOND THE TRUTH   IF WE DID BEHOLD  THE WRONG BE UPON US  
   THAT IS MOST SUITABLE  THAT THEY MAY GIVE THE EVIDENCE IN ITS TRUE NATURE AND SHAPE OR ELSE THEY WOULD FEAR THAT OTHER OATHS WOULD BE TAKEN AFTER THEIR OATHS  BUT FEAR GOD AND LISTEN  TO HIS COUNSEL   FOR GOD GUIDETH NOT A REBELLIOUS PEOPLE SECTION  
   ONE DAY WILL GOD GATHER THE APOSTLES TOGETHER AND ASK   WHAT WAS THE RESPONSE YE RECEIVED  FROM MEN TO YOUR TEACHING   THEY WILL SAY   WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE  IT IS THOU WHO KNOWEST IN FULL ALL THAT IS HIDDEN 
   THEN WILL GOD SAY   O JESUS THE SON OF MARY  RECOUNT MY FAVOR TO THEE AND TO THY MOTHER  BEHOLD  I STRENGTHENED THEE WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT SO THAT THOU DIDST SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE IN CHILDHOOD AND IN MATURITY  BEHOLD  I TAUGHT THEE THE BOOK AND WISDOM THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL  AND BEHOLD  THOU MAKEST OUT OF CLAY AS IT WERE THE FIGURE OF A BIRD BY MY LEAVE AND THOU BREATHEST INTO IT AND IT BECOMETH A BIRD BY MY LEAVE AND THOU HEALEST THOSE BORN BLIND AND THE LEPERS BY MY LEAVE  AND BEHOLD  THOU BRINGEST FORTH THE DEAD BY MY LEAVE  AND BEHOLD  I DID RESTRAIN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL FROM  VIOLENCE TO  THEE WHEN THOU DIDST SHOW THEM THE CLEAR SIGNS AND THE UNBELIEVERS AMONG THEM SAID   THIS IS NOTHING BUT EVIDENT MAGIC  
    AND BEHOLD  I INSPIRED THE DISCIPLES TO HAVE FAITH IN ME AND MINE APOSTLE  THEY SAID  WE HAVE FAITH AND DO THOU BEAR WITNESS THAT WE BOW TO GOD AS MUSLIMS   
   BEHOLD  THE DISCIPLES SAID   O JESUS THE SON OF MARY  CAN THY LORD SEND DOWN TO US A TABLE SET  WITH VIANDS  FROM HEAVEN   SAID JESUS   FEAR GOD IF YE HAVE FAITH 
   THEY SAID   WE ONLY WISH TO EAT THEREOF AND SATISFY OUR HEARTS AND TO KNOW THAT THOU HAST INDEED TOLD US THE TRUTH  AND THAT WE OURSELVES MAY BE WITNESSES TO THE MIRACLE 
   SAID JESUS THE SON OF MARY   O GOD OUR LORD  SEND US FROM HEAVEN A TABLE SET  WITH VIANDS  THAT THERE MAY BE FOR US FOR THE FIRST AND THE LAST OF US A SOLEMN FESTIVAL AND A SIGN FROM THEE  AND PROVIDE FOR OUR SUSTENANCE FOR THOU ART THE BEST SUSTAINER  OF OUR NEEDS  
   GOD SAID   I WILL SEND IT DOWN UNTO YOU  BUT IF ANY OF YOU AFTER THAT RESISTETH FAITH I WILL PUNISH HIM WITH A PENALTY SUCH AS I HAVE NOT INFLICTED ON ANYONE AMONG ALL THE PEOPLES SECTION  
   AND BEHOLD  GOD WILL SAY  O JESUS THE SON OF MARY  DIDST THOU SAY UNTO MEN  WORSHIP ME AND MY MOTHER AS GODS IN DEROGATION OF GOD   HE WILL SAY   GLORY TO THEE  NEVER COULD I SAY WHAT I HAD NO RIGHT  TO SAY   HAD I SAID SUCH A THING THOU WOULDST INDEED HAVE KNOWN IT  THOU KNOWEST WHAT IS IN MY HEART THOUGH I KNOW NOT WHAT IS IN THINE  FOR THOU KNOWEST IN FULL ALL THAT IS HIDDEN 
    NEVER SAID I TO THEM AUGHT EXCEPT WHAT THOU DIDST COMMAND ME TO SAY TO WIT  WORSHIP GOD MY LORD AND YOUR LORD   AND I WAS A WITNESS OVER THEM WHILST I DWELT AMONGST THEM  WHEN THOU DIDST TAKE ME UP THOU WAST THE WATCHER OVER THEM AND THOU ART A WITNESS TO ALL THINGS 
    IF THOU DOST PUNISH THEM THEY ARE THY SERVANTS  IF THOU DOST FORGIVE THEM THOU ART THE EXALTED THE WISE 
   GOD WILL SAY   THIS IS A DAY ON WHICH THE TRUTHFUL WILL PROFIT FROM THEIR TRUTH  THEIRS ARE GARDENS WITH RIVERS FLOWING BENEATH THEIR ETERNAL HOME  GOD WELL PLEASED WITH THEM AND THEY WITH GOD  THAT IS THE GREAT SALVATION  THE FULFILLMENT OF ALL DESIRES  
   TO GOD DOTH BELONG THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL THAT IS THEREIN AND IT IS HE WHO HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   PRAISE BE TO GOD WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND MADE THE DARKNESS AND THE LIGHT  YET THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH HOLD  OTHERS  AS EQUAL WITH THEIR GUARDIAN LORD 
   HE IT IS WHO CREATED YOU FROM CLAY AND THEN DECREED A STATED TERM  FOR YOU   AND THERE IS IN HIS PRESENCE ANOTHER DETERMINED TERM  YET YE DOUBT WITHIN YOURSELVES  
   AND HE IS GOD IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  HE KNOWETH WHAT YE HIDE AND WHAT YE REVEAL AND HE KNOWETH THE  RECOMPENSE  WHICH YE EARN  BY YOUR DEEDS  
   BUT NEVER DID A SINGLE ONE OF THE SIGNS OF THEIR LORD REACH THEM BUT THEY TURNED AWAY THEREFROM 
   AND NOW THEY REJECT THE TRUTH WHEN IT REACHES THEM  BUT SOON SHALL THEY LEARN THE REALITY OF WHAT THEY USED TO MOCK AT 
   SEE THEY NOT HOW MANY OF THOSE BEFORE THEM WE DID DESTROY  GENERATIONS WE HAD ESTABLISHED ON THE EARTH IN STRENGTH SUCH AS WE HAVE NOT GIVEN TO YOU FOR WHOM WE POURED OUT RAIN FROM THE SKIES IN ABUNDANCE AND GAVE  FERTILE  STREAMS FLOWING BENEATH THEIR  FEET   YET FOR THEIR SINS WE DESTROYED THEM AND RAISED IN THEIR WAKE FRESH GENERATIONS  TO SUCCEED THEM  
   IF WE HAD SENT UNTO THEE A WRITTEN  MESSAGE  ON PARCHMENT SO THAT THEY COULD TOUCH IT WITH THEIR HANDS THE UNBELIEVERS WOULD HAVE BEEN SURE TO SAY   THIS IS NOTHING BUT OBVIOUS MAGIC  
   THEY SAY   WHY IS NOT AN ANGEL SENT DOWN TO HIM   IF WE DID SEND DOWN AN ANGEL THE MATTER WOULD BE SETTLED AT ONCE AND NO RESPITE WOULD BE GRANTED THEM 
   IF WE HAD MADE IT AN ANGEL WE SHOULD HAVE SENT HIM AS A MAN AND WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE CAUSED THEM CONFUSION IN A MATTER WHICH THEY HAVE ALREADY COVERED WITH CONFUSION 
   MOCKED WERE  MANY  APOSTLES BEFORE THEE  BUT THE SCOFFERS WERE HEMMED IN BY THE THING THAT THEY MOCKED SECTION  
   SAY   TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH AND SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE WHO REJECTED TRUTH  
   SAY   TO WHOM BELONGETH ALL THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   SAY   TO GOD  HE HATH INSCRIBED FOR HIMSELF  THE RULE OF  MERCY THAT HE WILL GATHER YOU TOGETHER FOR THE DAY OF JUDGMENT THERE IS NO DOUBT WHATEVER  IT IS THEY WHO HAVE LOST THEIR OWN SOULS THAT WILL NOT BELIEVE 
    TO HIM BELONGETH ALL THAT DWELLETH  OR LURKETH  IN THE NIGHT AND THE DAY  FOR HE IS THE ONE WHO HEARETH AND KNOWETH ALL THINGS 
   SAY   SHALL I TAKE FOR MY PROTECTOR ANY OTHER THAN GOD THE MAKER OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND HE IS THAT FEEDETH BUT IS NOT FED   SAY   NAY  BUT I AM COMMANDED TO BE THE FIRST OF THOSE WHO BOW TO GOD  IN ISLAM  AND BE NOT THOU OF THE COMPANY OF THOSE WHO JOIN GODS WITH GOD  
   SAY   I WOULD IF I DISOBEYED MY LORD INDEED HAVE FEAR OF THE PENALTY OF A MIGHTY DAY 
    ON THAT DAY IF THE PENALTY IS AVERTED FROM ANY IT IS DUE TO GOD S MERCY  AND THAT WOULD BE  SALVATION  THE OBVIOUS FULFILLMENT OF ALL DESIRE 
    IF GOD TOUCH THEE WITH AFFLICTION NONE CAN REMOVE IT BUT HE  IF HE TOUCH THEE WITH HAPPINESS HE HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
    HE IS THE IRRESISTIBLE  WATCHING  FROM ABOVE OVER HIS WORSHIPPERS  AND HE IS THE WISE ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THINGS  
   SAY   WHAT THING IS MOST WEIGHTY IN EVIDENCE   SAY   GOD IS WITNESS BETWEEN ME AND YOU  THIS QUR AN HATH BEEN REVEALED TO ME BY INSPIRATION THAT I MAY WARN YOU AND ALL WHOM IT REACHES  CAN YE POSSIBLY BEAR WITNESS THAT BESIDES GOD THERE IS ANOTHER GOD   SAY   NAY  I CANNOT BEAR WITNESS   SAY   BUT IN TRUTH HE IS THE ONE GOD AND I TRULY AM INNOCENT OF  YOUR BLASPHEMY OF  JOINING OTHERS WITH HIM 
   THOSE TO WHOM WE HAVE GIVEN THE BOOK KNOW THIS AS THEY KNOW THEIR OWN SONS  THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR OWN SOULS REFUSE THEREFORE TO BELIEVE SECTION  
   WHO DOTH MORE WRONG THAN HE WHO INVENTETH A LIE AGAINST GOD OR REJECTETH HIS SIGNS  BUT VERILY THE WRONG DOERS NEVER SHALL PROSPER 
   ONE DAY SHALL WE GATHER THEM ALL TOGETHER  WE SHALL SAY TO THOSE WHO ASCRIBED PARTNERS  TO US    WHERE ARE THE PARTNERS WHOM YE  INVENTED AND  TALKED ABOUT  
   THERE WILL THEN BE  LEFT  NO SUBTERFUGE FOR THEM BUT TO SAY   BY GOD OUR LORD WE WERE NOT THOSE WHO JOINED GODS WITH GOD  
   BEHOLD  HOW THEY LIE AGAINST THEIR OWN SOULS  BUT THE  LIE  WHICH THEY INVENTED WILL LEAVE THEM IN THE LURCH 
   OF THEM THERE ARE SOME WHO  PRETEND TO  LISTEN TO THEE  BUT WE HAVE THROWN VEILS ON THEIR HEARTS SO THEY UNDERSTAND IT NOT AND DEAFNESS IN THEIR EARS  IF THEY SAW EVERY ONE OF THE SIGNS NOT THEY WILL BELIEVE IN THEM  IN SO MUCH THAT WHEN THEY COME TO THEE THEY  BUT  DISPUTE WITH THEE  THE UNBELIEVERS SAY   THESE ARE NOTHING BUT TALES OF THE ANCIENTS  
   OTHERS THEY KEEP AWAY FROM IT AND THEMSELVES THEY KEEP AWAY  BUT THEY ONLY DESTROY THEIR OWN SOULS AND THEY PERCEIVE IT NOT 
   IF THOU COULDST BUT SEE WHEN THEY ARE CONFRONTED WITH THE FIRE  THEY WILL SAY   WOULD THAT WE WERE BUT SENT BACK  THEN WOULD WE NOT REJECT THE SIGNS OF OUR LORD BUT WOULD BE AMONGST THOSE WHO BELIEVE  
   YEA IN THEIR OWN  EYES  WILL BECOME MANIFEST WHAT BEFORE THEY CONCEALED BUT IF THEY WERE RETURNED THEY WOULD CERTAINLY RELAPSE TO THE THINGS THEY WERE FORBIDDEN FOR THEY ARE INDEED LIARS 
   AND THEY  SOMETIMES  SAY   THERE IS NOTHING EXCEPT OUR LIFE ON THIS EARTH AND NEVER SHALL WE BE RAISED UP AGAIN  
   IF THOU COULDST BUT SEE WHEN THEY ARE CONFRONTED WITH THEIR LORD  HE WILL SAY   IS NOT THIS THE TRUTH   THEY WILL SAY   YEA BY OUR LORD   HE WILL SAY   TASTE YE THEN THE PENALTY BECAUSE YE REJECTED FAITH  SECTION  
   LOST INDEED ARE THEY WHO TREAT IT AS A FALSEHOOD THAT THEY MUST MEET GOD UNTIL ON A SUDDEN THE HOUR IS ON THEM AND THEY SAY   AH  WOE UNTO US THAT WE TOOK NO THOUGHT OF IT   FOR THEY BEAR THEIR BURDENS ON THEIR BACKS  AND EVIL INDEED ARE THE BURDENS THAT THEY BEAR  
   WHAT IS THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD BUT PLAY AND AMUSEMENT  BUT BEST IS THE HOME IN THE HEREAFTER FOR THOSE WHO ARE RIGHTEOUS  WILL YE NOT THEN UNDERSTAND 
   WE KNOW INDEED THE GRIEF WHICH THEIR WORDS DO CAUSE THEE  IT IS NOT THEE THEY REJECT  IT IS THE SIGNS OF GOD WHICH THE WICKED CONTEMN 
   REJECTED WERE THE APOSTLES BEFORE THEE  WITH PATIENCE AND CONSTANCY THEY BORE THEIR REJECTION AND THEIR WRONGS UNTIL OUR AID DID REACH THEM  THERE IS NONE THAT CAN ALTER THE WORDS  AND DECREES  OF GOD  ALREADY HAST THOU RECEIVED SOME ACCOUNT OF THOSE APOSTLES 
   IF THEIR SPURNING IS HARD ON THY MIND YET IF THOU WERT ABLE TO SEEK A TUNNEL IN THE GROUND OR A LADDER TO THE SKIES AND BRING THEM A SIGN  WHAT GOOD    IF IT WERE GOD S WILL HE COULD GATHER THEM TOGETHER UNTO TRUE GUIDANCE  SO BE NOT THOU AMONGST THOSE WHO ARE SWAYED BY IGNORANCE  AND IMPATIENCE  
   THOSE WHO LISTEN  IN TRUTH  BE SURE WILL ACCEPT  AS TO THE DEAD GOD WILL RAISE THEM UP  THEN WILL THEY BE TURNED UNTO HIM 
   THEY SAY   WHY IS NOT A SIGN SENT DOWN TO HIM FROM HIS LORD   SAY   GOD HATH CERTAINLY POWER TO SEND DOWN A SIGN  BUT MOST OF THEM UNDERSTAND NOT  
   THERE IS NOT AN ANIMAL  THAT LIVES  ON THE EARTH NOR A BEING THAT FLIES ON ITS WINGS BUT  FORMS PART OF  COMMUNITIES LIKE YOU  NOTHING HAVE WE OMITTED FROM THE BOOK AND THEY  ALL  SHALL BE GATHERED TO THEIR LORD IN THE END 
   THOSE WHO REJECT OUR SIGNS ARE DEAF AND DUMB IN THE MIDST OF DARKNESS PROFOUND  WHOM GOD WILLETH HE LEAVETH TO WANDER WHOM HE WILLETH HE PLACETH ON THE WAY THAT IS STRAIGHT 
   SAY   THINK YE TO YOURSELVES IF THERE COME UPON YOU THE WRATH OF GOD OR THE HOUR  THAT YE DREAD  WOULD YE THEN CALL UPON OTHER THAN GOD   REPLY  IF YE ARE TRUTHFUL 
    NAY ON HIM WOULD YE CALL AND IF IT BE HIS WILL HE WOULD REMOVE  THE DISTRESS  WHICH OCCASIONED YOUR CALL UPON HIM AND YE WOULD FORGET  THE FALSE GODS  WHICH YE JOIN WITH HIM  SECTION  
   BEFORE THEE WE SENT  APOSTLES  TO MANY NATIONS AND WE AFFLICTED THE NATIONS WITH SUFFERING AND ADVERSITY THAT THEY MIGHT LEARN HUMILITY 
   WHEN THE SUFFERING REACHED THEM FROM US WHY THEN DID THEY NOT LEARN HUMILITY  ON THE CONTRARY THEIR HEARTS BECAME HARDENED AND SATAN MADE THEIR  SINFUL  ACTS SEEM ALLURING TO THEM 
   BUT WHEN THEY FORGET THE WARNING THEY HAD RECEIVED WE OPENED TO THEM THE GATES OF ALL  GOOD  THINGS UNTIL IN THE MIDST OF THEIR ENJOYMENT OF OUR GIFTS ON A SUDDEN WE CALLED THEM TO ACCOUNT WHEN LO  THEY WERE PLUNGED IN DESPAIR 
   OF THE WRONG DOERS THE LAST REMNANT WAS CUT OFF  PRAISE BE TO GOD THE CHERISHER OF THE WORLDS
   SAY   THINK YE IF GOD TOOK AWAY YOUR HEARING AND YOUR SIGHT AND SEALED UP YOUR HEARTS WHO A GOD OTHER THAN GOD COULD RESTORE THEM TO YOU  SEE HOW WE EXPLAIN THE SIGNS BY VARIOUS  SYMBOLS   YET THEY TURN ASIDE 
   SAY   THINK YE IF THE PUNISHMENT OF GOD COMES TO YOU WHETHER SUDDENLY OR OPENLY WILL ANY BE DESTROYED EXCEPT THOSE WHO DO WRONG  
   WE SEND THE APOSTLES ONLY TO GIVE GOOD NEWS AND TO WARN  SO THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND MEND  THEIR LIVES  UPON THEM SHALL BE NO FEAR NOR SHALL THEY GRIEVE 
   BUT THOSE WHO REJECT OUR SIGNS THEM SHALL OUR PUNISHMENT TOUCH FOR THAT THEY CEASED NOT FROM TRANSGRESSING 
   SAY   I TELL YOU NOT THAT WITH ME ARE THE TREASURES OF GOD NOR DO I KNOW WHAT IS HIDDEN NOR DO I TELL YOU I AM AN ANGEL  I BUT FOLLOW WHAT IS REVEALED TO ME   SAY   CAN THE BLIND BE HELD EQUAL TO THE SEEING   WILL YE THEN CONSIDER NOT SECTION

   SEND NOT AWAY THOSE WHO CALL ON THEIR LORD MORNING AND EVENING SEEKING HIS FACE  NAUGHT HAVE THEY TO GAIN FROM THEE AND NAUGHT HAST THOU TO GAIN FROM THEM THAT THOU SHOULDST TURN THEM AWAY AND THUS BE  ONE  OF THE UNJUST 
   THUS DID WE TRY SOME OF THEM BY COMPARISON WITH OTHERS THAT THEY SHOULD SAY  IS IT THESE THEN THAT GOD HATH FAVORED FROM AMONGST US   DOTH NOT GOD KNOW BEST THOSE WHO ARE GRATEFUL  
   WHEN THOSE COME TO THEE WHO BELIEVE IN OUR SIGNS SAY   PEACE BE ON YOU  YOUR LORD HAD INSCRIBED FOR HIMSELF  THE RULE OF  MERCY  VERILY IF ANY OF YOU DID EVIL IN IGNORANCE AND THEREAFTER REPENTED AND AMENDED  HIS CONDUCT  LO  HE IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL

   SAY   I AM FORBIDDEN TO WORSHIP THOSE OTHER THAN GOD WHOM YE CALL UPON   SAY   I WILL NOT FOLLOW YOUR VAIN DESIRES  IF I DID I WOULD STRAY FROM THE PATH AND BE NOT OF THE COMPANY OF THOSE WHO RECEIVE GUIDANCE  
   SAY   FOR ME I  WORK  ON A CLEAR SIGN FROM MY LORD BUT YE REJECT HIM  WHAT YE WOULD SEE HASTENED IS NOT IN MY POWER  THE COMMAND RESTS WITH NONE BUT GOD  HE DECLARES THE TRUTH AND HE IS THE BEST OF JUDGES  
   SAY   IF WHAT YE WOULD SEE HASTENED WERE IN MY POWER THE MATTER WOULD BE SETTLED AT ONCE BETWEEN YOU AND ME  BUT GOD KNOWETH BEST THOSE WHO DO WRONG  
   WITH HIM ARE THE KEYS OF THE UNSEEN THE TREASURES THAT NONE KNOWETH BUT HE  HE KNOWETH WHATEVER THERE IS ON THE EARTH AND IN THE SEA  NOT A LEAF DOTH FALL BUT WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE  THERE IS NOT A GRAIN IN THE DARKNESS  OR DEPTHS  OF THE EARTH NOR ANYTHING FRESH OR DRY  GREEN OR WITHERED  BUT IS  INSCRIBED  IN A RECORD CLEAR  TO THOSE WHO CAN READ  
   IT IS HE WHO DOTH TAKE YOUR SOULS BY NIGHT AND HATH KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THAT YE HAVE DONE BY DAY  BY DAY DOTH HE RAISE YOU UP AGAIN  THAT A TERM APPOINTED BE FULFILLED  IN THE END UNTO HIM WILL BE YOUR RETURN THEN WILL HE SHOW YOU THE TRUTH OF ALL THAT YE DID SECTION  
   HE IS THE IRRESISTIBLE  WATCHING  FROM ABOVE OVER HIS WORSHIPPERS AND HE SETS GUARDIANS OVER YOU  AT LENGTH WHEN DEATH APPROACHES ONE OF YOU OUR ANGELS TAKE HIS SOUL AND THEY NEVER FAIL IN THEIR DUTY 
   THEN ARE MEN RETURNED UNTO GOD THEIR PROTECTOR THE  ONLY  REALITY  IS NOT HIS THE COMMAND  AND HE IS THE SWIFTEST IN TAKING ACCOUNT 
   SAY   WHO IS IT THAT DELIVERETH YOU FROM THE DARK RECESSES OF LAND AND SEA WHEN YE CALL UPON HIM IN HUMILITY AND SILENT TERROR   IF HE ONLY DELIVERS US FROM THESE  DANGERS   WE VOW  WE SHALL TRULY SHOW OUR GRATITUDE

   BUT THY PEOPLE REJECT THIS THOUGH IT IS THE TRUTH  SAY   NOT MINE IS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ARRANGING YOUR AFFAIRS 
    FOR EVERY MESSAGE IS A LIMIT OF TIME AND SOON SHALL YE KNOW IT  
   WHEN THOU SEEST MEN ENGAGED IN VAIN DISCOURSE ABOUT OUR SIGNS TURN AWAY FROM THEM UNLESS THEY TURN TO A DIFFERENT THEME  IF SATAN EVER MAKES THEE FORGET THEN AFTER RECOLLECTION SIT NOT THOU IN THE COMPANY OF THE UNGODLY 
   ON THEIR ACCOUNT NO RESPONSIBILITY FALLS ON THE RIGHTEOUS BUT  THEIR DUTY  IS TO REMIND THEM THAT THEY MAY  LEARN TO  FEAR GOD 
   LEAVE ALONE THOSE WHO TAKE THEIR RELIGION TO BE MERE PLAY AND AMUSEMENT AND ARE DECEIVED BY THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD  BUT PROCLAIM  TO THEM  THIS  TRUTH   THAT EVERY SOUL DELIVERS ITSELF TO RUIN BY ITS OWN ACTS  IT WILL FIND FOR ITSELF NO PROTECTOR OR INTERCESSOR EXCEPT GOD  IF IT OFFERED EVERY RANSOM  OR REPARATION  NONE WILL BE ACCEPTED  SUCH IS  THE END OF  THOSE WHO DELIVER THEMSELVES TO RUIN BY THEIR OWN ACTS  THEY WILL HAVE FOR DRINK  ONLY  BOILING WATER AND FOR PUNISHMENT ONE MOST GRIEVOUS  FOR THEY PERSISTED IN REJECTING GOD SECTION  
   SAY   SHALL WE INDEED CALL ON OTHERS BESIDES GOD THINGS THAT CAN DO US NEITHER GOOD NOR HARM AND TURN ON OUR HEELS AFTER RECEIVING GUIDANCE FROM GOD  LIKE ONE WHOM THE EVIL ONES HAVE MADE INTO A FOOL WANDERING BEWILDERED THROUGH THE EARTH HIS FRIENDS CALLING  COME TO US   VAINLY  GUIDING HIM TO THE PATH   SAY   GOD S GUIDANCE IS THE  ONLY  GUIDANCE AND WE HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO SUBMIT OURSELVES TO THE LORD OF THE WORLDS 
    TO ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS AND TO FEAR GOD  FOR IT IS TO HIM THAT WE SHALL BE GATHERED TOGETHER  
   IT IS HE WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH IN TRUE  PROPORTIONS   THE DAY HE SAITH  BE  BEHOLD  IT IS  HIS WORD IS THE TRUTH  HIS WILL BE THE DOMINION THE DAY THE TRUMPET WILL BE BLOWN  HE KNOWETH THE UNSEEN AS WELL AS THAT WHICH IS OPEN  FOR HE IS THE WISE WELL ACQUAINTED  WITH ALL THINGS  
   LO  ABRAHAM SAID TO HIS FATHER AZAR   TAKEST THOU IDOLS FOR GODS  FOR I SEE THEE AND THY PEOPLE IN MANIFEST ERROR  
   SO ALSO DID WE SHOW ABRAHAM THE POWER AND THE LAWS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH THAT HE MIGHT  WITH UNDERSTANDING  HAVE CERTITUDE 
   WHEN THE NIGHT COVERED HIM OVER HE SAW A STAR  HE SAID   THIS IS MY LORD   BUT WHEN IT SET HE SAID   I LOVE NOT THOSE THAT SET  
   WHEN HE SAW THE MOON RISING IN SPLENDOR HE SAID   THIS IS MY LORD   BUT WHEN THE MOON SET HE SAID   UNLESS MY LORD GUIDE ME I SHALL SURELY BE AMONG THOSE WHO GO ASTRAY  
   WHEN HE SAW THE SUN RISING IN SPLENDOR HE SAID   THIS IS MY LORD  THIS IS THE GREATEST  OF ALL    BUT WHEN THE SUN SET HE SAID   O MY PEOPLE  I AM  NOW  FREE FROM YOUR  GUILT  OF GIVING PARTNERS TO GOD 
    FOR ME I HAVE SET MY FACE FIRMLY AND TRULY TOWARD HIM WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND NEVER SHALL I GIVE PARTNERS TO GOD  
   HIS PEOPLE DISPUTED WITH HIM  HE SAID    COME  YE TO DISPUTE WITH ME ABOUT GOD WHEN HE  HIMSELF  HATH GUIDED ME  I FEAR NOT  THE BEINGS  YE ASSOCIATE WITH GOD  UNLESS MY LORD WILLETH  NOTHING CAN HAPPEN   MY LORD COMPREHENDETH IN HIS KNOWLEDGE ALL THINGS  WILL YE NOT  YOURSELVES  BE ADMONISHED  
    HOW SHOULD I FEAR  THE BEINGS  YE ASSOCIATE WITH GOD WHEN YE FEAR NOT TO GIVE PARTNERS TO GOD WITHOUT ANY WARRANT HAVING BEEN GIVEN TO YOU  WHICH OF  US  TWO PARTIES HATH MORE RIGHT TO SECURITY   TELL ME  IF YE KNOW 
    IT IS THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND CONFUSE NOT THEIR BELIEFS WITH WRONG THAT ARE  TRULY  IN SECURITY FOR THEY ARE ON  RIGHT  GUIDANCE  SECTION  
   THAT WAS THE REASONING ABOUT US WHICH WE GAVE TO ABRAHAM  TO USE  AGAINST HIS PEOPLE  WE RAISE WHOM WE WILL DEGREE AFTER DEGREE  FOR THY LORD IS FULL OF WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE 
   WE GAVE HIM ISAAC AND JACOB  ALL  THREE  WE GUIDED  AND BEFORE HIM  WE GUIDED NOAH  AND AMONG HIS PROGENY  DAVID  SOLOMON  JOB  JOSEPH  MOSES  AND AARON  THUS DO WE REWARD THOSE WHO DO GOOD 
   AND ZAKARIYA AND JOHN AND JESUS AND ELIAS  ALL IN THE RANKS OF THE RIGHTEOUS 
   AND ISMAIL AND ELISHA AND JONAHS AND LOT  AND TO ALL WE GAVE FAVOR ABOVE THE NATIONS 
    TO THEM  AND TO THEIR FATHERS AND PROGENY AND BRETHREN  WE CHOSE THEM  AND WE GUIDED THEM TO A STRAIGHT WAY 
   THIS IS THE GUIDANCE OF GOD  HE GIVETH THAT GUIDANCE TO WHOM HE PLEASETH OF HIS WORSHIPPERS  IF THEY WERE TO JOIN OTHER GODS WITH HIM ALL THAT THEY DID WOULD BE VAIN FOR THEM 
   THESE WERE THE MEN TO WHOM WE GAVE THE BOOK AND AUTHORITY AND PROPHETHOOD  IF THESE  THEIR DESCENDANTS  REJECT THEM BEHOLD  WE SHALL ENTRUST THEIR CHARGE TO A NEW PEOPLE WHO REJECT THEM NOT 
   THOSE WERE THE  PROPHETS  WHO RECEIVED GOD S GUIDANCE  COPY THE GUIDANCE THEY RECEIVED  SAY   NO REWARD FOR THIS DO I ASK OF YOU  THIS IS NO LESS THAN A MESSAGE FOR THE NATIONS  SECTION  
   NO JUST ESTIMATE OF GOD DO THEY MAKE WHEN THEY SAY   NOTHING DOTH GOD SEND DOWN TO MAN  BY WAY OF REVELATION    SAY   WHO THEN SENT DOWN THE BOOK WHICH MOSES BROUGHT  A LIGHT AND GUIDANCE TO MAN  BUT YE MAKE IT INTO  SEPARATE  SHEETS FOR SHOW WHILE YE CONCEAL MUCH  OF ITS CONTENTS   THEREIN WERE YE TAUGHT THAT WHICH YE KNEW NOT NEITHER YE NOR YOUR FATHERS   SAY   GOD  SENT IT DOWN    THEN LEAVE THEM TO PLUNGE IN VAIN DISCOURSE AND TRIFLING 
   AND THIS IS A BOOK WHICH WE HAVE REVEALED BRINGING BLESSINGS AND CONFIRMING  THE REVELATIONS  WHICH CAME BEFORE IT  THAT THOU MAYEST WARN THE MOTHER OF CITIES AND ALL AROUND HER  THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THE HEREAFTER BELIEVE IN THIS  BOOK  AND THEY ARE CONSTANT IN GUARDING THEIR PRAYERS 
   WHO CAN BE MORE WICKED THAN ONE WHO INVENTETH A LIE AGAINST GOD OR SAITH  I HAVE RECEIVED INSPIRATION  WHEN HE HATH RECEIVED NONE OR  AGAIN  WHO SAITH  I CAN REVEAL THE LIKE OF WHAT GOD HATH REVEALED   IF THOU COULDST BUT SEE HOW THE WICKED  DO FARE  IN THE FLOOD OF CONFUSION AT DEATH  THE ANGELS STRETCH FORTH THEIR HANDS  SAYING   YIELD UP YOUR SOULS  THIS DAY SHALL YE RECEIVE YOUR REWARD A PENALTY OF SHAME FOR THAT YE USED TO TELL LIES AGAINST GOD AND SCORNFULLY TO REJECT OF HIS SIGNS  
    AND BEHOLD  YE COME TO US BARE AND ALONE AS WE CREATED YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME  YE HAVE LEFT BEHIND YOU ALL  THE FAVORS  WHICH WE BESTOWED ON YOU  WE SEE NOT WITH YOU YOUR INTERCESSORS WHOM YE THOUGHT TO BE PARTNERS IN YOUR AFFAIRS  SO NOW ALL RELATIONS BETWEEN YOU HAVE BEEN CUT OFF AND YOUR  PET  FANCIES HAVE LEFT YOU IN THE LURCH  SECTION  
   IT IS GOD WHO CAUSETH THE SEED GRAIN AND THE DATE STONE TO SPLIT AND SPROUT  HE CAUSETH THE LIVING TO ISSUE FROM THE DEAD AND HE IS THE ONE TO CAUSE THE DEAD TO ISSUE FROM THE LIVING  THAT IS GOD  THEN HOW ARE YE DELUDED AWAY FROM THE TRUTH 
   HE IT IS THAT CLEAVETH THE DAYBREAK  FROM THE DARK   HE MAKES THE NIGHT FOR REST AND TRANQUILLITY AND THE SUN AND MOON FOR THE RECKONING  OF TIME   SUCH IS THE JUDGMENT AND ORDERING OF  HIM  THE EXALTED IN POWER THE OMNISCIENT 
   IT IS HE WHO MAKETH THE STARS  AS BEACONS  FOR YOU THAT YE MAY GUIDE YOURSELVES WITH THEIR HELP THROUGH THE DARK SPACES OF LAND AND SEA  WE DETAIL OUR SIGNS FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW

   YET THEY MAKE THE JINNS EQUALS WITH GOD THOUGH GOD DID CREATE THE JINNS  AND THEY FALSELY HAVING NO KNOWLEDGE ATTRIBUTE TO HIM SONS AND DAUGHTERS  PRAISE AND GLORY BE TO HIM   FOR HE IS  ABOVE WHAT THEY ATTRIBUTE TO HIM  SECTION  
   TO HIM IS DUE THE PRIMAL ORIGIN OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  HOW CAN HE HAVE A SON WHEN HE HATH NO CONSORT  HE CREATED ALL THINGS AND HE HATH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THINGS 
   THAT IS GOD YOUR LORD  THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE THE CREATOR OF ALL THINGS  THEN WORSHIP YE HIM  AND HE HATH POWER TO DISPOSE OF ALL AFFAIRS 
   NO VISION CAN GRASP HIM BUT HIS GRASP IS OVER ALL VISION  HE IS ABOVE ALL COMPREHENSION YET IS ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THINGS

   FOLLOW WHAT THOU ART TAUGHT BY INSPIRATION FROM THY LORD  THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE  AND TURN ASIDE FROM THOSE WHO JOIN GODS WITH GOD 
   IF IT HAD BEEN GOD S PLAN THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN FALSE GODS  BUT WE MADE THEE NOT ONE TO WATCH OVER THEIR DOINGS NOR ART THOU SET OVER THEM TO DISPOSE OF THEIR AFFAIRS 
   REVILE NOT YE THOSE WHOM THEY CALL UPON BESIDES GOD LEST THEY OUT OF SPITE REVILE GOD IN THEIR IGNORANCE  THUS HAVE WE MADE ALLURING TO EACH PEOPLE ITS OWN DOINGS  IN THE END WILL THEY RETURN TO THEIR LORD AND WE SHALL THEN TELL THEM THE TRUTH OF ALL THAT THEY DID 
   THEY SWEAR THEIR STRONGEST OATHS BY GOD THAT IF A  SPECIAL  SIGN CAME TO THEM BY IT THEY WOULD BELIEVE  SAY   CERTAINLY  ALL  SIGNS ARE IN THE POWER OF GOD  BUT WHAT WILL MAKE YOU  MUSLIMS  REALIZE THAT EVEN IF A  SPECIAL  SIGN COMES THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE  
   WE  TOO  SHALL TURN TO  CONFUSION  THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR EYES EVEN AS THEY REFUSED TO BELIEVE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE  WE SHALL LEAVE THEM IN THEIR TRESPASSES TO WANDER IN DISTRACTION SECTION  
   EVEN IF WE DID SEND UNTO THEM ANGELS AND THE DEAD DID SPEAK UNTO THEM AND WE GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THINGS BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES THEY ARE NOT THE ONES TO BELIEVE UNLESS IT IS IN GOD S PLAN  BUT MOST OF THEM IGNORE  THE TRUTH  
   LIKEWISE DID WE MAKE FOR EVERY MESSENGER AN ENEMY EVIL ONES AMONG MEN AND JINNS INSPIRING EACH OTHER WITH FLOWERY DISCOURSES BY WAY OF DECEPTION  IF THY LORD HAD SO PLANNED THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IT  SO LEAVE THEM AND THEIR INVENTIONS ALONE

   BUT WE SAVED HIM AND HIS FAMILY EXCEPT HIS WIFE  SHE WAS OF THOSE WHO LAGGED BEHIND 
   AND WE RAINED DOWN ON THEM A SHOWER  OF BRIMSTONE   THEN SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE WHO INDULGED IN SIN AND CRIME SECTION  
   TO THE MADYAN PEOPLE WE SENT SHU AIB ONE OF THEIR OWN BRETHREN  HE SAID   O MY PEOPLE  WORSHIP GOD  YE HAVE NO OTHER GOD BUT HIM  NOW HATH COME UNTO YOU A CLEAR  SIGN  FROM YOUR LORD  GIVE JUST MEASURE AND WEIGHT NOR WITHHOLD FROM THE PEOPLE THE THINGS THAT ARE THEIR DUE  AND DO NO MISCHIEF ON THE EARTH AFTER IT HAS BEEN SET IN ORDER  THAT WILL BE BEST FOR YOU IF YE HAVE FAITH 
    AND SQUAT NOT ON EVERY ROAD BREATHING THREATS HINDERING FROM THE PATH OF GOD THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN HIM AND SEEKING IN IT SOMETHING CROOKED  BUT REMEMBER HOW YE WERE LITTLE AND HE GAVE YOU INCREASE  AND HOLD IN YOUR MIND S EYE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE WHO DID MISCHIEF 
    AND IF THERE IS A PARTY AMONG YOU WHO BELIEVES IN THE MESSAGE WITH WHICH I HAVE BEEN SENT AND A PARTY WHICH DOES NOT BELIEVE HOLD YOURSELVES IN PATIENCE UNTIL GOD DOTH DECIDE BETWEEN US  FOR HE IS THE BEST TO DECIDE  
   THE LEADERS THE ARROGANT PARTY AMONG HIS PEOPLE SAID   O SHU AIB  WE SHALL CERTAINLY DRIVE THEE OUT OF OUR CITY  THEE  AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE WITH THEE  OR ELSE YE  THOU AND THEY  SHALL HAVE TO RETURN TO OUR WAYS AND RELIGION   HE SAID   WHAT  EVEN THOUGH WE DO DETEST  THEM  
    WE SHOULD INDEED INVENT A LIE AGAINST GOD IF WE RETURNED TO YOUR WAYS AFTER GOD HATH RESCUED US THEREFROM  NOR COULD WE BY ANY MANNER OF MEANS RETURN THERETO UNLESS IT BE AS IN THE WILL AND PLAN OF GOD OUR LORD  OUR LORD CAN REACH OUT TO THE UTMOST RECESSES OF THINGS BY HIS KNOWLEDGE  IN GOD IS OUR TRUST  OUR LORD  DECIDE THOU BETWEEN US AND OUR PEOPLE IN TRUTH FOR THOU ART THE BEST TO DECIDE  
   THE LEADERS THE UNBELIEVERS AMONG HIS PEOPLE SAID  IF YE FOLLOW SHU AIB BE SURE THEN YE ARE RUINED  
   BUT THE EARTHQUAKE TOOK THEM UNAWARES AND THEY LAY PROSTRATE IN THEIR HOMES BEFORE THE MORNING 
   THE MEN WHO REJECTED SHU AIB BECAME AS IF THEY HAD NEVER BEEN IN THE HOMES WHERE THEY HAD FLOURISHED  THE MEN WHO REJECTED SHU AIB IT WAS THEY WHO WERE RUINED 
   SO SHU AIB LEFT THEM SAYING   O MY PEOPLE  I DID INDEED CONVEY TO YOU THE MESSAGES FOR WHICH I WAS SENT BY MY LORD  I GAVE YOU GOOD COUNSEL BUT HOW SHALL I LAMENT OVER A PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO BELIEVE SECTION  
   WHENEVER WE SENT A PROPHET TO A TOWN WE TOOK UP ITS PEOPLE IN SUFFERING AND ADVERSITY IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT LEARN HUMILITY 
   THEN WE CHANGED THEIR SUFFERING INTO PROSPERITY UNTIL THEY GREW AND MULTIPLIED AND BEGAN TO SAY   OUR FATHERS  TOO  WERE TOUCHED BY SUFFERING AND AFFLUENCE    BEHOLD  WE CALLED THEM TO ACCOUNT OF A SUDDEN WHILE THEY REALIZED NOT  THEIR PERIL  
   IF THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWNS HAD BUT BELIEVED AND FEARED GOD WE SHOULD INDEED HAVE OPENED OUT TO THEM  ALL KINDS OF  BLESSINGS FROM HEAVEN AND EARTH  BUT THEY REJECTED  THE TRUTH  AND WE BROUGHT THEM TO BOOK FOR THEIR MISDEEDS 
   DID THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWNS FEEL SECURE AGAINST THE COMING OF OUR WRATH BY NIGHT WHILE THEY WERE ASLEEP 
   OR ELSE DID THEY FEEL SECURE AGAINST ITS COMING IN BROAD DAYLIGHT WHILE THEY PLAYED ABOUT  CARE FREE  
   DID THEY THEN FELL SECURE AGAINST THE PLAN OF GOD  BUT NO ONE CAN FEEL SECURE FROM THE PLAN OF GOD EXCEPT THOSE  DOOMED  TO RUIN SECTION  
   TO THOSE WHO INHERIT THE EARTH IN SUCCESSION TO ITS  PREVIOUS  POSSESSORS IS IT NOT A GUIDING  LESSON  THAT IF WE SO WILLED WE COULD PUNISH THEM  TOO  FOR THEIR SINS AND SEAL UP THEIR HEARTS SO THAT THEY COULD NOT HEAR 
   SUCH WERE THE TOWNS WHOSE STORY WE  THUS  RELATE UNTO THEE  THERE CAME INDEED TO THEM THEIR APOSTLES WITH CLEAR  SIGNS   BUT THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY HAD REJECTED BEFORE  THUS DOTH GOD SEAL UP THE HEART OF THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH 
   MOST OF THEM WE FOUND NOT MEN  TRUE  TO THEIR COVENANT  BUT MOST OF THEM WE FOUND REBELLIOUS AND DISOBEDIENT 
   THEN AFTER THEM WE SENT MOSES WITH OUR SIGNS TO PHARAOH AND HIS CHIEFS BUT THEY WRONGFULLY REJECTED THEM  SO SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE WHO MADE MISCHIEF 
   MOSES SAID   O PHARAOH  I AM AN APOSTLE FROM THE LORD OF THE WORLDS 
    ONE FOR WHOM IT IS RIGHT TO SAY NOTHING BUT TRUTH ABOUT GOD  NOW HAVE I COME UNTO YOU  PEOPLE  FROM YOUR LORD WITH A CLEAR  SIGN   SO LET THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DEPART ALONG WITH ME  
    PHARAOH  SAID   IF INDEED THOU HAST COME WITH A SIGN SHOW IT FORTH IF THOU TELLEST THE TRUTH  
   THEN  MOSES  THREW HIS ROD AND BEHOLD  IT WAS A SERPENT PLAIN  FOR ALL TO SEE  
   AND HE DREW OUT HIS HAND AND BEHOLD  IT WAS WHITE TO ALL BEHOLDERS SECTION  
   SAID THE CHIEFS OF THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH   THIS IS INDEED A SORCERER WELL VERSED 
    HIS PLAN IS TO GET YOU OUT OF YOUR LAND THEN WHAT IS IT YE COUNSEL  
   THEY SAID   KEEP HIM AND HIS BROTHER IN SUSPENSE  FOR A WHILE   AND SEND TO THE CITIES MEN TO COLLECT
   AND BRING UP TO THEE ALL  OUR  SORCERERS WELL VERSED  
   SO THERE CAME THE SORCERERS TO PHARAOH  THEY SAID  OF COURSE WE SHALL HAVE A  SUITABLE  REWARD IF WE WIN  
   HE SAID   YEA  AND MORE  FOR YE SHALL IN THAT CASE BE  RAISED TO POSTS  NEAREST  TO MY PERSON   
   THEY SAID   O MOSES  WILT THOU THROW  FIRST  OR SHALL WE HAVE THE  FIRST  THROW  
   SAID MOSES   THROW YE  FIRST    SO WHEN THEY THREW THEY BEWITCHED THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE AND STRUCK TERROR INTO THEM  FOR THEY SHOWED A GREAT  FEAT OF  MAGIC 
   WE PUT IT INTO MOSES S MIND BY INSPIRATION   THROW  NOW  THY ROD   AND BEHOLD  IT SWALLOWS UP STRAIGHTWAY ALL THE FALSEHOODS WHICH THEY FAKE 
   THUS TRUTH WAS CONFIRMED AND ALL THAT THEY DID WAS MADE OF NO EFFECT 
   SO THE  GREAT ONES  WERE VANQUISHED THERE AND THEN AND WERE MADE TO LOOK SMALL 
   BUT THE SORCERERS FELL DOWN PROSTRATE IN ADORATION 
   SAYING   WE BELIEVE IN THE LORD OF THE WORLDS 
    THE LORD OF MOSES AND AARON  
   SAID PHARAOH   BELIEVE YE IN HIM BEFORE I GIVE YOU PERMISSION  SURELY THIS IS A TRICK WHICH YE HAVE PLANNED IN THE CITY TO DRIVE OUT ITS PEOPLE  BUT SOON SHALL YE KNOW  THE CONSEQUENCES  
    BE SURE I WILL CUT OFF YOUR HANDS AND YOUR FEET ON OPPOSITE SIDES AND I WILL CAUSE YOU ALL TO DIE ON THE CROSS  
   THEY SAID   FOR US WE ARE BUT SENT BACK UNTO OUR LORD 
    BUT THOU DOST WREAK THY VENGEANCE ON US SIMPLY BECAUSE WE BELIEVED IN THE SIGNS OF OUR LORD WHEN THEY REACHED US  OUR LORD  POUR OUT ON US PATIENCE AND CONSTANCY AND TAKE OUR SOULS UNTO THEE AS MUSLIMS  WHO BOW TO THY WILL   SECTION  
   SAID THE CHIEFS OF PHARAOH S PEOPLE   WILT THOU LEAVE MOSES AND HIS PEOPLE TO SPREAD MISCHIEF IN THE LAND AND TO ABANDON THEE AND THY GODS   HE SAID   THEIR MALE CHILDREN WILL WE SLAY   ONLY  THEIR FEMALES WILL WE SAVE ALIVE  AND WE HAVE OVER THEM  POWER  IRRESISTIBLE  
   SAID MOSES TO HIS PEOPLE   PRAY FOR HELP FROM GOD AND  WAIT  IN PATIENCE AND CONSTANCY  FOR THE EARTH IS GOD S TO GIVE AS A HERITAGE TO SUCH OF HIS SERVANTS AS HE PLEASETH  AND THE END IS  BEST  FOR THE RIGHTEOUS 
   THEY SAID   WE HAVE HAD  NOTHING BUT  TROUBLE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THOU COMEST TO US   HE SAID   IT MAY BE THAT YOUR LORD WILL DESTROY YOUR ENEMY AND MAKE YOU INHERITORS IN THE EARTH  THAT SO HE MAY TRY YOU BY YOUR DEEDS  SECTION  
   WE PUNISHED THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH WITH YEARS  OF DROUGHT  AND SHORTNESS OF CROPS  THAT THEY MIGHT RECEIVE ADMONITION 
   BUT WHEN GOOD  TIMES  CAME THEY SAID  THIS IS DUE TO US   WHEN GRIPPED BY CALAMITY THEY ASCRIBED IT TO EVIL OMENS CONNECTED WITH MOSES AND THOSE WITH HIM  BEHOLD  IN TRUTH THE OMENS OF EVIL ARE THEIRS IN GOD S SIGHT BUT MOST OF THEM DO NOT UNDERSTAND 
   THEY SAID  TO MOSES    WHATEVER BE THE SIGNS THOU BRINGEST TO WORK THEREWITH THE SORCERY ON US WE SHALL NEVER BELIEVE IN THEE  
   SO WE SENT  PLAGUES  ON THEM WHOLESALE DEATH LOCUSTS LICE FROGS AND BLOOD  SIGNS OPENLY SELF EXPLAINED  BUT THEY WERE STEEPED IN ARROGANCE A PEOPLE GIVEN TO SIN 
   EVERY TIME THE PENALTY FELL ON THEM THEY SAID   O MOSES  ON OUR BEHALF CALL ON THY LORD IN VIRTUE OF HIS PROMISE TO THEE  IF THOU WILT REMOVE THE PENALTY FROM US WE SHALL TRULY BELIEVE IN THEE AND WE SHALL SEND AWAY THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WITH THEE  
   BUT EVERY TIME WE REMOVED THE PENALTY FROM THEM ACCORDING TO A FIXED TERM WHICH THEY HAD TO FULFIL BEHOLD  THEY BROKE THEIR WORD 
   SO WE EXACTED RETRIBUTION FROM THEM  WE DROWNED THEM IN THE SEA BECAUSE THEY REJECTED OUR SIGNS AND FAILED TO TAKE WARNING FROM THEM 
   AND WE MADE A PEOPLE CONSIDERED WEAK  AND OF NO ACCOUNT  INHERITORS OF LANDS IN BOTH EAST AND WEST LANDS WHEREON WE SENT DOWN OUR BLESSINGS  THE FAIR PROMISE OF THE LORD WAS FULFILLED FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BECAUSE THEY HAD PATIENCE AND CONSTANCY AND WE LEVELLED TO THE GROUND THE GREAT WORKS AND FINE BUILDINGS WHICH PHARAOH AND HIS PEOPLE ERECTED  WITH SUCH PRIDE  
   WE TOOK THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL  WITH SAFETY  ACROSS THE SEA  THEY CAME UPON A PEOPLE DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO SOME IDOLS THEY HAD  THEY SAID   O MOSES  FASHION FOR US A GOD LIKE UNTO THE GODS THEY HAVE   HE SAID   SURELY YE ARE A PEOPLE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE 
    AS TO THESE FOLK THE CULT THEY ARE IN IS  BUT  A FRAGMENT OF A RUIN AND VAIN IS THE  WORSHIP  WHICH THEY PRACTICE  
   HE SAID   SHALL I SEEK FOR YOU A GOD OTHER THAN THE  TRUE  GOD WHEN IT IS GOD WHO HATH ENDOWED YOU WITH GIFTS ABOVE THE NATIONS  
   AND REMEMBER WE RESCUED YOU FROM PHARAOH S PEOPLE WHO AFFLICTED YOU WITH THE WORST OF PENALTIES WHO SLEW YOUR MALE CHILDREN AND SAVED ALIVE YOUR FEMALES  IN THAT WAS A MOMENTOUS TRIAL FROM YOUR LORD SECTION  
   WE APPOINTED FOR MOSES THIRTY NIGHTS AND COMPLETED  THE PERIOD  WITH TEN  MORE   THUS WAS COMPLETED THE TERM  OF COMMUNION  WITH HIS LORD FORTY NIGHTS  AND MOSES HAD CHARGED HIS BROTHER AARON  BEFORE HE WENT UP    ACT FOR ME AMONGST MY PEOPLE  DO RIGHT AND FOLLOW NOT THE WAY OF THOSE WHO DO MISCHIEF  
   WHEN MOSES CAME TO THE PLACE APPOINTED BY US AND HIS LORD ADDRESSED HIM HE SAID   O MY LORD  SHOW  THYSELF  TO ME THAT I MAY LOOK UPON THEE   GOD SAID   BY NO MEANS CANST THOU SEE ME  DIRECT   BUT LOOK UPON THE MOUNT  IF IT ABIDE IN ITS PLACE THEN SHALT THOU SEE ME   WHEN HIS LORD MANIFESTED HIS GLORY ON THE MOUNT HE MADE IT AS DUST AND MOSES FELL DOWN IN A SWOON  WHEN HE RECOVERED HIS SENSES HE SAID   GLORY BE TO THEE  TO THEE I TURN IN REPENTANCE AND I AM THE FIRST TO BELIEVE    GOD  SAID   O MOSES  I HAVE CHOSEN THEE ABOVE  OTHER  MEN BY THE MISSION I  HAVE GIVEN THEE  AND THE WORDS I  HAVE SPOKEN TO THEE   TAKE THEN THE  REVELATION  WHICH I GIVE THEE AND BE OF THOSE WHO GIVE THANKS  
    GOD  SAID   O MOSES  I HAVE CHOSEN THEE ABOVE  OTHER  MEN BY THE MISSION I  HAVE GIVEN THEE  AND THE WORDS I  HAVE SPOKEN TO THEE   TAKE THEN THE  REVELATION  WHICH I GIVE THEE AND BE OF THOSE WHO GIVE THANKS  
   AND WE ORDAINED LAWS FOR HIM IN THE TABLETS IN ALL MATTERS BOTH COMMANDING AND EXPLAINING ALL THINGS  AND SAID    TAKE AND HOLD THESE WITH FIRMNESS AND ENJOIN THY PEOPLE TO HOLD FAST BY THE BEST IN THE PRECEPTS  SOON SHALL I SHOW YOU THE HOMES OF THE WICKED  HOW THEY LIE DESOLATE   
   THOSE WHO BEHAVE ARROGANTLY ON THE EARTH IN DEFIANCE OF RIGHT THEM WILL I TURN AWAY FROM MY SIGNS THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE IN THEM  AND IF THEY SEE THE WAY OF RIGHT CONDUCT THEY WILL NOT ADOPT IT AS THE WAY  BUT IF THEY SEE THE WAY OF ERROR THAT IS THE WAY THEY WILL ADOPT  FOR THEY REJECTED OUR SIGNS AND FAILED TO TAKE WARNING FROM THEM 
   THOSE WHO REJECT OUR SIGNS AND THE MEETING IN THE HEREAFTER VAIN ARE THEIR DEEDS  CAN THEY EXPECT TO BE REWARDED EXCEPT AS THEY HAVE WROUGHT SECTION  
   THE PEOPLE OF MOSES MADE IN HIS ABSENCE OUT OF THEIR ORNAMENTS THE IMAGE OF A CALF  FOR WORSHIP   IT SEEMED TO LOW  DID THEY NOT SEE THAT IT COULD NEITHER SPEAK TO THEM NOR SHOW THEM THE WAY  THEY TOOK IT FOR WORSHIP AND THEY DID WRONG 
   WHEN THEY REPENTED AND SAW THAT THEY HAD ERRED THEY SAID   IF OUR LORD HAVE NOT MERCY UPON US AND FORGIVE US WE SHALL INDEED BE OF THOSE WHO PERISH  
   WHEN MOSES CAME BACK TO HIS PEOPLE ANGRY AND GRIEVED HE SAID   EVIL IT IS THAT YE HAVE DONE IN MY PLACE IN MY ABSENCE  DID YE MAKE HASTE TO BRING ON THE JUDGMENT OF YOUR LORD   HE PUT DOWN THE TABLETS SEIZED HIS BROTHER BY  THE HAIR OF  HIS HEAD AND DRAGGED HIM TO HIM  AARON SAID   SON OF MY MOTHER  THE PEOPLE DID INDEED RECKON ME AS NAUGHT AND WENT NEAR TO SLAYING ME  MAKE NOT THE ENEMIES REJOICE OVER MY MISFORTUNE NOR COUNT THOU ME AMONGST THE PEOPLE OF SIN  
   MOSES PRAYED   O MY LORD  FORGIVE ME AND MY BROTHER  ADMIT US TO THY MERCY  FOR THOU ART THE MOST MERCIFUL OF THOSE WHO SOW MERCY  SECTION  
   THOSE WHO TOOK THE CALF  FOR WORSHIP  WILL INDEED BE OVERWHELMED WITH WRATH FROM THEIR LORD AND WITH SHAME IN THIS LIFE  THUS DO WE RECOMPENSE THOSE WHO INVENT  FALSEHOODS  
   BUT THOSE WHO DO WRONG BUT REPENT THEREAFTER AND  TRULY  BELIEVE VERILY THY LORD IS THEREAFTER OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   WHEN THE ANGER OF MOSES WAS APPEASED HE TOOK UP THE TABLETS  IN THE WRITING THEREON WAS GUIDANCE AND MERCY FOR SUCH AS FEAR THEIR LORD 
   AND MOSES CHOSE SEVENTY OF HIS PEOPLE FOR OUR PLACE OF MEETING  WHEN THEY WERE SEIZED WITH VIOLENT QUAKING HE PRAYED   O MY LORD  IF IT HAD BEEN THY WILL THOU COULDST HAVE DESTROYED LONG BEFORE BOTH THEM AND ME  WOULDST THOU DESTROY US FOR THE DEEDS OF THE FOOLISH ONE AMONG US  THIS IS NO MORE THAN THY TRIAL  BY IT THOU CAUSEST WHOM THOU WILT TO STRAY AND THOU LEADEST WHOM THOU WILT INTO THE RIGHT PATH  THOU ART OUR PROTECTOR  SO FORGIVE US AND GIVE US THY MERCY  FOR THOU ART THE BEST OF THOSE WHO FORGIVE 
    AND ORDAIN FOR US THAT WHICH IS GOOD IN THIS LIFE AND IN THE HEREAFTER  FOR WE HAVE TURNED UNTO THEE   HE SAID   WITH MY PUNISHMENT I VISIT WHOM I WILL  BUT MY MERCY EXTENDETH TO ALL THINGS  THAT  MERCY  I SHALL ORDAIN FOR THOSE WHO DO RIGHT AND PRACTICE REGULAR CHARITY AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN OUR SIGNS 
    THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE APOSTLE THE UNLETTERED PROPHET WHOM THEY FIND MENTIONED IN THEIR OWN  SCRIPTURES   IN THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL  FOR HE COMMANDS THEM WHAT IS JUST AND FORBIDS THEM WHAT IS EVIL  HE ALLOWS THEM AS LAWFUL WHAT IS GOOD  AND PURE  AND PROHIBITS THEM FROM WHAT IS BAD  AND IMPURE   HE RELEASES THEM FROM THEIR HEAVY BURDENS AND FROM THE YOKES THAT ARE UPON THEM  SO IT IS THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN HIM HONOR HIM HELP HIM AND FOLLOW THE LIGHT WHICH IS SENT DOWN WITH HIM IT IS THEY WHO WILL PROSPER  SECTION  
   SAY   O MEN  I AM SENT UNTO YOU ALL AS THE APOSTLE OF GOD TO WHOM BELONGETH THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE  IT IS HE THAT GIVETH BOTH LIFE AND DEATH  SO BELIEVE IN GOD AND HIS APOSTLE THE UNLETTERED PROPHET WHO BELIEVED IN GOD AND HIS WORDS  FOLLOW HIM THAT  SO  YE MAY BE GUIDED  
   OF THE PEOPLE OF MOSES THERE IS A SECTION WHO GUIDE AND DO JUSTICE IN THE LIGHT OF TRUTH 
   WE DIVIDED THEM INTO TWELVE TRIBES OR NATIONS  WE DIRECTED MOSES BY INSPIRATION WHEN HIS  THIRSTY  PEOPLE ASKED HIM FOR WATER   STRIKE THE ROCK WITH THY STAFF   OUT OF IT THERE GUSHED FORTH TWELVE SPRINGS  EACH GROUP KNEW ITS OWN PLACE FOR WATER  WE GAVE THEM THE SHADE OF CLOUDS AND SENT DOWN TO THEM MANNA AND QUAILS  SAYING    EAT OF THE GOOD THINGS WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR YOU    BUT THEY REBELLED   TO US THEY DID NO HARM BUT THEY HARMED THEIR OWN SOULS 
   AND REMEMBER IT WAS SAID TO THEM   DWELL IN THIS TOWN AND EAT THEREIN AS YE WISH BUT SAY THE WORD OF HUMILITY AND ENTER THE GATE IN A POSTURE OF HUMILITY  WE SHALL FORGIVE YOU YOUR FAULTS  WE SHALL INCREASE  THE PORTION OF  THOSE WHO DO GOOD  
   BUT THE TRANSGRESSORS AMONG THEM CHANGED THE WORD FROM THAT WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN THEM  SO WE SENT ON THEM A PLAGUE FROM HEAVEN FOR THAT THEY REPEATEDLY TRANSGRESSED SECTION  
   ASK THEM CONCERNING THE TOWN STANDING CLOSE BY THE SEA  BEHOLD  THEY TRANSGRESSED IN THE MATTER OF THE SABBATH  FOR ON THE DAY OF THEIR SABBATH THEIR FISH DID COME TO THEM OPENLY HOLDING UP THEIR HEADS BUT ON THE DAY THEY HAD NO SABBATH THEY CAME NOT  THUS DID WE MAKE A TRIAL OF THEM FOR THEY WERE GIVEN TO TRANSGRESSION 
   WHEN SOME OF THEM SAID   WHY DO YE PREACH TO A PEOPLE WHOM GOD WILL DESTROY OR VISIT WITH A TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT   SAID THE PREACHERS   TO DISCHARGE OUR DUTY TO YOUR LORD AND PERCHANCE THEY MAY FEAR HIM  
   WHEN THEY DISREGARDED THE WARNINGS THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN THEM WE RESCUED THOSE WHO FORBADE EVIL  BUT WE VISITED THE WRONG DOERS WITH A GRIEVOUS PUNISHMENT BECAUSE THEY WERE GIVEN TO TRANSGRESSION 
   WHEN IN THEIR INSOLENCE THEY TRANSGRESSED  ALL  PROHIBITION WE SAID TO THEM   BE YE APES DESPISED AND REJECTED  
   BEHOLD  THY LORD DID DECLARE THAT HE WOULD SEND AGAINST THEM TO THE DAY OF JUDGMENT THOSE WHO WOULD AFFLICT THEM WITH GRIEVOUS PENALTY  THY LORD IS QUICK IN RETRIBUTION BUT HE IS ALSO OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   WE BROKE THEM UP INTO SECTIONS ON THIS EARTH  THERE ARE AMONG THEM SOME THAT ARE THE RIGHTEOUS AND SOME THAT ARE THE OPPOSITE  WE HAVE TRIED THEM WITH BOTH PROSPERITY AND ADVERSITY  IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT TURN  TO US  
   AFTER THEM SUCCEEDED AN  EVIL  GENERATION  THEY INHERITED THE BOOK BUT THEY CHOSE  FOR THEMSELVES  THE VANITIES OF THIS WORLD SAYING  FOR EXCUSE     EVERYTHING  WILL BE FORGIVEN US    EVEN SO  IF SIMILAR VANITIES CAME THEIR WAY THEY WOULD  AGAIN  SEIZE THEM  WAS NOT THE COVENANT OF THE BOOK TAKEN FROM THEM THAT THEY WOULD NOT ASCRIBE TO GOD ANYTHING BUT THE TRUTH  AND THEY STUDY WHAT IS IN THE BOOK  BUT BEST FOR THE RIGHTEOUS IS THE HOME IN THE HEREAFTER  WILL YE NOT UNDERSTAND 
   AS TO THOSE WHO HOLD FAST BY THE BOOK AND ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER  NEVER SHALL WE SUFFER THE REWARD OF THE RIGHTEOUS TO PERISH 
   WHEN WE SHOOK THE MOUNT OVER THEM AS IF IT HAD BEEN A CANOPY AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO FALL ON THEM  WE SAID    HOLD FIRMLY TO WHAT WE HAVE GIVEN YOU AND BRING  EVEN  TO REMEMBRANCE WHAT IS THEREIN  PERCHANCE YE MAY FEAR GOD  SECTION  
   WHEN THY LORD DREW FORTH FROM THE CHILDREN OF ADAM FROM THEIR LOINS THEIR DESCENDANTS AND MADE THEM TESTIFY CONCERNING THEMSELVES  SAYING    AM I NOT YOUR LORD  WHO CHERISHES AND SUSTAINS YOU    THEY SAID   YEA  WE DO TESTIFY    THIS  LEST YE SHOULD SAY ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT   OF THIS WE WERE NEVER MINDFUL  
   OR LEST YE SHOULD SAY   OUR FATHERS BEFORE US MAY HAVE TAKEN FALSE GODS BUT WE ARE  THEIR  DESCENDANTS AFTER THEM  WILT THOU THEN DESTROY US BECAUSE OF THE DEEDS OF MEN WHO WERE FUTILE  
   THUS DO WE EXPLAIN THE SIGNS IN DETAIL  AND PERCHANCE THEY MAY TURN  UNTO US  
   RELATE TO THEM THE STORY OF THE MAN TO WHOM WE SENT OUR SIGNS BUT HE PASSED THEM BY  SO SATAN FOLLOWED HIM UP AND HE WENT ASTRAY 
   IF IT HAD BEEN OUR WILL WE SHOULD HAVE ELEVATED HIM WITH OUR SIGNS  BUT HE INCLINED TO THE EARTH AND FOLLOWED HIS OWN VAIN DESIRES  HIS SIMILITUDE IS THAT OF A DOG  IF YOU ATTACK HIM HE LOLLS OUT HIS TONGUE OR IF YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE HE  STILL  LOLLS OUT HIS TONGUE  THAT IS THE SIMILITUDE OF THOSE WHO REJECT OUR SIGNS  SO RELATE THE STORY  PERCHANCE THEY MAY REFLECT 
   EVIL AS AN EXAMPLE ARE PEOPLE WHO REJECT OUR SIGNS AND WRONG THEIR OWN SOULS 
   WHOM GOD DOTH GUIDE HE IS ON THE RIGHT PATH  WHOM HE REJECTS FROM HIS GUIDANCE SUCH ARE THE PERSONS WHO PERISH 
   MANY ARE THE JINNS AND MEN WE HAVE MADE FOR HELL  THEY HAVE HEARTS WHEREWITH THEY UNDERSTAND NOT EYES WHEREWITH THEY SEE NOT AND EARS WHEREWITH THEY HEAR NOT  THEY ARE LIKE CATTLE NAY MORE MISGUIDED  FOR THEY ARE HEEDLESS  OF WARNING  
   THE MOST BEAUTIFUL NAMES BELONG TO GOD  SO CALL ON HIM BY THEM  BUT SHUN SUCH MEN AS USE PROFANITY IN HIS NAMES  FOR WHAT THEY DO THEY WILL SOON BE REQUITED 
   OF THOSE WE HAVE CREATED ARE PEOPLE WHO DIRECT  OTHERS  WITH TRUTH AND DISPENSE JUSTICE THEREWITH SECTION  
   THOSE WHO REJECT OUR SIGNS WE SHALL GRADUALLY VISIT WITH PUNISHMENT IN WAYS THEY PERCEIVE NOT 
   RESPITE WILL I GRANT UNTO THEM  FOR MY SCHEME IS STRONG  AND UNFAILING  
   DO THEY NOT REFLECT  THEIR COMPANION IS NOT SEIZED WITH MADNESS  HE IS BUT A PERSPICUOUS WARNER 
   DO THEY SEE NOTHING IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL THAT GOD HATH CREATED   DO THEY NOT SEE  THAT IT MAY WELL BE THAT THEIR TERM IS NIGH DRAWING TO AN END  IN WHAT MESSAGE AFTER THIS WILL THEY THEN BELIEVE 
   TO SUCH AS GOD REJECTS FROM HIS GUIDANCE THERE CAN BE NO GUIDE  HE WILL LEAVE THEM IN THEIR TRESPASSES WANDERING IN DISTRACTION 
   THEY ASK THEE ABOUT THE  FINAL  HOUR WHEN WILL BE ITS APPOINTED TIME  SAY   THE KNOWLEDGE THEREOF IS WITH MY LORD  ALONE   NONE BUT HE CAN REVEAL AS TO WHEN IT WILL OCCUR  HEAVY WERE ITS BURDEN THROUGH THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  ONLY ALL OF A SUDDEN WILL IT COME TO YOU  THEY ASK THEE AS IF THOU WERT EAGER IN SEARCH THEREOF  SAY   THE KNOWLEDGE THEREOF IS WITH GOD  ALONE  BUT MOST MEN KNOW NOT  
   SAY   I HAVE NO POWER OVER ANY GOOD OR HARM TO MYSELF EXCEPT AS GOD WILLETH  IF I HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNSEEN I SHOULD HAVE MULTIPLIED ALL GOOD AND NO EVIL SHOULD HAVE TOUCHED ME I AM BUT A WARNER AND A BRINGER OF GLAD TIDINGS TO THOSE WHO HAVE FAITH  SECTION  
   IT IS HE WHO CREATED YOU FROM A SINGLE PERSON AND MADE HIS MATE OF LIKE NATURE IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT DWELL WITH HER  IN LOVE   WHEN THEY ARE UNITED SHE BEARS A LIGHT BURDEN AND CARRIES IT ABOUT  UNNOTICED   WHEN SHE GROWS HEAVY THEY BOTH PRAY TO GOD THEIR LORD  SAYING    IF THOU GIVEST US A GOODLY CHILD WE VOW WE SHALL  EVER  BE GRATEFUL  
   BUT WHEN HE GIVETH THEM A GOODLY CHILD THEY ASCRIBE TO OTHERS A SHARE IN THE GIFT THEY HAVE RECEIVED  BUT GOD IS EXALTED HIGH ABOVE THE PARTNERS THEY ASCRIBE TO HIM 
   DO THEY INDEED ASCRIBE TO HIM AS PARTNERS THINGS THAT CAN CREATE NOTHING BUT ARE THEMSELVES CREATED 
   NO AID CAN THEY GIVE THEM NOR CAN THEY AID THEMSELVES 
   IF YE CALL THEM TO GUIDANCE THEY WILL NOT OBEY  FOR YOU IT IS THE SAME WHETHER YE CALL THEM OR YE HOLD YOUR PEACE 
   VERILY THOSE WHOM YE CALL UPON BESIDES GOD ARE SERVANTS LIKE UNTO YOU  CALL UPON THEM AND LET THEM LISTEN TO YOUR PRAYER IF YE ARE  INDEED  TRUTHFUL 
   HAVE THEY FEET TO WALK WITH  OR HANDS TO LAY HOLD WITH  OR EYES TO SEE WITH  OR EARS TO HEAR WITH  SAY   CALL YOUR GOD PARTNERS SCHEME  YOUR WORST  AGAINST ME AND GIVE ME NO RESPITE 
    FOR MY PROTECTOR IS GOD WHO REVEALED THE BOOK  FROM TIME TO TIME  AND HE WILL CHOOSE AND BEFRIEND THE RIGHTEOUS 
    BUT THOSE YE CALL UPON BESIDES HIM ARE UNABLE TO HELP YOU AND INDEED TO HELP THEMSELVES  
   IF THOU CALLEST THEM TO GUIDANCE THEY HEAR NOT  THOU WILT SEE THEM LOOKING AT THEE BUT THEY SEE NOT 
   HOLD TO FORGIVENESS  COMMAND WHAT IS RIGHT  BUT TURN AWAY FROM THE IGNORANT 
   IF A SUGGESTION FROM SATAN ASSAIL THY  MIND  SEEK REFUGE WITH GOD  FOR HE HEARETH AND KNOWETH  ALL THINGS  
   THOSE WHO FEAR GOD WHEN A THOUGHT OF EVIL FROM SATAN ASSAULTS THEM BRING GOD TO REMEMBRANCE WHEN LO  THEY SEE  ARIGHT  
   BUT THEIR BRETHREN  THE EVIL ONES  PLUNGE THEM DEEPER INTO ERROR AND NEVER RELAX  THEIR EFFORTS  
   IF THOU BRING THEM NOT A REVELATION THEY SAY   WHY HAST THOU NOT GOT IT TOGETHER   SAY   I BUT FOLLOW WHAT IS REVEALED TO ME FROM MY LORD  THIS IS  NOTHING BUT  LIGHTS FROM YOUR LORD AND GUIDANCE AND MERCY FOR ANY WHO HAVE FAITH 
   WHEN THE QUR AN IS READ LISTEN TO IT WITH ATTENTION AND HOLD YOUR PEACE  THAT YE MAY RECEIVE MERCY 
   AND DO THOU  O READER   BRING THY LORD TO REMEMBRANCE IN THY  VERY  SOUL WITH HUMILITY AND IN REVERENCE WITHOUT LOUDNESS IN WORDS IN THE MORNINGS AND EVENINGS  AND BE NOT THOU OF THOSE WHO ARE UNHEEDFUL 
   THOSE WHO ARE NEAR TO THY LORD DISDAIN NOT TO DO HIM WORSHIP  THEY CELEBRATE HIS PRAISES AND BOW DOWN BEFORE HIM 
   THEY ASK THEE CONCERNING  THINGS TAKEN AS  SPOILS OF WAR  SAY    SUCH  SPOILS ARE AT THE DISPOSAL OF GOD AND THE APOSTLE  SO FEAR GOD AND KEEP STRAIGHT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN YOURSELVES  OBEY GOD AND HIS APOSTLE IF YE DO BELIEVE  
   FOR BELIEVERS ARE THOSE WHO WHEN GOD IS MENTIONED FEEL A TREMOR IN THEIR HEARTS AND WHEN THEY HEAR HIS SIGNS REHEARSED FIND THEIR FAITH STRENGTHENED AND PUT  ALL  THEIR TRUST IN THEIR LORD 
   WHO ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS AND SPEND  FREELY  OUT OF THE GIFTS WE HAVE GIVEN THEM FOR SUSTENANCE 
   SUCH IN TRUTH ARE THE BELIEVERS  THEY HAVE GRADES OF DIGNITY WITH THEIR LORD AND FORGIVENESS AND GENEROUS SUSTENANCE 
   JUST AS THY LORD ORDERED THEE OUT OF THY HOUSE IN TRUTH EVEN THOUGH A PARTY AMONG THE BELIEVERS DISLIKED IT 
   DISPUTING WITH THEE CONCERNING THE TRUTH AFTER IT WAS MADE MANIFEST AS IF THEY WERE BEING DRIVEN TO DEATH AND THEY  ACTUALLY  SAW IT 
   BEHOLD  GOD PROMISED YOU ONE OF THE TWO  ENEMY  PARTIES THAT IT SHOULD BE YOURS  YE WISHED THAT THE ONE UNARMED SHOULD BE YOURS BUT GOD WILLED TO JUSTIFY THE TRUTH ACCORDING TO HIS WORDS AND TO CUT OFF THE ROOTS OF THE UNBELIEVERS 
   THAT HE MIGHT JUSTIFY AND PROVE FALSEHOOD FALSE DISTASTEFUL THOUGH IT BE TO THOSE IN GUILT 
   REMEMBER YE IMPLORED THE ASSISTANCE OF YOUR LORD AND HE ANSWERED YOU   I WILL ASSIST YOU WITH A THOUSAND OF THE ANGELS RANKS ON RANKS  
   GOD MADE IT BUT A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND AN ASSURANCE TO YOUR HEART   IN ANY CASE  THERE IS NO HELP EXCEPT FROM GOD  AND GOD IS EXALTED IN POWER WISE SECTION  
   REMEMBER HE COVERED YOU WITH A SORT OF DROWSINESS TO GIVE YOU CALM AS FROM HIMSELF AND HE CAUSED RAIN TO DESCEND ON YOU FROM HEAVEN TO CLEAN YOU THEREWITH TO REMOVE FROM YOU THE STAIN OF SATAN TO STRENGTHEN YOUR HEARTS AND TO PLANT YOUR FEET FIRMLY THEREWITH 
   REMEMBER THY LORD INSPIRED THE ANGELS  WITH THE MESSAGE    I AM WITH YOU  GIVE FIRMNESS TO THE BELIEVERS  I WILL INSTIL TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF THE UNBELIEVERS  SMITE YE ABOVE THEIR NECKS AND SMITE ALL THEIR FINGER TIPS OFF THEM  
   THIS BECAUSE THEY CONTENDED AGAINST GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  IF ANY CONTEND AGAINST GOD AND HIS APOSTLE GOD IS STRICT IN PUNISHMENT 
   THUS  WILL IT BE SAID    TASTE YE THEN OF THE  PUNISHMENT   FOR THOSE WHO RESIST GOD IS THE PENALTY OF THE FIRE  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  WHEN YE MEET THE UNBELIEVERS IN HOSTILE ARRAY NEVER TURN YOUR BACKS TO THEM 
   IF ANY DO TURN HIS BACK TO THEM ON SUCH A DAY UNLESS IT BE IN A STRATAGEM OF WAR OR TO RETREAT TO A TROOP  OF HIS OWN  HE DRAWS ON HIMSELF THE WRATH OF GOD AND HIS ABODE IS HELL AND EVIL REFUGE  INDEED  
   IT IS NOT YE WHO SLEW THEM  IT WAS GOD  WHEN THOU THREWEST  A HANDFUL OF DUST  IT WAS NOT THY ACT BUT GOD S  IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT TEST THE BELIEVERS BY A GRACIOUS TRIAL FROM HIMSELF  FOR GOD IS HE WHO HEARETH AND KNOWETH  ALL THINGS  
   THAT AND ALSO BECAUSE GOD IS HE WHO MAKES FEEBLE THE PLANS AND STRATAGEMS OF THE UNBELIEVERS 
    O UNBELIEVERS   IF YE PRAYED FOR VICTORY AND JUDGMENT NOW HATH THE JUDGMENT COME TO YOU  IF YE DESIST  FROM WRONG  IT WILL BE BEST FOR YOU  IF YE RETURN  TO THE ATTACK  SO SHALL WE  NOT THE LEAST GOOD WILL YOUR FORCES BE TO YOU EVEN IF THEY WERE MULTIPLIED  FOR VERILY GOD IS WITH THOSE WHO BELIEVE SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  OBEY GOD AND HIS APOSTLE AND TURN NOT AWAY FROM HIM WHEN YE HEAR  HIM SPEAK  
   NOR BE LIKE THOSE WHO SAY  WE HEAR  BUT LISTEN NOT 
   FOR THE WORST OF BEASTS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD ARE THE DEAF AND THE DUMB THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND NOT 
   IF GOD HAD FOUND IN THEM ANY GOOD HE WOULD INDEED HAVE MADE THEM LISTEN   AS IT IS  IF HE HAD MADE THEM LISTEN THEY WOULD BUT HAVE TURNED BACK AND DECLINED  FAITH  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  GIVE YOUR RESPONSE TO GOD AND HIS APOSTLE WHEN HE CALLETH YOU TO THAT WHICH WILL GIVE YOU LIFE  AND KNOW THAT GOD COMETH IN BETWEEN A MAN AND HIS HEART AND THAT IT IS HE TO WHOM YE SHALL  ALL  BE GATHERED 
   AND FEAR TUMULT OR OPPRESSION WHICH AFFECTETH NOT IN PARTICULAR  ONLY  THOSE OF YOU WHO DO WRONG AND KNOW THAT GOD IS STRICT IN PUNISHMENT 
   CALL TO MIND WHEN YE WERE A SMALL  BAND  DESPISED THROUGH THE LAND AND AFRAID THAT MEN MIGHT DESPOIL AND KIDNAP YOU  BUT HE PROVIDED A SAFE ASYLUM FOR YOU STRENGTHENED YOU WITH HIS AID AND GAVE YOU GOOD THINGS FOR SUSTENANCE  THAT YE MIGHT BE GRATEFUL 
   O YE THAT BELIEVE  BETRAY NOT THE TRUST OF GOD AND THE APOSTLE NOR MISAPPROPRIATE KNOWINGLY THINGS ENTRUSTED TO YOU 
   AND KNOW YE THAT YOUR POSSESSIONS AND YOUR PROGENY ARE BUT A TRIAL  AND THAT IT IS GOD WITH WHOM LIES YOUR HIGHEST REWARD SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  IF YE FEAR GOD HE WILL GRANT YOU A CRITERION  TO JUDGE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG  REMOVE FROM YOU  ALL  EVIL  THAT MAY AFFLICT  YOU AND FORGIVE YOU  FOR GOD IS THE LORD OF GRACE UNBOUNDED 
   REMEMBER HOW THE UNBELIEVERS PLOTTED AGAINST THEE TO KEEP THEE IN BONDS OR SLAY THEE OR GET THEE OUT  OF THY HOME   THEY PLOT AND PLAN AND GOD TOO PLANS BUT THE BEST OF PLANNERS IS GOD 
   WHEN OUR SIGNS ARE REHEARSED TO THEM THEY SAY   WE HAVE HEARD THIS  BEFORE   IF WE WISHED WE COULD SAY  WORDS  LIKE THESE  THESE ARE NOTHING BUT TALES OF THE ANCIENTS  
   REMEMBER HOW THEY SAID   O GOD  IF THIS IS INDEED THE TRUTH FROM THEE RAIN DOWN ON US A SHOWER OF STONES FROM THE SKY OR SEND US A GRIEVOUS PENALTY  
   BUT GOD WAS NOT GOING TO SEND THEM A PENALTY WHILST THOU WAST AMONGST THEM  NOR WAS HE GOING TO SEND IT WHILST THEY COULD ASK FOR PARDON 
   BUT WHAT PLEA HAVE THEY THAT GOD SHOULD NOT PUNISH THEM WHEN THEY KEEP OUT  MEN  FROM THE SACRED MOSQUE AND THEY ARE NOT ITS GUARDIANS  NO MEN CAN BE ITS GUARDIANS EXCEPT THE RIGHTEOUS  BUT MOST OF THEM DO NOT UNDERSTAND 
   THEIR PRAYER AT THE HOUSE  OF GOD  IS NOTHING BUT WHISTLING AND CLAPPING OF HANDS   ITS ONLY ANSWER CAN BE   TASTE YE THE PENALTY BECAUSE YE BLASPHEMED  
   THE UNBELIEVERS SPEND THEIR WEALTH TO HINDER  MEN  FROM THE PATH OF GOD AND SO WILL THEY CONTINUE TO SPEND  BUT IN THE END THEY WILL HAVE  ONLY  REGRETS AND SIGHS  AT LENGTH THEY WILL BE OVERCOME  AND THE UNBELIEVERS WILL BE GATHERED TOGETHER TO HELL 
   IN ORDER THAT GOD MAY SEPARATE THE IMPURE FROM THE PURE PUT THE IMPURE ONE ON ANOTHER HEAP THEM TOGETHER AND CAST THEM INTO HELL  THEY WILL BE THE ONES TO HAVE LOST SECTION  
   SAY TO THE UNBELIEVERS IF  NOW  THEY DESIST  FROM UNBELIEF  THEIR PAST WOULD BE FORGIVEN THEM  BUT IF THEY PERSIST THE PUNISHMENT OF THOSE BEFORE THEM IS ALREADY  A MATTER OF WARNING FOR THEM  
   AND FIGHT THEM ON UNTIL THERE IS NO MORE TUMULT OR OPPRESSION AND THERE PREVAIL JUSTICE AND FAITH IN GOD ALTOGETHER AND EVERYWHERE  BUT IF THEY CEASE VERILY GOD DOTH SEE ALL THAT THEY DO 
   IF THEY REFUSE BE SURE THAT GOD IS YOUR PROTECTOR THE BEST TO PROTECT AND THE BEST TO HELP 
   AND KNOW THAT OUT OF ALL THE BOOTY THAT YE MAY ACQUIRE  IN WAR  A FIFTH SHARE IS ASSIGNED TO GOD AND TO THE APOSTLE AND TO NEAR RELATIVES ORPHANS THE NEEDY AND THE WAYFARER IF YE DO BELIEVE IN GOD AND IN THE REVELATION WE SENT DOWN TO OUR SERVANT ON THE DAY OF TESTING THE DAY OF THE MEETING OF THE TWO FORCES  FOR GOD HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   REMEMBER YE WERE ON THE HITHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY AND THEY ON THE FARTHER SIDE AND THE CARAVAN ON LOWER GROUND THAN YE  EVEN IF YE HAD MADE A MUTUAL APPOINTMENT TO MEET YE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FAILED IN THE APPOINTMENT  BUT  THUS YE MET  THAT GOD MIGHT ACCOMPLISH A MATTER ALREADY ENACTED  THAT THOSE WHO DIED MIGHT DIE AFTER A CLEAR SIGN  HAD BEEN GIVEN  AND THOSE WHO LIVED MIGHT LIVE AFTER A CLEAR SIGN  HAD BEEN GIVEN   AND VERILY GOD IS HE WHO HEARETH AND KNOWETH  ALL THINGS  
   REMEMBER IN THY DREAM GOD SHOWED THEM TO THEE AS FEW  IF HE HAD SHOWN THEM TO THEE AS MANY YE WOULD SURELY HAVE BEEN DISCOURAGED AND YE WOULD SURELY HAVE DISPUTED IN  YOUR  DECISION  BUT GOD SAVED  YOU   FOR HE KNOWETH WELL THE  SECRETS  OF  ALL  HEARTS 
   AND REMEMBER WHEN YE MET HE SHOWED THEM TO YOU AS FEW IN YOUR EYES AND HE MADE YOU APPEAR AS CONTEMPTIBLE IN THEIR EYES  THAT GOD MIGHT ACCOMPLISH A MATTER ALREADY ENACTED  FOR TO GOD DO ALL QUESTIONS GO BACK  FOR DECISION  SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  WHEN YE MEET A FORCE BE FIRM AND CALL GOD IN REMEMBRANCE MUCH  AND OFTEN   THAT YE MAY PROSPER 
   AND OBEY GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  AND FALL INTO NO DISPUTES LEST YE LOSE HEART AND YOUR POWER DEPART  AND BE PATIENT AND PERSEVERING  FOR GOD IS WITH THOSE WHO PATIENTLY PERSEVERE 
   AND BE NOT LIKE THOSE WHO STARTED FROM THEIR HOMES INSOLENTLY AND TO BE SEEN OF MEN AND TO HINDER  MEN  FROM THE PATH OF GOD  FOR GOD COMPASSETH ROUND ABOUT ALL THAT THEY DO 
   REMEMBER SATAN MADE THEIR  SINFUL  ACTS SEEM ALLURING TO THEM AND SAID   NO ONE AMONG MEN CAN OVERCOME YOU THIS DAY WHILE I AM NEAR TO YOU   BUT WHEN THE TWO FORCES CAME IN SIGHT OF EACH OTHER HE TURNED ON HIS HEELS AND SAID   LO  I AM CLEAR OF YOU  LO  I SEE WHAT YE SEE NOT  LO  I FEAR GOD  FOR GOD IS STRICT IN PUNISHMENT SECTION  
   LO  THE HYPOCRITES SAY AND THOSE IN WHOSE HEARTS IS A DISEASE   THESE PEOPLE THEIR RELIGION HAS MISLED THEM   BUT IF ANY TRUST IN GOD BEHOLD  GOD IS EXALTED IN MIGHT WISE 
   IF THOU COULDST SEE WHEN THE ANGELS TAKE THE SOULS OF THE UNBELIEVERS  AT DEATH   HOW  THEY SMITE THEIR FACES AND THEIR BACKS  SAYING    TASTE THE PENALTY OF THE BLAZING FIRE 
    BECAUSE OF  THE DEEDS  WHICH YOUR  OWN  HANDS SENT FORTH  FOR GOD IS NEVER UNJUST TO HIS SERVANTS 
     DEEDS  AFTER THE MANNER OF THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH AND OF THOSE BEFORE THEM  THEY REJECTED THE SIGNS OF GOD AND GOD PUNISHED THEM FOR THEIR CRIMES  FOR GOD IS STRONG AND STRICT IN PUNISHMENT 
    BECAUSE GOD WILL NEVER CHANGE THE GRACE WHICH HE HATH BESTOWED ON A PEOPLE UNTIL THEY CHANGE WHAT IS IN THEIR  OWN  SOULS  AND VERILY GOD IS HE WHO HEARETH AND KNOWETH  ALL THINGS   
     DEEDS  AFTER THE MANNER OF THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH AND THOSE BEFORE THEM   THEY TREATED AS FALSE THE SIGNS OF THEIR LORD  SO WE DESTROYED THEM FOR THEIR CRIMES AND WE DROWNED THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH  FOR THEY WERE ALL OPPRESSORS AND WRONG DOERS 
   FOR THE WORST OF BEASTS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD ARE THOSE WHO REJECT HIM  THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE 
   THEY ARE THOSE WITH WHOM THOU DIDST MAKE A COVENANT BUT THEY BREAK THEIR COVENANT EVERY TIME AND THEY HAVE NOT THE FEAR  OF GOD  
   IF YE GAIN THE MASTERY OVER THEM IN WAR DISPERSE WITH THEM THOSE WHO FOLLOW THEM THAT THEY MAY REMEMBER 
   IF THOU FEAREST TREACHERY FROM ANY GROUP THROW BACK  THEIR COVENANT  TO THEM  SO AS TO BE  ON EQUAL TERMS  FOR GOD LOVETH NOT THE TREACHEROUS SECTION  
   LET NOT THE UNBELIEVERS THINK THAT THEY CAN GET THE BETTER  OF GOD   THEY WILL NEVER FRUSTRATE  THEM  
   AGAINST THEM MAKE READY YOUR STRENGTH TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR POWER INCLUDING STEEDS OF WAR TO STRIKE TERROR INTO  THE HEARTS OF  THE ENEMIES OF GOD AND YOUR ENEMIES AND OTHERS BESIDES WHOM YE MAY NOT KNOW BUT WHOM GOD DOTH KNOW  WHATEVER YE SHALL SPEND IN THE CAUSE OF GOD SHALL BE REPAID UNTO YOU AND YE SHALL NOT BE TREATED UNJUSTLY 
   BUT IF THE ENEMY INCLINE TOWARDS PEACE DO THOU  ALSO  INCLINE TOWARDS PEACE AND TRUST IN GOD  FOR HE IS THE ONE THAT HEARETH AND KNOWETH  ALL THINGS  
   SHOULD THEY INTEND TO DECEIVE THEE VERILY GOD SUFFICETH THEE  HE IT IS THAT HATH STRENGTHENED THEE WITH HIS AID AND WITH  THE COMPANY OF  THE BELIEVERS 
   AND  MOREOVER  HE HATH PUT AFFECTION BETWEEN THEIR HEARTS  NOT IF THOU HADST SPENT ALL THAT IS IN THE EARTH COULDST THOU HAVE PRODUCED THAT AFFECTION BUT GOD HATH DONE IT  FOR HE IS EXALTED IN MIGHT WISE 
   O APOSTLE  SUFFICIENT UNTO THEE IS GOD  UNTO THEE  AND UNTO THOSE WHO FOLLOW THEE AMONG THE BELIEVERS SECTION  
   O APOSTLE  ROUSE THE BELIEVERS TO THE FIGHT  IF THERE ARE TWENTY AMONGST YOU PATIENT AND PERSEVERING THEY WILL VANQUISH TWO HUNDRED  IF A HUNDRED THEY WILL VANQUISH A THOUSAND OF THE UNBELIEVERS  FOR THESE ARE A PEOPLE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING 
   FOR THE PRESENT GOD HATH LIGHTENED YOUR  TASK  FOR HE KNOWETH THAT THERE IS A WEAK SPOT IN YOU  BUT  EVEN SO  IF THERE ARE A HUNDRED OF YOU PATIENT AND PERSEVERING THEY WILL VANQUISH TWO HUNDRED AND IF A THOUSAND THEY WILL VANQUISH TWO THOUSAND WITH THE LEAVE OF GOD  FOR GOD IS WITH THOSE WHO PATIENTLY PERSEVERE 
   IT IS NOT FITTING FOR AN APOSTLE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE PRISONERS OF WAR UNTIL HE HATH THOROUGHLY SUBDUED THE LAND  YE LOOK FOR THE TEMPORAL GOODS OF THIS WORLD  BUT GOD LOOKETH TO THE HEREAFTER  AND GOD IS EXALTED IN MIGHT WISE 
   HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR A PREVIOUS ORDAINMENT FROM GOD A SEVERE PENALTY WOULD HAVE REACHED YOU FOR THE  RANSOM  THAT YE TOOK 
   BUT  NOW  ENJOY WHAT YE TOOK IN WAR LAWFUL AND GOOD  BUT FEAR GOD  FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL SECTION  
   O APOSTLE  SAY TO THOSE WHO ARE CAPTIVES IN YOUR HANDS   IF GOD FINDETH ANY GOOD IN YOUR HEARTS HE WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING BETTER THAN WHAT HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM YOU AND HE WILL FORGIVE YOU  FOR GOD IS OFT  FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL  
   BUT IF THEY HAVE TREACHEROUS DESIGNS AGAINST THEE  O APOSTLE   THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN TREASON AGAINST GOD AND SO HATH HE GIVEN  THEE  POWER OVER THEM AND GOD IS HE WHO HATH  FULL  KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM 
   THOSE WHO BELIEVED AND ADOPTED EXILE AND FOUGHT FOR THE FAITH WITH THEIR PROPERTY AND THEIR PERSONS IN THE CAUSE OF GOD AS WELL AS THOSE WHO GAVE  THEM  ASYLUM AND AID THESE ARE  ALL  FRIENDS AND PROTECTORS ONE OF ANOTHER  AS TO THOSE WHO BELIEVED BUT CAME NOT INTO EXILE YE OWE NO DUTY OF PROTECTION TO THEM UNTIL THEY SEEK YOUR AID IN RELIGION IT IS YOUR DUTY TO HELP THEM EXCEPT AGAINST A PEOPLE WITH WHOM YE HAVE A TREATY OF MUTUAL ALLIANCE  AND  REMEMBER  GOD SEETH ALL THAT YE DO 
   THE UNBELIEVERS ARE PROTECTORS ONE OF ANOTHER  UNLESS YE DO THIS  PROTECT EACH OTHER  THERE WOULD BE TUMULT AND OPPRESSION ON EARTH AND GREAT MISCHIEF 
   THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND ADOPT EXILE AND FIGHT FOR THE FAITH IN THE CAUSE OF GOD AS WELL AS THOSE WHO GIVE  THEM  ASYLUM AND AID THESE ARE  ALL  IN VERY TRUTH THE BELIEVERS  FOR THEM IS THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS AND A PROVISION MOST GENEROUS 
   AND THOSE WHO ACCEPT FAITH SUBSEQUENTLY AND ADOPT EXILE AND FIGHT FOR THE FAITH IN YOUR COMPANY THEY ARE OF YOU  BUT KINDRED BY BLOOD HAVE PRIOR RIGHTS AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THE BOOK OF GOD  VERILY GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THINGS 
   A  DECLARATION  OF IMMUNITY FROM GOD AND HIS APOSTLE TO THOSE OF THE PAGANS WITH WHOM YE HAVE CONTRACTED MUTUAL ALLIANCES 
   GO YE THEN FOR FOUR MONTHS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS  AS YE WILL  THROUGHOUT THE LAND BUT KNOW YE THAT YE CANNOT FRUSTRATE GOD  BY YOUR FALSEHOOD  BUT THAT GOD WILL COVER WITH SHAME THOSE WHO REJECT HIM 
   AND AN ANNOUNCEMENT FROM GOD AND HIS APOSTLE TO THE PEOPLE  ASSEMBLED  ON THE DAY OF THE GREAT PILGRIMAGE THAT GOD AND HIS APOSTLE DISSOLVE  TREATY  OBLIGATIONS WITH THE PAGANS  IF THEN YE REPENT IT WERE BEST FOR YOU  BUT IF YE TURN AWAY KNOW YE THAT YE CANNOT FRUSTRATE GOD  AND PROCLAIM A GRIEVOUS PENALTY TO THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH 
    BUT THE TREATIES ARE  NOT DISSOLVED WITH THOSE PAGANS WITH WHOM YE HAVE ENTERED INTO ALLIANCE AND WHO HAVE NOT SUBSEQUENTLY FAILED YOU IN AUGHT NOR AIDED ANYONE AGAINST YOU  SO FULFIL YOUR ENGAGEMENTS WITH THEM TO THE END OF THEIR TERM  FOR GOD LOVETH THE RIGHTEOUS 
   BUT WHEN THE FORBIDDEN MONTHS ARE PAST THEN FIGHT AND SLAY THE PAGANS WHEREVER YE FIND THEM AND SEIZE THEM BELEAGUER THEM AND LIE IN WAIT FOR THEM IN EVERY STRATAGEM  OF WAR   BUT IF THEY REPENT AND ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS AND PRACTICE REGULAR CHARITY THEN OPEN THE WAY FOR THEM  FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   IF ONE AMONGST THE PAGANS ASK THEE FOR ASYLUM GRANT IT TO HIM SO THAT HE MAY HEAR THE WORD OF GOD AND THEN ESCORT HIM TO WHERE HE CAN BE SECURE  THAT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE MEN WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE SECTION  
    HOW CAN THERE BE A LEAGUE BEFORE GOD AND HIS APOSTLE WITH THE PAGANS EXCEPT THOSE WITH WHOM YE MADE A TREATY NEAR THE SACRED MOSQUE  AS LONG AS THESE STAND TRUE TO YOU STAND YE TRUE TO THEM  FOR GOD DOTH LOVE THE RIGHTEOUS 
   HOW  CAN THERE BE SUCH A LEAGUE  SEEING THAT IF THEY GET AN ADVANTAGE OVER YOU THEY RESPECT NOT IN YOU THE TIES EITHER OF KINSHIP OR OF COVENANT  WITH  FAIR WORDS FROM  THEIR MOUTHS THEY ENTICE YOU BUT THEIR HEARTS ARE AVERSE FROM YOU  AND MOST OF THEM ARE REBELLIOUS AND WICKED 
   THE SIGNS OF GOD HAVE THEY SOLD FOR A MISERABLE PRICE AND  MANY  HAVE THEY HINDERED FROM HIS WAY  EVIL INDEED ARE THE DEEDS THEY HAVE DONE 
   IN A BELIEVER THEY RESPECT NOT THE TIES EITHER OF KINSHIP OR OF COVENANT  IT IS THEY WHO HAVE TRANSGRESSED ALL BOUNDS 
   BUT  EVEN SO  IF THEY REPENT ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS AND PRACTICE REGULAR CHARITY THEY ARE YOUR BRETHREN IN FAITH   THUS  DO WE EXPLAIN SIGNS IN DETAIL FOR THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND 
   BUT IF THEY VIOLATE THEIR OATHS AFTER THEIR COVENANT AND TAUNT YOU FOR YOUR FAITH FIGHT YE THE CHIEFS OF UNFAITH  FOR THEIR OATHS ARE NOTHING TO THEM  THAT THUS THEY MAY BE RESTRAINED 
   WILL YE NOT FIGHT PEOPLE WHO VIOLATED THEIR OATHS PLOTTED TO EXPEL THE APOSTLE AND TOOK THE AGGRESSIVE BY BEING THE FIRST  TO ASSAULT  YOU  DO YE FEAR THEM  NAY IT IS GOD WHOM YE SHOULD MORE JUSTLY FEAR IF YE BELIEVE 
   FIGHT THEM AND GOD WILL PUNISH THEM BY YOUR HANDS COVER THEM WITH SHAME HELP YOU  TO VICTORY  OVER THEM HEAL THE BREASTS OF BELIEVERS 
   AND STILL THE INDIGNATION OF THEIR HEARTS  FOR GOD WILL TURN  IN MERCY  TO WHOM HE WILL  AND GOD IS ALL KNOWING ALL WISE 
   OR THINK YE THAT YE SHALL BE ABANDONED AS THOUGH GOD DID NOT KNOW THOSE AMONG YOU WHO STRIVE WITH MIGHT AND MAIN AND TAKE NONE FOR FRIENDS AND PROTECTORS EXCEPT GOD HIS APOSTLE AND THE  COMMUNITY OF  BELIEVERS  BUT GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH  ALL  THAT YE DO SECTION  
   IT IS NOT FOR SUCH AS JOIN GODS WITH GOD TO VISIT OR MAINTAIN THE MOSQUES OF GOD WHILE THEY WITNESS AGAINST THEIR OWN SOULS TO INFIDELITY  THE WORKS OF SUCH BEAR NO FRUIT  IN FIRE SHALL THEY DWELL 
   THE MOSQUES OF GOD SHALL BE VISITED AND MAINTAINED BY SUCH AS BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS AND PRACTICE REGULAR CHARITY AND FEAR NONE  AT ALL  EXCEPT GOD  IT IS THEY WHO ARE EXPECTED TO BE ON TRUE GUIDANCE 
   DO YE MAKE THE GIVING OF DRINK TO PILGRIMS OR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE SACRED MOSQUE EQUAL TO  THE PIOUS SERVICE OF  THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY AND STRIVE WITH MIGHT AND MAIN IN THE CAUSE OF GOD  THEY ARE NOT COMPARABLE IN THE SIGHT OF GOD  AND GOD GUIDES NOT THOSE WHO DO WRONG 
   THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND SUFFER EXILE AND STRIVE WITH MIGHT AND MAIN IN GOD S CAUSE WITH THEIR GOODS AND THEIR PERSONS HAVE THE HIGHEST RANK IN THE SIGHT OF GOD  THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WILL ACHIEVE  SALVATION  
   THEIR LORD DOTH GIVE THEM GLAD TIDINGS OF A MERCY FROM HIMSELF OF HIS GOOD PLEASURE AND OF GARDENS FOR THEM WHEREIN ARE DELIGHTS THAT ENDURE 
   THEY WILL DWELL THEREIN FOREVER  VERILY IN GOD S PRESENCE IS A REWARD THE GREATEST  OF ALL  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  TAKE NOT FOR PROTECTORS YOUR FATHERS AND YOUR BROTHERS IF THEY LOVE INFIDELITY ABOVE FAITH  IF ANY OF YOU DO SO THEY DO WRONG 
   SAY  IF IT BE THAT YOUR FATHERS YOUR SONS YOUR BROTHERS YOUR MATES OR YOUR KINDRED  THE WEALTH THAT YE HAVE GAINED  THE COMMERCE IN WHICH YE FEAR A DECLINE  OR THE DWELLINGS IN WHICH YE DELIGHT ARE DEARER TO YOU THAN GOD OR HIS APOSTLE OR THE STRIVING IN HIS CAUSE  THEN WAIT UNTIL GOD BRINGS ABOUT HIS DECISION  AND GOD GUIDES NOT THE REBELLIOUS SECTION  
   ASSUREDLY GOD DID HELP YOU IN MANY BATTLE FIELDS AND ON THE DAY OF HUNAIN  BEHOLD  YOUR GREAT NUMBERS ELATED YOU BUT THEY AVAILED YOU NAUGHT  THE LAND FOR ALL THAT IT IS WIDE DID CONSTRAIN YOU AND YE TURNED BACK IN RETREAT 
   BUT GOD DID POUR HIS CALM ON THE APOSTLE AND ON THE BELIEVERS AND SENT DOWN FORCES WHICH YE SAW NOT  HE PUNISHED THE UNBELIEVERS  THUS DOTH HE REWARD THOSE WITHOUT FAITH 
   AGAIN WILL GOD AFTER THIS TURN  IN MERCY  TO WHOM HE WILL  FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  TRULY THE PAGANS ARE UNCLEAN  SO LET THEM NOT AFTER THIS YEAR OF THEIRS APPROACH THE SACRED MOSQUE  AND IF YE FEAR POVERTY SOON WILL GOD ENRICH YOU IF HE WILLS OUT OF HIS BOUNTY FOR GOD IS ALL KNOWING ALL WISE 
   FIGHT THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT IN GOD NOR THE LAST DAY NOR HOLD THAT FORBIDDEN WHICH HATH BEEN FORBIDDEN BY GOD AND HIS APOSTLE NOR ACKNOWLEDGE THE RELIGION OF TRUTH  EVEN IF THEY ARE  OF THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK UNTIL THEY PAY THE JIZYA WITH WILLING SUBMISSION AND FEEL THEMSELVES SUBDUED SECTION  
   THE JEWS CALL UZAIR A SON OF GOD AND THE CHRISTIANS CALL CHRIST THE SON OF GOD  THAT IS A SAYING FROM THEIR MOUTHS   IN THIS  THEY BUT IMITATE WHAT THE UNBELIEVERS OF OLD USED TO SAY  GOD S CURSE BE ON THEM  HOW THEY ARE DELUDED AWAY FROM THE TRUTH 
   THEY TAKE THEIR PRIESTS AND THEIR ANCHORITES TO BE THEIR LORDS IN DEROGATION OF GOD AND  THEY TAKE AS THEIR LORD  CHRIST THE SON OF MARY  YET THEY WERE COMMANDED TO WORSHIP BUT ONE GOD  THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE  PRAISE AND GLORY TO HIM   FAR IS HE  FROM HAVING THE PARENTS THEY ASSOCIATE  WITH HIM  
   FAIN WOULD THEY EXTINGUISH GOD S LIGHT WITH THEIR MOUTHS BUT GOD WILL NOT ALLOW BUT THAT HIS LIGHT SHOULD BE PERFECTED EVEN THOUGH THE UNBELIEVERS MAY DETEST  IT  
   IT IS HE WHO HATH SENT HIS APOSTLE WITH GUIDANCE AND RELIGION OF TRUTH TO PROCLAIM IT OVER ALL RELIGIONS EVEN THOUGH THE PAGANS MAY DETEST  IT  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  THERE ARE INDEED MANY AMONG THE PRIESTS AND ANCHORITES WHO IN FALSE HOOD DEVOUR THE SUBSTANCE OF MEN AND HINDER  THEM  FROM THE WAY OF GOD  AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO BURY GOLD AND SILVER AND SPEND IT NOT IN THE WAY OF GOD  ANNOUNCE UNTO THEM A MOST GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   ON THE DAY WHEN HEAT WILL BE PRODUCED OUT OF THAT  WEALTH  IN THE FIRE OF HELL AND WITH IT WILL BE BRANDED THEIR FOREHEADS THEIR FLANKS AND THEIR BACKS  THIS IS THE  TREASURE  WHICH YE BURIED FOR YOURSELVES  TASTE YE THEN THE  TREASURES  YE BURIED  
   THE NUMBER OF MONTHS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD IS TWELVE  IN A YEAR  SO ORDAINED BY HIM THE DAY HE CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  OF THEM FOUR ARE SACRED  THAT IS THE STRAIGHT USAGE  SO WRONG NOT YOURSELVES THEREIN AND FIGHT THE PAGANS ALL TOGETHER AS THEY FIGHT YOU ALL TOGETHER  BUT KNOW THAT GOD IS WITH THOSE WHO RESTRAIN THEMSELVES 
   VERILY THE TRANSPOSING  OF A PROHIBITED MONTH  IS AN ADDITION TO UNBELIEF  THE UNBELIEVERS ARE LED TO WRONG THEREBY  FOR THEY MAKE IT LAWFUL ONE YEAR AND FORBIDDEN ANOTHER YEAR IN ORDER TO ADJUST THE NUMBER OF MONTHS FORBIDDEN BY GOD AND MAKE SUCH FORBIDDEN ONES LAWFUL  THE EVIL OF THEIR COURSE SEEMS PLEASING TO THEM  BUT GOD GUIDETH NOT THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU THEN WHEN YE ARE ASKED TO GO FORTH IN THE CAUSE OF GOD YE CLING HEAVILY TO THE EARTH  DO YE PREFER THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD TO THE HEREAFTER  BUT LITTLE IS THE COMFORT OF THIS LIFE AS COMPARED WITH THE HEREAFTER 
   UNLESS YE GO FORTH HE WILL PUNISH YOU WITH A GRIEVOUS PENALTY AND PUT OTHERS IN YOUR PLACE  BUT HIM YE WOULD NOT HARM IN THE LEAST  FOR GOD HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   IF YE HELP NOT  YOUR LEADER   IT IS NO MATTER   FOR GOD DID INDEED HELP HIM  WHEN THE UNBELIEVERS DROVE HIM OUT  HE HAD NO MORE THAN ONE COMPANION  THEY TWO WERE IN THE CAVE AND HE SAID TO HIS COMPANION  HAVE NO FEAR FOR GOD IS WITH US   THEN GOD SENT DOWN HIS PEACE UPON HIM AND STRENGTHENED HIM WITH FORCES WHICH YE SAW NOT AND HUMBLED TO THE DEPTHS THE WORD OF THE UNBELIEVERS  BUT THE WORD OF GOD IS EXALTED TO THE HEIGHTS  FOR GOD IS EXALTED IN MIGHT WISE 
   GO YE FORTH  WHETHER EQUIPPED  LIGHTLY OR HEAVILY AND STRIVE AND STRUGGLE WITH YOUR GOODS AND YOUR PERSONS IN THE CAUSE OF GOD  THAT IS BEST FOR YOU IF YE  BUT  KNEW 
   IF THERE HAD BEEN IMMEDIATE GAIN  IN SIGHT  AND THE JOURNEY EASY THEY WOULD  ALL  WITHOUT DOUBT HAVE FOLLOWED THEE BUT THE DISTANCE WAS LONG  AND WEIGHED  ON THEM  THEY WOULD INDEED SWEAR BY GOD  IF WE ONLY COULD WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE COME OUT WITH YOU  THEY WOULD DESTROY THEIR OWN SOULS  FOR GOD DOTH KNOW THAT THEY ARE CERTAINLY LYING SECTION  
   ALLAH GIVE THEE GRACE  WHY DIDST THOU GRANT THEM EXEMPTION UNTIL THOSE WHO TOLD THE TRUTH WERE SEEN BY THEE IN A CLEAR LIGHT AND THOU HADST PROVED THE LIARS 
   THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY ASK THEE FOR NO EXEMPTION FROM FIGHTING WITH THEIR GOODS AND PERSONS  AND GOD KNOWETH WELL THOSE WHO DO THEIR DUTY 
   ONLY THOSE ASK THEE FOR EXEMPTION WHO BELIEVE NOT IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY AND WHOSE HEARTS ARE IN DOUBT SO THAT THEY ARE TOSSED IN THEIR DOUBTS TO AND FRO 
   IF THEY HAD INTENDED TO COME OUT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE MADE SOME PREPARATION THEREFOR  BUT GOD WAS AVERSE TO THEIR BEING SENT FORTH  SO HE MADE THEM LAG BEHIND AND THEY WERE TOLD  SIT YE AMONG THOSE WHO SIT  INACTIVE   
   IF THEY HAD COME OUT WITH YOU THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ADDED TO YOUR  STRENGTH  BUT ONLY  MADE FOR  DISORDER HURRYING TO AND FRO IN YOUR MIDST AND SOWING SEDITION AMONG YOU AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME AMONG YOU WHO WOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THEM  BUT GOD KNOWETH WELL THOSE WHO DO WRONG 
   INDEED THEY HAD PLOTTED SEDITION BEFORE AND UPSET MATTERS FOR THEE UNTIL THE TRUTH ARRIVED AND THE DECREE OF GOD BECAME MANIFEST MUCH TO THEIR DISGUST 
   AMONG THEM IS  MANY  A MAN WHO SAYS   GRANT ME EXEMPTION AND DRAW ME NOT INTO TRIAL   HAVE THEY NOT FALLEN INTO TRIAL ALREADY  AND INDEED HELL SURROUNDS THE UNBELIEVERS  ON ALL SIDES  
   IF GOOD BEFALLS THEE IT GRIEVES THEM  BUT IF A MISFORTUNE BEFALLS THEE THEY SAY  WE TOOK INDEED OUR PRECAUTIONS BEFOREHAND  AND THEY TURN AWAY REJOICING 
   SAY   NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO US EXCEPT WHAT GOD HAS DECREED FOR US  HE IS OUR PROTECTOR   AND ON GOD LET THE BELIEVERS PUT THEIR TRUST 
   SAY   CAN YOU EXPECT FOR US  ANY FATE  OTHER THAN ONE OF TWO GLORIOUS THINGS  MARTYRDOM OR VICTORY   BUT WE CAN EXPECT FOR YOU EITHER THAT GOD WILL SEND HIS PUNISHMENT FORM HIMSELF OR BY OUR HANDS  SO WAIT  EXPECTANT   WE TOO WILL WAIT WITH YOU  
   SAY   SPEND  FOR THE CAUSE  WILLINGLY OR UNWILLINGLY  NOT FROM YOU WILL IT BE ACCEPTED  FOR YE ARE INDEED A PEOPLE REBELLIOUS AND WICKED  
   THE ONLY REASONS WHY THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTED ARE  THAT THEY REJECT GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  THAT THEY COME TO PRAYER WITHOUT EARNESTNESS  AND THAT THEY OFFER CONTRIBUTIONS UNWILLINGLY 
   LET NOT THEIR WEALTH NOR THEIR  FOLLOWING IN  SONS DAZZLE THEE  IN REALITY GOD S PLAN IS TO PUNISH THEM WITH THESE THINGS IN THIS LIFE AND THAT THEIR SOULS MAY PERISH IN THEIR  VERY  DENIAL OF GOD 
   THEY SWEAR BY GOD THAT THEY ARE INDEED OF YOU  BUT THEY ARE NOT OF YOU  YET THEY ARE AFRAID  TO APPEAR IN THEIR TRUE COLORS  
   IF THEY COULD FIND A PLACE TO FLEE TO OR CAVES OR A PLACE OF CONCEALMENT THEY WOULD TURN STRAIGHTWAY THERETO WITH AN OBSTINATE RUSH 
   AND AMONG THEM ARE MEN WHO SLANDER THEE IN THE MATTER OF  THE DISTRIBUTION OF  THE ALMS  IF THEY ARE GIVEN PART THEREOF THEY ARE PLEASED BUT IF NOT BEHOLD  THEY ARE INDIGNANT 
   IF ONLY THEY HAD BEEN CONTENT WITH WHAT GOD AND HIS APOSTLE GAVE THEM AND HAD SAID  SUFFICIENT UNTO US IS GOD  GOD AND HIS APOSTLE WILL SOON GIVE US OF HIS BOUNTY  TO GOD DO WE TURN OUR HOPES    THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT COURSE  SECTION  
   ALMS ARE FOR THE POOR AND THE NEEDY AND THOSE EMPLOYED TO ADMINISTER THE  FUNDS   FOR THOSE WHOSE HEARTS HAVE BEEN  RECENTLY  RECONCILED  TO TRUTH   FOR THOSE IN BONDAGE AND IN DEBT  IN THE CAUSE OF GOD  AND FOR THE WAYFARER   THUS IS IT  ORDAINED BY GOD AND GOD IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM 
   AMONG THEM ARE MEN WHO MOLEST THE PROPHET AND SAY  HE IS  ALL  EAR   SAY  HE LISTENS TO WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU  HE BELIEVES IN GOD HAS FAITH IN THE BELIEVERS AND IS A MERCY TO THOSE OF YOU WHO BELIEVE   BUT THOSE WHO MOLEST THE APOSTLE WILL HAVE A GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   TO YOU THEY SWEAR BY GOD  IN ORDER TO PLEASE YOU  BUT IT IS MORE FITTING THAT THEY SHOULD PLEASE GOD AND HIS APOSTLE IF THEY ARE BELIEVERS 
   KNOW THEY NOT THAT FOR THOSE WHO OPPOSE GOD AND HIS APOSTLE IS THE FIRE OF HELL  WHEREIN THEY SHALL DWELL  THAT IS THE SUPREME DISGRACE 
   THE HYPOCRITES ARE AFRAID LEST A SURAH SHOULD BE SENT DOWN ABOUT THEM SHOWING THEM WHAT IS  REALLY PASSING  IN THEIR HEARTS  SAY   MOCK YE  BUT VERILY GOD WILL BRING TO LIGHT ALL THAT YE FEAR  SHOULD BE REVEALED   
   IF THOU DOST QUESTION THEM THEY DECLARE  WITH EMPHASIS    WE WERE ONLY TALKING IDLY AND IN PLAY   SAY   WAS IT AT GOD AND HIS SIGNS AND HIS APOSTLE THAT YE WERE MOCKING  
   MAKE YE NO EXCUSES  YE HAVE REJECTED FAITH AFTER YE HAD ACCEPTED IT  IF WE PARDON SOME OF YOU WE WILL PUNISH OTHERS AMONGST YOU FOR THAT THEY ARE IN SIN SECTION  
   THE HYPOCRITES MEN AND WOMEN  HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING  WITH EACH OTHER  THEY ENJOIN EVIL AND FORBID WHAT IN JUST AND ARE CLOSE WITH THEIR HANDS  THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN GOD  SO HE HATH FORGOTTEN THEM  VERILY THE HYPOCRITES ARE REBELLIOUS AND PERVERSE 
   GOD HATH PROMISED THE HYPOCRITES MEN AND WOMEN AND THE REJECTERS OF FAITH THE FIRE OF HELL  THEREIN SHALL THEY DWELL  SUFFICIENT IS IT FOR THEM  FOR THEM IS THE CURSE OF GOD AND AN ENDURING PUNISHMENT
   AS IN THE CASE OF THOSE BEFORE YOU  THEY WERE MIGHTIER THAN YOU IN POWER AND MORE FLOURISHING IN WEALTH AND CHILDREN  THEY HAD THEIR ENJOYMENT OF THEIR PORTION  AND YE HAVE OF YOURS AS DID THOSE BEFORE YOU  AND YE INDULGE IN IDLE TALK AS THEY DID  THEY  THEIR WORKS ARE FRUITLESS IN THIS WORLD AND IN THE HEREAFTER AND THEY WILL LOSE  ALL SPIRITUAL GOOD  
   HATH NOT THE STORY REACHED THEM OF THOSE BEFORE THEM  THE PEOPLE OF NOAH AND AD AND THAMUD  THE PEOPLE OF ABRAHAM THE MEN OF MADYAN AND THE CITIES OVERTHROWN  TO THEM CAME THEIR APOSTLES WITH CLEAR SIGNS  IT IS NOT GOD WHO WRONGS THEM BUT THEY WRONG THEIR OWN SOULS 
   THE BELIEVERS MEN AND WOMEN ARE PROTECTORS ONE OF ANOTHER  THEY ENJOIN WHAT IS JUST AND FORBID WHAT IS EVIL  THEY OBSERVE REGULAR PRAYERS PRACTICE REGULAR CHARITY AND OBEY GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  ON THEM WILL GOD POUR HIS MERCY  FOR GOD IS EXALTED IN POWER WISE 
   GOD HATH PROMISED TO BELIEVERS MEN AND WOMEN GARDENS UNDER WHICH RIVERS FLOW TO DWELL THEREIN AND BEAUTIFUL MANSIONS IN GARDENS OF EVERLASTING BLISS  BUT THE GREATEST BLISS IN THE GOOD PLEASURE OF GOD  THAT IS THE SUPREME FELICITY SECTION  
   O PROPHET  STRIVE HARD AGAINST THE UNBELIEVERS AND THE HYPOCRITES AND BE FIRM AGAINST THEM  THEIR ABODE IS HELL AN EVIL REFUGE INDEED 
   THEY SWEAR BY GOD THAT THEY SAID NOTHING  EVIL  BUT INDEED THEY UTTERED BLASPHEMY AND THEY DID IT AFTER ACCEPTING ISLAM  AND THEY MEDITATED A PLOT WHICH THEY WERE ENABLE TO CARRY OUT  THIS REVENGE OF THEIRS WAS  THEIR  ONLY RETURN FOR THE BOUNTY WITH WHICH GOD AND HIS APOSTLE HAD ENRICHED THEM  IF THEY REPENT IT WILL BE BEST FOR THEM  BUT IF THEY TURN BACK  TO THEIR EVIL WAYS  GOD WILL PUNISH THEM WITH A GRIEVOUS PENALTY IN THIS LIFE AND IN THE HEREAFTER  THEY SHALL HAVE NONE ON EARTH TO PROTECT OR HELP THEM 
   AMONGST THEM ARE MEN WHO MADE A COVENANT WITH GOD THAT IF HE BESTOWED ON THEM OF HIS BOUNTY THEY WOULD GIVE  LARGELY  IN CHARITY AND BE TRULY AMONGST THOSE WHO ARE RIGHTEOUS 
   BUT WHEN HE DID BESTOW OF HIS BOUNTY THEY BECAME COVETOUS AND TURNED BACK  FROM THEIR COVENANT  AVERSE  FROM ITS FULFILLMENT  
   SO HE HATH PUT AS A CONSEQUENCE HYPOCRISY INTO THEIR HEARTS  TO LAST  TILL THE DAY WHEREON THEY SHALL MEET HIM  BECAUSE THEY BROKE THEIR COVENANT WITH GOD AND BECAUSE THEY LIED  AGAIN AND AGAIN  
   KNOW THEY NOT THAT GOD DOTH KNOW THEIR SECRET  THOUGHTS  AND THEIR SECRET COUNSELS AND THAT GOD KNOWETH WELL ALL THINGS UNSEEN 
   THOSE WHO SLANDER SUCH OF THE BELIEVERS AS GIVE THEMSELVES FREELY TO  DEEDS OF  CHARITY AS WELL AS SUCH AS CAN FIND NOTHING TO GIVE EXCEPT THE FRUITS OF THEIR LABOR AND THROW RIDICULE ON THEM GOD WILL THROW BACK THEIR RIDICULE ON THEM  AND THEY SHALL HAVE A GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   WHETHER THOU ASK FOR THEIR FORGIVENESS OR NOT  THEIR SIN IS UNFORGIVABLE   IF THOU ASK SEVENTY TIMES FOR THEIR FORGIVENESS GOD WILL NOT FORGIVE THEM  BECAUSE THEY HAVE REJECTED GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  AND GOD GUIDETH NOT THOSE WHO ARE PERVERSELY REBELLIOUS SECTION  
   THOSE WHO WERE LEFT BEHIND  IN THE TABUK EXPEDITION  REJOICED IN THEIR INACTION BEHIND THE BACK OF THE APOSTLE OF GOD  THEY HATED TO STRIVE AND FIGHT WITH THEIR GOODS AND THEIR PERSONS IN THE CAUSE OF GOD  THEY SAID  GO NOT FORTH IN THE HEAT  SAY  THE FIRE OF HELL IS FIERCER IN HEAT   IF ONLY THEY COULD UNDERSTAND 
   LET THEM LAUGH A LITTLE  MUCH WILL THEY WEEP  A RECOMPENSE FOR THE  EVIL  THAT THEY DO 
   IF THEN GOD BRING THEE BACK TO ANY OF THEM AND THEY ASK THY PERMISSION TO COME OUT  WITH THEE  SAY   NEVER SHALL YE COME OUT WITH ME NOR FIGHT AN ENEMY WITH ME  FOR YE PREFERRED TO SIT INACTIVE ON THE FIRST OCCASION  THEN SIT YE  NOW  WITH THOSE WHO LAG BEHIND  
   NOR DO THOU EVER PRAY FOR ANY OF THEM THAT DIES NOR STAND AT HIS GRAVE  FOR THEY REJECTED GOD AND HIS APOSTLE AND DIED IN A STATE OF PERVERSE REBELLION 
   NOR LET THEIR WEALTH NOR THEIR  FOLLOWING IN  SONS DAZZLE THEE  GOD S PLAN IS TO PUNISH THEM WITH THESE THINGS IN THIS WORLD AND THAT THEIR SOULS MAY PERISH IN THEIR  VERY  DENIAL OF GOD 
   WHEN A SURAH COMES DOWN ENJOINING THEM TO BELIEVE IN GOD AND TO STRIVE AND FIGHT ALONG WITH HIS APOSTLE THOSE WITH WEALTH AND INFLUENCE AMONG THEM ASK THEE FOR EXEMPTION AND SAY   LEAVE US  BEHIND   WE WOULD BE WITH THOSE WHO SIT  AT HOME   
   THEY PREFER TO BE WITH  THE WOMEN  WHO REMAIN BEHIND  AT HOME   THEIR HEARTS ARE SEALED AND SO THEY UNDERSTAND NOT 
   BUT THE APOSTLE AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE WITH HIM STRIVE AND FIGHT WITH THEIR WEALTH AND THEIR PERSONS  FOR THEM ARE  ALL  GOOD THINGS  AND IT IS THEY WHO WILL PROSPER 
   GOD HATH PREPARED FOR THEM GARDENS UNDER WHICH RIVERS FLOW TO DWELL THEREIN  THAT IS THE SUPREME FELICITY SECTION  
   AND THERE WERE AMONG THE DESERT ARABS  ALSO  MEN WHO MADE EXCUSES AND CAME TO CLAIM EXEMPTION  AND THOSE WHO WERE FALSE TO GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  MERELY  SAT INACTIVE  SOON WILL A GRIEVOUS PENALTY SEIZE THE UNBELIEVERS AMONG THEM 
   THERE IS NO BLAME ON THOSE WHO ARE INFIRM OR ILL OR WHO FIND NO RESOURCES TO SPEND  ON THE CAUSE  IF THEY ARE SINCERE  IN DUTY  TO GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  NO GROUND  OF COMPLAINT  CAN THERE BE AGAINST SUCH AS DO RIGHT  AND GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   NOR  IS THERE BLAME  ON THOSE WHO CAME TO THEE TO BE PROVIDED WITH MOUNT AND WHEN THOU SAIDST  I CAN FIND NO MOUNTS FOR YOU  THEY TURNED BACK THEIR EYES STREAMING WITH TEARS OF GRIEF THAT THEY HAD NO RESOURCES WHEREWITH TO PROVIDE THE EXPENSES 
   THE GROUND  OF COMPLAINT  IS AGAINST SUCH AS CLAIM EXEMPTION WHILE THEY ARE RICH  THEY PREFER TO STAY WITH THE  WOMEN  WHO REMAIN BEHIND  GOD HATH SEALED THEIR HEARTS  SO THEY KNOW NOT  WHAT THEY MISS  
   THEY WILL PRESENT THEIR EXCUSES TO YOU WHEN YE RETURN TO THEM  SAY THOU   PRESENT NO EXCUSES  WE SHALL NOT BELIEVE YOU  GOD HATH ALREADY INFORMED US OF THE TRUE STATE OF MATTERS CONCERNING YOU  IT IS YOUR ACTIONS THAT GOD AND HIS APOSTLE WILL OBSERVE  IN THE END WILL YE BE BROUGHT BACK TO HIM WHO KNOWETH WHAT IS HIDDEN AND WHAT IS OPEN  THEN WILL HE SHOW YOU THE TRUTH OF ALL THAT YE DID 
   THEY WILL SWEAR TO YOU BY GOD WHEN YE RETURN TO THEM THAT YE MAY LEAVE THEM ALONE  SO LEAVE THEM ALONE  FOR THEY ARE AN ABOMINATION AND HELL IS THEIR DWELLING PLACE A FITTING RECOMPENSE FOR THE  EVIL  THAT THEY DID 
   THEY WILL SWEAR UNTO YOU THAT YE MAY BE PLEASED WITH THEM BUT IF YE ARE PLEASED WITH THEM GOD IS NOT PLEASED WITH THOSE WHO DISOBEY 
   THE ARABS OF THE DESERT ARE THE WORST IN UNBELIEF AND HYPOCRISY AND MOST FITTED TO BE IN IGNORANCE OF THE COMMAND WHICH GOD HATH SENT DOWN TO HIS APOSTLE  BUT GOD IS ALL KNOWING ALL WISE 
   SOME OF THE DESERT ARABS LOOK UPON THEIR PAYMENTS AS A FINE AND WATCH FOR DISASTERS FOR YOU  ON THEM BE THE DISASTER OF EVIL  FOR GOD IS HE THAT HEARETH AND KNOWETH  ALL THINGS  
   BUT SOME OF THE DESERT ARABS BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY AND LOOK ON THEIR PAYMENTS AS PIOUS GIFTS BRINGING THEM NEARER TO GOD AND OBTAINING THE PRAYERS OF THE APOSTLE  AYE INDEED THEY BRING THEM NEARER  TO HIM   SOON WILL GOD ADMIT THEM TO HIS MERCY  FOR GOD IS OFT  FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL SECTION  
   THE VANGUARD  OF ISLAM  THE FIRST OF THOSE WHO FORSOOK  THEIR HOMES  AND OF THOSE WHO GAVE THEM AID AND  ALSO  THOSE WHO FOLLOW THEM IN  ALL  GOOD DEEDS WELL PLEASED IS GOD WITH THEM AS ARE THEY WITH HIM  FOR THEM HATH HE PREPARED GARDENS UNDER WHICH RIVERS FLOW TO DWELL THEREIN FOR EVER  THAT IS THE SUPREME FELICITY 
   CERTAIN OF THE DESERT ARABS ROUND ABOUT YOU ARE HYPOCRITES AS WELL AS  DESERT ARABS  AMONG THE MEDINA FOLK  THEY ARE OBSTINATE IN HYPOCRISY  THOU KNOWEST THEM NOT  WE KNOW THEM  TWICE SHALL WE PUNISH THEM AND IN ADDITION SHALL THEY BE SENT TO A GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   OTHERS  THERE ARE WHO  HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR WRONG DOINGS  THEY HAVE MIXED AN ACT THAT WAS GOOD WITH ANOTHER THAT WAS EVIL  PERHAPS GOD WILL TURN UNTO THEM  IN MERCY   FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   OF THEIR GOODS TAKE ALMS THAT SO THOU MIGHTEST PURIFY AND SANCTIFY THEM  AND PRAY ON THEIR BEHALF  VERILY THY PRAYERS ARE A SOURCE OF SECURITY FOR THEM  AND GOD IS ONE WHO HEARETH AND KNOWETH 
   KNOW THEY NOT THAT GOD DOTH ACCEPT REPENTANCE FROM HIS VOTARIES AND RECEIVES THEIR GIFTS OF CHARITY AND THAT GOD IS VERILY HE THE OFT  RETURNING MOST MERCIFUL

   THERE ARE  YET  OTHERS HELD IN SUSPENSE FOR THE COMMAND OF GOD WHETHER HE WILL PUNISH THEM OR TURN IN MERCY TO THEM  AND GOD IS ALL  KNOWING WISE 
   AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO PUT UP A MOSQUE BY WAY OF MISCHIEF AND INFIDELITY TO DISUNITE THE BELIEVERS AND IN PREPARATION FOR ONE WHO WARRED AGAINST GOD AND HIS APOSTLE AFORETIME  THEY WILL INDEED SWEAR THAT THEIR INTENTION IS NOTHING BUT GOOD  BUT GOD DOTH DECLARE THAT THEY ARE CERTAINLY LIARS 
   NEVER STAND THOU FORTH THEREIN  THERE IS A MOSQUE WHOSE FOUNDATION WAS LAID FROM THE FIRST DAY ON PIETY  IT IS MORE WORTHY OF THY STANDING FORTH  FOR PRAYER  THEREIN  IN IT ARE MEN WHO LOVE TO BE PURIFIED  AND GOD LOVETH THOSE WHO MAKE THEMSELVES PURE 
   WHICH THEN IS BEST  HE THAT LAYETH HIS FOUNDATION ON PIETY TO GOD AND HIS GOOD PLEASURE  OR HE THAT LAYETH HIS FOUNDATION ON AN UNDERMINED SAND CLIFF READY TO CRUMBLE TO PIECES  AND IT DOTH CRUMBLE TO PIECES WITH HIM INTO THE FIRE OF HELL  AND GOD GUIDETH NOT PEOPLE THAT DO WRONG 
   THE FOUNDATION OF THOSE WHO SO BUILD IS NEVER FREE FROM SUSPICION AND SHAKINESS IN THEIR HEARTS UNTIL THEIR HEARTS ARE CUT TO PIECES  AND GOD IS ALL KNOWING WISE SECTION  
   ALLAH HATH PURCHASED OF THE BELIEVERS THEIR PERSONS AND THEIR GOOD  FOR THEIRS  IN RETURN  IS THE GARDEN  OF PARADISE   THEY FIGHT IN HIS CAUSE AND SLAY AND ARE SLAIN  A PROMISE BINDING ON HIM IN TRUTH THROUGH THE LAW THE GOSPEL AND THE QUR AN  AND WHO IS MORE FAITHFUL TO HIS COVENANT THAN GOD  THEN REJOICE IN THE BARGAIN WHICH YE HAVE CONCLUDED  THAT IS THE ACHIEVEMENT SUPREME 
   THOSE THAT TURN  TO GOD  IN REPENTANCE  THAT SERVE HIM AND PRAISE HIM  THAT WANDER IN DEVOTION TO THE CAUSE OF GOD  THAT BOW DOWN AND PROSTRATE THEMSELVES IN PRAYER  THAT ENJOIN GOOD AND FORBID EVIL  AND OBSERVE THE LIMITS SET BY GOD   THESE DO REJOICE   SO PROCLAIM THE GLAD TIDINGS TO THE BELIEVERS 
   IT IS NOT FITTING FOR THE PROPHET AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS FOR PAGANS EVEN THOUGH THEY BE OF KIN AFTER IT IS CLEAR TO THEM THAT THEY ARE COMPANIONS OF THE FIRE 
   AND ABRAHAM PRAYED FOR HIS FATHER S FORGIVENESS ONLY BECAUSE OF A PROMISE HE HAD MADE TO HIM  BUT WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR TO HIM THAT HE WAS AN ENEMY TO GOD HE DISSOCIATED HIMSELF FROM HIM  FOR ABRAHAM WAS MOST TENDER HEARTED FORBEARING 
   AND GOD WILL NOT MISLEAD A PEOPLE AFTER HE HATH GUIDED THEM IN ORDER THAT HE MAY MAKE CLEAR TO THEM WHAT TO FEAR  AND AVOID  FOR GOD HATH KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THINGS 
   UNTO GOD BELONGETH THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  HE GIVETH LIFE AND HE TAKETH IT  EXCEPT FOR HIM YE HAVE NO PROTECTOR NOR HELPER 
   GOD TURNED WITH FAVOR TO THE PROPHET THE MUHAJIRS AND THE ANSAR WHO FOLLOWED HIM IN A TIME OF DISTRESS AFTER THAT THE HEARTS OF A PART OF THEM HAD NEARLY SWERVED  FROM DUTY   BUT HE TURNED TO THEM  ALSO   FOR HE IS UNTO THEM MOST KIND MOST MERCIFUL 
    HE TURNED IN MERCY ALSO  TO THE THREE WHO WERE LEFT BEHIND   THEY FELT GUILTY  TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE EARTH SEEMED CONSTRAINED TO THEM FOR ALL ITS SPECIOUSNESS AND THEIR  VERY  SOULS SEEMED STRAITENED TO THEM AND THEY PERCEIVED THAT THERE IS NO FLEEING FROM GOD AND NO REFUGE BUT TO HIMSELF  THEN HE TURNED TO THEM THAT THEY MIGHT REPENT  FOR GOD IS OFT RETURNING MOST MERCIFUL SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  FEAR GOD AND BE WITH THOSE WHO ARE TRUE  IN WORD AND DEED  
   IT WAS NOT FITTING FOR THE PEOPLE OF MEDINA AND THE BEDOUIN ARABS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO REFUSE TO FOLLOW GOD S APOSTLE NOR TO PREFER THEIR OWN LIVES TO HIS  BECAUSE NOTHING COULD THEY SUFFER OR DO BUT WAS RECKONED TO THEIR CREDIT AS A DEED OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WHETHER THEY SUFFERED THIRST OR FATIGUE OR HUNGER IN THE CAUSE OF GOD OR TROD PATHS TO RAISE THE IRE OF THE UNBELIEVERS OR RECEIVED ANY INJURY WHATEVER FROM AN ENEMY  FOR GOD SUFFERETH NOT THE REWARD TO BE LOST OF THOSE WHO DO GOOD 
   NOR COULD THEY SPEND ANYTHING  FOR THE CAUSE  SMALL OR GREAT NOR CUT ACROSS A VALLEY BUT THE DEED IS INSCRIBED TO THEIR CREDIT  THAT GOD MIGHT REQUITE THEIR DEED WITH THE BEST  POSSIBLE REWARD  
   NOR SHOULD THE BELIEVERS ALL GO FORTH TOGETHER  IF A CONTINGENT FROM EVERY EXPEDITION REMAINED BEHIND THEY COULD DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO STUDIES IN RELIGION AND ADMONISH THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY RETURN TO THEM THAT THUS THEY  MAY LEARN  TO GUARD THEMSELVES  AGAINST EVIL  SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  FIGHT THE UNBELIEVERS WHO GIRD YOU ABOUT AND LET THEM FIND FIRMNESS IN YOU  AND KNOW THAT GOD IS WITH THOSE WHO FEAR HIM 
   WHENEVER THERE COMETH DOWN A SURAH SOME OF THEM SAY   WHICH OF YOU HAS HAD HIS FAITH INCREASED BY IT  YEA THOSE WHO BELIEVE THEIR FAITH IS INCREASED AND THEY DO REJOICE 
   BUT THOSE IN WHOSE HEARTS IS A DISEASE IT WILL ADD DOUBT TO THEIR DOUBT AND THEY WILL DIE IN A STATE OF UNBELIEF 
   SEE THEY NOT THAT THEY ARE TRIED EVERY YEAR ONCE OR TWICE  YET THEY TURN NOT IN REPENTANCE AND THEY TAKE NO HEED 
   WHENEVER THERE COMETH DOWN A SURAH THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER  SAYING   DOTH ANYONE SEE YOU   THEN THEY TURN ASIDE  GOD HATH TURNED THEIR HEARTS  FROM THE LIGHT   FOR THEY ARE A PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND NOT

   ALIF LAM RA  THESE ARE THE AYAT OF THE BOOK OF WISDOM 
   IT IS A MATTER OF WONDERMENT TO MEN THAT WE HAVE SET OUR INSPIRATION TO A MAN FROM AMONG THEMSELVES  THAT HE SHOULD WARN MANKIND  OF THEIR DANGER  AND GIVE THE GOOD NEWS TO THE BELIEVERS THAT THEY HAVE BEFORE THEIR LORD THE LOFTY RANK OF TRUTH  BUT  SAY THE UNBELIEVERS   THIS IS INDEED AN EVIDENT SORCERER  
   VERILY YOUR LORD IS GOD WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH IN SIX DAYS AND IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED ON THE THRONE  OF AUTHORITY  REGULATING AND GOVERNING ALL THINGS  NO INTERCESSOR  CAN PLEAD WITH HIM  EXCEPT AFTER HIS LEAVE  HATH BEEN OBTAINED   THIS IS GOD YOUR LORD  HIM THEREFORE SERVE YE  WILL YE NOT CELEBRATE HIS PRAISES 
   TO HIM WILL BE YOUR RETURN OF ALL OF YOU  THE PROMISE OF GOD IS TRUE AND SURE  IT IS HE WHO BEGINNETH THE PROCESS OF CREATION AND REPEATETH IT THAT HE MAY REWARD WITH JUSTICE THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS BUT THOSE WHO REJECT HIM WILL HAVE NOTHING BUT DRAUGHTS OF BOILING FLUIDS AND A PENALTY GRIEVOUS  BECAUSE THEY DID REJECT HIM 
   IT IS HE WHO MADE THE SUN TO BE A SHINING GLORY AND THE MOON TO BE A LIGHT  OF BEAUTY  AND MEASURED OUT STAGES FOR HER  THAT YE MIGHT KNOW THE NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE COUNT  OF TIME   NOWISE DID GOD CREATE THIS BUT IN TRUTH AND RIGHTEOUSNESS   THUS  DOTH HE EXPLAIN HIS SIGNS IN DETAIL FOR THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND

   THOSE WHO REST NOT THEIR HOPE ON THEIR MEETING WITH US BUT ARE PLEASED AND SATISFIED WITH THE LIFE OF THE PRESENT AND THOSE WHO HEED NOT OUR SIGNS
   THEIR ABODE IS THE FIRE BECAUSE OF THE  EVIL  THEY EARNED 
   THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS THEIR LORD WILL GUIDE THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR FAITH  BENEATH THEM WILL FLOW RIVERS IN GARDENS OF BLISS 
    THIS WILL BE  THEIR CRY THEREIN   GLORY TO THEE O GOD   AND  PEACE  WILL BE THEIR GREETING THEREIN  AND THE CLOSE OF THEIR CRY WILL BE   PRAISE BE TO GOD THE CHERISHER AND SUSTAINER OF THE WORLDS  SECTION  
   IF GOD WERE TO HASTEN FOR MEN THE ILL  THEY HAVE EARNED  AS THEY WOULD FAIN HASTEN ON THE GOOD THEN WOULD THEIR RESPITE BE SETTLED AT ONCE  BUT WE LEAVE THOSE WHO REST NOT THEIR HOPE OF THEIR MEETING WITH US IN THEIR TRESPASSES WANDERING IN DISTRACTION TO AND FRO 
   WHEN TROUBLE TOUCHETH A MAN HE CRIETH UNTO US  IN ALL POSTURES  LYING DOWN ON HIS SIDE OR SITTING OR STANDING  BUT WHEN WE HAVE SOLVED HIS TROUBLE HE PASSETH ON HIS WAY AS IF HE HAD NEVER CRIED TO US FOR A TROUBLE THAT TOUCHED HIM  THUS DO THE DEEDS OF TRANSGRESSORS SEEM FAIR IN THEIR EYES 
   GENERATIONS BEFORE YOU WE DESTROYED WHEN THEY DID WRONG  THEIR APOSTLES CAME TO THEM WITH CLEAR SIGNS BUT THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE  THUS DO WE REQUITE THOSE WHO SIN

   WHO DOTH MORE WRONG THAN SUCH AS FORGE A LIE AGAINST GOD OR DENY HIS SIGNS  BUT NEVER WILL PROSPER THOSE WHO SIN 
   THEY SERVE BESIDES GOD THINGS THAT HURT THEM NOT NOR PROFIT THEM AND THEY SAY   THESE ARE OUR INTERCESSORS WITH GOD   SAY   DO YE INDEED INFORM GOD OF SOMETHING HE KNOWS NOT IN THE HEAVENS OR ON EARTH  GLORY TO HIM  AND FAR IS HE ABOVE THE PARTNERS THEY ASCRIBE  TO HIM   
   MANKIND WAS BUT ONE NATION BUT DIFFERED  LATER   HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR A WORD THAT WENT FORTH BEFORE FROM THY LORD THEIR DIFFERENCES WOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED BETWEEN THEM 
   THEY SAY   WHY IS NOT A SIGN SENT DOWN TO HIM FROM HIS LORD   SAY   THE UNSEEN IS ONLY FOR GOD  TO KNOW   THEN WAIT YE  I TOO WILL WAIT WITH YOU  SECTION

   THEY REJECTED HIM BUT WE DELIVERED HIM AND THOSE WITH HIM IN THE ARK AND WE MADE THEM INHERIT  THE EARTH  WHILE WE OVERWHELMED IN THE FLOOD THOSE WHO REJECTED OUR SIGNS  THEN SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE WHO WERE WARNED  BUT HEEDED NOT  
   THEN AFTER HIM WE SENT  MANY  APOSTLES TO THEIR PEOPLES  THEY BROUGHT THEM CLEAR SIGNS BUT THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY HAD ALREADY REJECTED BEFOREHAND  THUS DO WE SEAL THE HEARTS OF THE TRANSGRESSORS 
   THEN AFTER THEM SENT WE MOSES AND AARON TO PHARAOH AND HIS CHIEFS WITH OUR SIGNS  BUT THEY WERE ARROGANT  THEY WERE A PEOPLE IN SIN 
   WHEN THE TRUTH DID COME TO THEM FROM US THEY SAID   THIS IS INDEED EVIDENT SORCERY  
   SAID MOSES   SAY YE  THIS  ABOUT THE TRUTH WHEN IT HATH  ACTUALLY  REACHED YOU  IN SORCERY  LIKE  THIS  BUT SORCERERS WILL NOT PROSPER  
   THEY SAID   HAST THOU COME TO US TO TURN US A WAY FROM THE WAYS WE FOUND OUR FATHERS FOLLOWING IN ORDER THAT THOU AND THY BROTHER MAY HAVE GREATNESS IN THE LAND  BUT NOT WE SHALL BELIEVE IN YOU  
   SAID PHARAOH   BRING ME EVERY SORCERER WELL VERSED  
   WHEN THE SORCERERS CAME MOSES SAID TO THEM   THROW YE WHAT YE  WISH  TO THROW  
   WHEN THEY HAD THEIR THROW MOSES SAID   WHAT YE HAVE BROUGHT IS SORCERY  GOD WILL SURELY MAKE IT OF NO EFFECT  FOR GOD PROSPERETH NOT THE WORK OF THOSE WHO MAKE MISCHIEF 
    AND GOD BY HIS WORDS DOTH PROVE AND ESTABLISH HIS TRUTH HOWEVER MUCH THE SINNERS MAY HATE IT  SECTION  
   BUT NONE BELIEVED IN MOSES EXCEPT SOME CHILDREN OF HIS PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF PHARAOH AND HIS CHIEFS LEST THEY SHOULD PERSECUTE THEM  AND CERTAINLY PHARAOH WAS MIGHTY ON THE EARTH AND ONE WHO TRANSGRESSED ALL BOUNDS 
   MOSES SAID   O MY PEOPLE  IF YE DO  REALLY  BELIEVE IN GOD THEN IN HIM PUT YOUR TRUST IF YE SUBMIT  YOUR WILL TO HIS   
   THEY SAID   IN GOD DO WE PUT OUR TRUST  OUR LORD  MAKE US NOT A TRIAL FOR THOSE WHO PRACTICE OPPRESSION 
    AND DELIVER US BY THY MERCY FROM THOSE WHO REJECT  THEE   
   WE INSPIRED MOSES AND HIS BROTHER WITH THIS MESSAGE   PROVIDE DWELLINGS FOR YOUR PEOPLE IN EGYPT MAKE YOUR DWELLINGS INTO PLACES OF WORSHIP AND ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS  AND GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE  
   MOSES PRAYED   OUR LORD  THOU HAST INDEED BESTOWED ON PHARAOH AND HIS CHIEFS SPLENDOR AND WEALTH IN THE LIFE OF THE PRESENT AND SO OUR LORD THEY MISLEAD  MEN  FROM THY PATH  DEFACE OUR LORD THE FEATURES OF THEIR WEALTH AND SEND HARDNESS TO THEIR HEARTS SO THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE UNTIL THEY SEE THE GRIEVOUS PENALTY  
   GOD SAID   ACCEPTED IS YOUR PRAYER  O MOSES AND AARON   SO STAND YE STRAIGHT AND FOLLOW NOT THE PATH OF THOSE WHO KNOW NOT  
   WE TOOK THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ACROSS THE SEA  PHARAOH AND HIS HOSTS FOLLOWED THEM IN INSOLENCE AND SPITE  AT LENGTH WHEN OVERWHELMED WITH THE FLOOD HE SAID   I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO GOD EXCEPT HIM WHOM THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BELIEVE IN  I AM OF THOSE WHO SUBMIT  TO GOD IN ISLAM   
    IT WAS SAID TO HIM    AH NOW  BUT A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE WAST THOU IN REBELLION  AND THOU DIDST MISCHIEF  AND VIOLENCE  
    THIS DAY SHALL WE SAVE THEE IN THY BODY THAT THOU MAYEST BE A SIGN TO THOSE WHO COME AFTER THEE  BUT VERILY MANY AMONG MANKIND ARE HEEDLESS OF OUR SIGNS  SECTION  
   WE SETTLED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL IN A BEAUTIFUL DWELLING PLACE AND PROVIDED FOR THEM SUSTENANCE OF THE BEST  IT WAS AFTER KNOWLEDGE HAD BEEN GRANTED TO THEM THAT THEY FELL INTO SCHISMS  VERILY GOD WILL JUDGE BETWEEN THEM AS TO THE SCHISMS AMONGST THEM ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 
   IF THOU WERT IN DOUBT AS TO WHAT WE HAVE REVEALED UNTO THEE THEN ASK THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN READING THE BOOK FROM BEFORE THEE  THE TRUTH HATH INDEED COME TO THEE FROM THY LORD  SO BE IN NOWISE OF THOSE IN DOUBT 
   NOR BE OF THOSE WHO REJECT THE SIGNS OF GOD OR THOU SHALT BE OF THOSE WHO PERISH 
   THOSE AGAINST WHOM THE WORD OF THY LORD HATH BEEN VERIFIED WOULD NOT BELIEVE
   EVEN IF EVERY SIGN WAS BROUGHT UNTO THEM UNTIL THEY SEE  FOR THEMSELVES  THE PENALTY GRIEVOUS 
   WHY WAS THERE NOT A SINGLE TOWNSHIP  AMONG THOSE WE WARMED  WHICH BELIEVED SO ITS FAITH SHOULD HAVE PROFITED IT EXCEPT THE PEOPLE OF JONAH  WHEN THEY BELIEVED WE REMOVED FROM THEM THE PENALTY OF IGNOMINY IN THE LIFE OF THE PRESENT AND PERMITTED THEM TO ENJOY  THEIR LIFE  FOR A WHILE 
   IF IT HAD BEEN THE LORD S WILL THEY WOULD ALL HAVE BELIEVED ALL WHO ARE ON EARTH  WILT THOU THEN COMPEL MANKIND AGAINST THEIR WILL TO BELIEVE 
   NO SOUL CAN BELIEVE EXCEPT BY THE WILL OF GOD AND HE WILL PLACE DOUBT  OR OBSCURITY  ON THOSE WHO WILL NOT UNDERSTAND 
   SAY   BEHOLD ALL THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   BUT NEITHER SIGNS NOR WARNERS PROFIT THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT 
   DO THEY THEN EXPECT  ANYTHING  BUT  WHAT HAPPENED IN  THE DAYS OF THE MEN WHO PASSED AWAY BEFORE THEM  SAY   WAIT YE THEN  FOR I TOO WILL WAIT WITH YOU  
   IN THE END WE DELIVER OUR APOSTLES AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE  THUS IS IT FITTING ON OUR PART THAT WE SHOULD DELIVER THOSE WHO BELIEVE SECTION  
   SAY   O YE MEN  IF YE ARE IN DOUBT AS TO MY RELIGION  BEHOLD   I WORSHIP NOT WHAT YE WORSHIP OTHER THAN GOD BUT I WORSHIP GOD WHO WILL TAKE YOUR SOULS  AT DEATH   I AM COMMANDED TO BE  IN THE RANKS  OF THE BELIEVERS 
    AND FURTHER  THUS    SET THY FACE TOWARDS RELIGION WITH TRUE PIETY AND NEVER IN ANYWISE BE OF THE UNBELIEVERS 
    NOR CALL ON ANY OTHER THAN GOD SUCH WILL NEITHER PROFIT THEE NOR HURT THEE  IF THOU DOST BEHOLD  THOU SHALT CERTAINLY BE OF THOSE WHO DO WRONG  
   IF GOD DO TOUCH THEE WITH HURT THERE IS NONE CAN REMOVE IT BUT HE  IF HE DO DESIGN SOME BENEFIT FOR THEE THERE IS NONE CAN KEEP BACK HIS FAVOR  HE CAUSETH IT TO REACH WHOMSOEVER OF HIS SERVANTS HE PLEASETH  AND HE IS THE OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   SAY   O YE MEN  NOW TRUTH HATH REACHED YOU FROM YOUR LORD  THOSE WHO RECEIVE GUIDANCE DO SO FOR THE GOOD OF THEIR OWN SOULS  THOSE WHO STRAY DO SO TO THEIR OWN LOSS  AND I AM NOT  SET  OVER YOU TO ARRANGE YOUR AFFAIRS  
   FOLLOW THOU THE INSPIRATION SENT UNTO THEE AND BE PATIENT AND CONSTANT TILL GOD DOTH DECIDE  FOR HE IS THE BEST TO DECIDE 
   A  L  R   THIS IS  A BOOK  WITH VERSES BASIC OR FUNDAMENTAL  OF ESTABLISHED MEANING   FURTHER EXPLAINED IN DETAIL   FROM ONE WHO IS WISE AND WELL ACQUAINTED  WITH ALL THINGS   
    IT TEACHETH  THAT YE SHOULD WORSHIP NONE BUT GOD   SAY &COLON     VERILY I AM  SENT  UNTO YOU FROM HIM TO WARN AND TO BRING GLAD TIDINGS  
      AND TO PREACH THUS     SEEK YE THE FORGIVENESS OF YOUR LORD  AND TURN TO HIM IN REPENTANCE   THAT HE MAY GRANT YOU ENJOYMENT  GOOD  AND TRUE   FOR A TERM APPOINTED  AND BESTOW HIS ABOUNDING GRACE ON ALL WHO ABOUND IN MERIT   BUT IF YE TURN AWAY  THEN I FEAR FOR YOU THE PENALTY OF A GREAT DAY  
       TO GOD IS YOUR RETURN  AND HE HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS    
   BEHOLD   THEY FOLD UP THEIR HEARTS  THAT THEY MAY LIE HID FROM HIM   AH   EVEN WHEN THEY COVER THEMSELVES WITH THEIR GARMENTS  HE KNOWETH WHAT THEY CONCEAL  AND WHAT THEY REVEAL   FOR HE KNOWETH WELL THE  INMOST SECRETS  OF THE HEARTS 
   THERE IS NO MOVING CREATURE ON EARTH BUT ITS SUSTENANCE DEPENDETH ON GOD   HE KNOWETH THE TIME AND PLACE OF ITS DEFINITE ABODE AND ITS TEMPORARY DEPOSIT   ALL IS IN A CLEAR RECORD 
   HE IT IS WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH IN SIX DAYS AND HIS THRONE WAS OVER THE WATERS  THAT HE MIGHT TRY YOU  WHICH OF YOU IS BEST IN CONDUCT  BUT IF THOU WERT TO SAY TO THEM    YE SHALL INDEED BE RAISED UP AFTER DEATH    THE UNBELIEVERS WOULD BE SURE TO SAY    THIS IS NOTHING BUT OBVIOUS SORCERY    
   IF WE DELAY THE PENALTY FOR THEM FOR A DEFINITE TERM  THEY ARE SURE TO SAY    WHAT KEEPS IT BACK     AH   ON THE DAY IT  ACTUALLY  REACHES THEM  NOTHING WILL TURN IT AWAY FROM THEM  AND THEY WILL BE COMPLETELY ENCIRCLED BY THAT WHICH THEY USED TO MOCK AT  SECTION  
   IF WE GIVE MAN A TASTE OF MERCY FROM OURSELVES  AND THEN WITHDRAW IT FROM HIM  BEHOLD   HE IS IN DESPAIR AND  FALLS INTO  BLASPHEMY 
   BUT IF WE GIVE HIM A TASTE OF  OUR  FAVOURS AFTER ADVERSITY HATH TOUCHED HIM  HE IS SURE TO SAY    ALL EVIL HAS DEPARTED FROM ME     BEHOLD   HE FALLS INTO EXULTATION AND PRIDE 
   NOT SO DO THOSE WHO SHOW PATIENCE AND CONSTANCY  AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS   FOR THEM IS FORGIVENESS  OF SINS  AND A GREAT REWARD 
   PERCHANCE THOU MAYEST  FEEL THE INCLINATION  TO GIVE UP A PART OF WHAT IS REVEALED UNTO THEE  AND THY HEART FEELETH STRAITENED LEST THEY SAY    WHY IS NOT A TREASURE SENT DOWN UNTO HIM  OR WHY DOES NOT AN ANGEL COME DOWN WITH HIM     BUT THOU ART THERE ONLY TO WARN   IT IS GOD THAT ARRANGETH ALL AFFAIRS  
   OR THEY MAY SAY    HE FORGED IT   SAY    BRING YE THEN TEN SŪRAS FORGED  LIKE UNTO IT  AND CALL  TO YOUR AID  WHOMSOEVER YE CAN  OTHER THAN GOD    IF YE SPEAK THE TRUTH  
     IF THEN THEY  YOUR FALSE GODS  ANSWER NOT YOUR  CALL   KNOW YE THAT THIS REVELATION IS SENT DOWN  REPLETE  WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD  AND THAT THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE   WILL YE EVEN THEN SUBMIT  TO ISLAM     
   THOSE WHO DESIRE THE LIFE OF THE PRESENT AND ITS GLITTER  TO THEM WE SHALL PAY  THE PRICE OF  THEIR DEEDS THEREIN   WITHOUT DIMINUTION 
   THEY ARE THOSE FOR WHOM THERE IS NOTHING IN THE HEREAFTER BUT THE FIRE   VAIN ARE THE DESIGNS THEY FRAME THEREIN  AND OF NO EFFECT ARE THE DEEDS THAT THEY DO  
   CAN THEY BE  LIKE  THOSE WHO ACCEPT A CLEAR  SIGN  FROM THEIR LORD  AND WHOM A WITNESS FROM HIMSELF DOTH TEACH  AS DID THE BOOK OF MOSES BEFORE IT  A GUIDE AND A MERCY   THEY BELIEVE THEREIN   BUT THOSE OF THE SECTS THAT REJECT IT  THE FIRE WILL BE THEIR PROMISED MEETING PLACE  BE NOT THEN IN DOUBT THEREON   FOR IT IS THE TRUTH FROM THY LORD   YET MANY AMONG MEN DO NOT BELIEVE  
   WHO DOTH MORE WRONG THAN THOSE WHO INVENT A LIE AGAINST GOD   THEY WILL BE TURNED BACK TO THE PRESENCE OF THEIR LORD  AND THE WITNESSES WILL SAY    THESE ARE THE ONES WHO LIED AGAINST THEIR LORD   BEHOLD   THE CURSE OF GOD IS ON THOSE WHO DO WRONG   
     THOSE WHO WOULD HINDER  MEN  FROM THE PATH OF GOD AND WOULD SEEK IN IT SOMETHING CROOKED   THESE WERE THEY WHO DENIED THE HEREAFTER  
   THEY WILL IN NO WISE FRUSTRATE  HIS DESIGN  ON EARTH  NOR HAVE THEY PROTECTORS BESIDES GOD   THEIR PENALTY WILL BE DOUBLED   THEY LOST THE POWER TO HEAR  AND THEY DID NOT SEE  
   THEY ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE LOST THEIR OWN SOULS   AND THE  FANCIES  THEY INVENTED HAVE LEFT THEM IN THE LURCH  
   WITHOUT A DOUBT  THESE ARE THE VERY ONES WHO WILL LOSE MOST IN THE HEREAFTER  
   BUT THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS  AND HUMBLE THEMSELVES BEFORE THEIR LORD   THEY WILL BE COMPANIONS OF THE GARDEN  TO DWELL THEREIN FOR AYE  
   THESE TWO KINDS  OF MEN  MAY BE COMPARED TO THE BLIND AND DEAF  AND THOSE WHO CAN SEE AND HEAR WELL  ARE THEY EQUAL WHEN COMPARED   WILL YE NOT THEN TAKE HEED  SECTION  
   WE SENT NOAH TO HIS PEOPLE  WITH A MISSION      I HAVE COME TO YOU WITH A CLEAR WARNING  
     THAT YE SERVE NONE BUT GOD   VERILY I DO FEAR FOR YOU THE PENALTY OF A GRIEVOUS DAY  
   BUT THE CHIEFS OF THE UNBELIEVERS AMONG HIS PEOPLE SAID     WE SEE  IN  THEE NOTHING BUT A MAN LIKE OURSELVES   NOR DO WE SEE THAT ANY FOLLOW THEE BUT THE MEANEST AMONG US  IN JUDGMENT IMMATURE   NOR DO WE SEE IN YOU  ALL  ANY MERIT ABOVE US   IN FACT WE THINK YE ARE LIARS    
   HE SAID     O MY PEOPLE   SEE YE IF  IT BE THAT  I HAVE A CLEAR SIGN FROM MY LORD  AND THAT HE HATH SENT MERCY UNTO ME FROM HIS OWN PRESENCE  BUT THAT THE MERCY HATH BEEN OBSCURED FROM YOUR SIGHT   SHALL WE COMPEL YOU TO ACCEPT IT WHEN YE ARE AVERSE TO IT  
     AND O MY PEOPLE   I ASK YOU FOR NO WEALTH IN RETURN   MY REWARD IS FROM NONE BUT GOD   BUT I WILL NOT DRIVE AWAY  IN CONTEMPT  THOSE WHO BELIEVE   FOR VERILY THEY ARE TO MEET THEIR LORD  AND YE I SEE ARE THE IGNORANT ONES  
     AND O MY PEOPLE   WHO WOULD HELP ME AGAINST GOD IF I DROVE THEM AWAY   WILL YE NOT THEN TAKE HEED  
     I TELL YOU NOT THAT WITH ME ARE THE TREASURES OF GOD  NOR DO I KNOW WHAT IS HIDDEN  NOR CLAIM I TO BE AN ANGEL  NOR YET DO I SAY  OF THOSE WHOM YOUR EYES DO DESPISE THAT GOD WILL NOT GRANT THEM  ALL  THAT IS GOOD   GOD KNOWETH BEST WHAT IS IN THEIR SOULS  I SHOULD  IF I DID  INDEED BE A WRONG DOER  
   THEY SAID     O NOAH   THOU HAST DISPUTED WITH US  AND  MUCH  HAST THOU PROLONGED THE DISPUTE WITH US   NOW BRING UPON US WHAT THOU THREATENEST US WITH  IF THOU SPEAKEST THE TRUTH     
   HE SAID     TRULY  GOD WILL BRING IT ON YOU IF HE WILLS  AND THEN  YE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FRUSTRATE IT  
     OF NO PROFIT WILL BE MY COUNSEL TO YOU  MUCH AS I DESIRE TO GIVE YOU  GOOD  COUNSEL  IF IT BE THAT GOD WILLETH TO LEAVE YOU ASTRAY   HE IS YOUR LORD   AND TO HIM WILL YE RETURN    
   OR DO THEY SAY    HE HAS FORGED IT    SAY     IF I HAD FORGED IT  ON ME WERE MY SIN   AND I AM FREE OF THE SINS OF WHICH YE ARE GUILTY  SECTION  
   IT WAS REVEALED TO NOAH     NONE OF THY PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE EXCEPT THOSE WHO HAVE BELIEVED ALREADY   SO GRIEVE NO LONGER OVER THEIR  EVIL  DEEDS 
     BUT CONSTRUCT AN ARK UNDER OUR EYES AND OUR INSPIRATION  AND ADDRESS ME NO  FURTHER  ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO ARE IN SIN   FOR THEY ARE ABOUT TO BE OVERWHELMED  IN THE FLOOD   
   FORTHWITH HE  STARTS  CONSTRUCTING THE ARK   EVERY TIME THAT THE CHIEFS OF HIS PEOPLE PASSED BY HIM  THEY THREW RIDICULE ON HIM  THEY THREW RIDICULE ON HIM  HE SAID     IF YE RIDICULE US NOW  WE  IN OUR TURN  CAN LOOK DOWN ON YOU WITH RIDICULE LIKEWISE  
     BUT SOON WILL YE KNOW WHO IT IS ON WHOM WILL DESCEND A PENALTY THAT WILL COVER THEM WITH SHAME  ON WHOM WILL BE UNLOOSED A PENALTY LASTING    
   AT LENGTH  BEHOLD   THERE CAME OUR COMMAND  AND THE FOUNTAINS OF THE EARTH GUSHED FORTH   WE SAID     EMBARK THEREIN  OF EACH KIND TWO  MALE AND FEMALE  AND YOUR FAMILY EXCEPT THOSE AGAINST WHOM THE WORD HAS ALREADY GONE FORTH   AND THE BELIEVERS   BUT ONLY A FEW BELIEVED WITH HIM 
   SO HE SAID     EMBARK YE ON THE ARK  IN THE NAME OF GOD  WHETHER IT MOVE OR BE AT REST   FOR MY LORD IS  BE SURE  OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL    
   SO THE ARK FLOATED WITH THEM ON THE WAVES  TOWERING  LIKE MOUNTAINS  AND NOAH CALLED OUT TO HIS SON  WHO HAD SEPARATED HIMSELF  FROM THE REST      O MY SON   EMBARK WITH US  AND BE NOT WITH THE UNBELIEVERS    
   THE SON REPLIED     I WILL BETAKE MYSELF TO SOME MOUNTAIN   IT WILL SAVE ME FROM THE WATER   NOAH SAID     THIS DAY NOTHING CAN SAVE  FROM THE COMMAND OF GOD  ANY BUT THOSE ON WHOM HE HATH MERCY      AND THE WAVES CAME BETWEEN THEM  AND THE SON WAS AMONG THOSE OVERWHELMED IN THE FLOOD 
   THEN WHEN THE WORD WENT FORTH     O EARTH   SWALLOW UP THY WATER  AND O SKY   WITHHOLD  THY RAIN      AND THE WATER ABATED  AND THE MATTER WAS ENDED  THE ARK RESTED ON MOUNT JŪDĪ  AND THE WORD WENT FORTH     AWAY WITH THOSE WHO DO WRONG    
   AND NOAH CALLED UPON HIS LORD  AND SAID     O MY LORD   SURELY MY SON IS OF MY FAMILY   AND THY PROMISE IS TRUE  AND THOU ART THE JUSTEST OF JUDGES    
   HE SAID     O NOAH   HE IS NOT OF THY FAMILY   FOR HIS CONDUCT IS UNRIGHTEOUS  SO ASK NOT OF ME THAT OF WHICH THOU HAST NO KNOWLEDGE   I GIVE THEE COUNSEL  LEST THOU ACT LIKE THE IGNORANT    
   NOAH SAID     O MY LORD   I DO SEEK REFUGE WITH THEE  LEST I ASK THEE FOR THAT OF WHICH I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE  AND UNLESS THOU FORGIVE ME AND HAVE MERCY ON ME  I SHOULD INDEED BE LOST    
   THE WORD CAME     O NOAH   COME DOWN  FROM THE ARK  WITH PEACE FROM US  AND BLESSING ON THEE AND ON SOME OF THE PEOPLES  WHO WILL SPRING  FROM THOSE WITH THEE   BUT  THERE WILL BE OTHER  PEOPLES TO WHOM WE SHALL GRANT THEIR PLEASURES  FOR A TIME   BUT IN THE END WILL A GRIEVOUS PENALTY REACH THEM FROM US  
   SUCH ARE SOME OF THE STORIES OF THE UNSEEN  WHICH WE HAVE REVEALED UNTO THEE   BEFORE THIS  NEITHER THOU NOR THY PEOPLE KNEW THEM  SO PERSEVERE PATIENTLY   FOR THE END IS FOR THOSE WHO ARE RIGHTEOUS SECTION  
   TO THE  ĀD PEOPLE  WE SENT  HŪD  ONE OF THEIR OWN BRETHREN  HE SAID     O MY PEOPLE   WORSHIP GOD   YE HAVE NO OTHER GOD BUT HIM   YOUR OTHER GODS  YE DO NOTHING BUT INVENT  
     O MY PEOPLE   I ASK OF YOU NO REWARD FOR THIS  MESSAGE   MY REWARD IS FROM NONE BUT HIM WHO CREATED ME   WILL YE NOT THEN UNDERSTAND  
     AND O MY PEOPLE   ASK FORGIVENESS OF YOUR LORD  AND TURN TO HIM  IN REPENTANCE    HE WILL SEND YOU THE SKIES POURING ABUNDANT RAIN  AND ADD STRENGTH TO YOUR STRENGTH   SO TURN YE NOT BACK IN SIN    
   THEY SAID     O HŪD   NO CLEAR  SIGN  HAST THOU BROUGHT US  AND WE ARE NOT THE ONES TO DESERT OUR GODS ON THY WORD   NOR SHALL WE BELIEVE IN THEE  
     WE SAY NOTHING BUT THAT  PERHAPS  SOME OF OUR GODS MAY HAVE SEIZED THEE WITH IMBECILITY   HE SAID     I CALL GOD TO WITNESS  AND DO YE BEAR WITNESS  THAT I AM FREE FROM THE SIN OF ASCRIBING  TO HIM 
     OTHER GODS AS PARTNERS   SO SCHEME  YOUR WORST  AGAINST ME  ALL OF YOU  AND GIVE ME NO RESPITE 
     I PUT MY TRUST IN GOD  MY LORD AND YOUR LORD   THERE IS NOT A MOVING CREATURE  BUT HE HATH GRASP OF ITS FORE LOCK  VERILY  IT IS MY LORD THAT IS ON A STRAIGHT PATH 
     IF YE TURN AWAY   I  AT LEAST  HAVE CONVEYED THE MESSAGE WITH WHICH I WAS SENT TO YOU  MY LORD WILL MAKE ANOTHER PEOPLE TO SUCCEED YOU  AND YOU WILL NOT HARM HIM IN THE LEAST  FOR MY LORD HATH CARE AND WATCH OVER ALL THINGS  
   SO WHEN OUR DECREE ISSUED  WE SAVED HŪD AND THOSE WHO BELIEVED WITH HIM  BY  SPECIAL  GRACE FROM OURSELVES   WE SAVED THEM FROM A SEVERE PENALTY 
   SUCH WERE THE  ĀD PEOPLE   THEY REJECTED THE SIGNS OF THEIR LORD AND CHERISHER   DISOBEYED HIS APOSTLES   AND FOLLOWED THE COMMAND OF EVERY POWERFUL  OBSTINATE TRANSGRESSOR 
   AND THEY WERE PURSUED BY A CURSE IN THIS LIFE   AND ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  AH   BEHOLD   FOR THE  ĀD REJECTED THEIR LORD AND CHERISHER   AH   BEHOLD   REMOVED  FROM SIGHT  WERE  ĀD THE PEOPLE OF HŪD  SECTION  
   TO THE THAMŪD PEOPLE  WE SENT  ṢĀLIḤ  ONE OF THEIR OWN BRETHREN  HE SAID     O MY PEOPLE   WORSHIP GOD   YE HAVE NO OTHER GOD BUT HIM  IT IS HE WHO HATH PRODUCED YOU FROM THE EARTH AND SETTLED YOU THEREIN   THEN ASK FORGIVENESS OF HIM  AND TURN TO HIM  IN REPENTANCE    FOR MY LORD IS  ALWAYS  NEAR  READY TO ANSWER  
   THEY SAID     O ṢĀLIḤ   THOU HAST BEEN OF US    A CENTER OF OUR HOPES HITHERTO   DOST THOU  NOW  FORBID US THE WORSHIP OF WHAT OUR FATHERS WORSHIPPED   BUT WE ARE REALLY IN SUSPICIOUS  DISQUIETING  DOUBT AS TO THAT TO WHICH THOU INVITEST US  
   HE SAID     O MY PEOPLE   DO YE SEE   IF I HAVE A CLEAR  SIGN  FROM MY LORD AND HE HATH SENT MERCY UNTO ME FROM HIMSELF  WHO THEN CAN HELP ME AGAINST GOD IF I WERE TO DISOBEY HIM   WHAT THEN WOULD YE ADD TO MY  PORTION  BUT PERDITION  
     AND O MY PEOPLE   THIS SHE CAMEL OF GOD IS A SYMBOL TO YOU   LEAVE HER TO FEED ON GOD S  FREE  EARTH  AND INFLICT NO HARM ON HER  OR A SWIFT PENALTY WILL SEIZE YOU    
   BUT THEY DID HAM STRING HER  SO HE SAID     ENJOY YOURSELVES IN YOUR HOMES FOR THREE DAYS    THEN WILL BE YOUR RUIN     BEHOLD  THERE A PROMISE NOT TO BE BELIED    
   WHEN OUR DECREE ISSUED  WE SAVED ṢĀLIḤ AND THOSE WHO BELIEVED WITH HIM  BY  SPECIAL  GRACE FROM OURSELVES  AND FROM THE IGNOMINY OF THAT DAY  FOR THY LORD  HE IS THE STRONG ONE  AND ABLE TO ENFORCE HIS WILL 
   THE  MIGHTY  BLAST OVERTOOK THE WRONG DOERS  AND THEY LAY PROSTRATE IN THEIR HOMES BEFORE THE MORNING  
   AS IF THEY HAD NEVER DWELT AND FLOURISHED THERE  AH   BEHOLD   FOR THE THAMŪD REJECTED THEIR LORD AND CHERISHER   AH   BEHOLD   REMOVED  FROM SIGHT  WERE THE THAMŪD  SECTION  
   THERE CAME OUR MESSENGERS TO ABRAHAM WITH GLAD TIDINGS  THEY SAID    PEACE     HE ANSWERED    PEACE     AND HASTENED TO ENTERTAIN THEM WITH A ROASTED CALF 
   BUT WHEN HE SAW THEIR HANDS WENT NOT TOWARDS THE  MEAL   HE FELT SOME MISTRUST OF THEM  AND CONCEIVED A FEAR OF THEM  THEY SAID     FEAR NOT   WE HAVE BEEN SENT AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF LŪṬ  
   AND HIS WIFE WAS STANDING  THERE   AND SHE LAUGHED   BUT WE GAVE HER GLAD TIDINGS OF ISAAC  AND AFTER HIM  OF JACOB 
   SHE SAID     ALAS FOR ME   SHALL I BEAR A CHILD  SEEING I AM AN OLD WOMAN  AND MY HUSBAND HERE IS AN OLD MAN   THAT WOULD INDEED BE A WONDERFUL THING    
   THEY SAID     DOST THOU WONDER AT GOD S DECREE   THE GRACE OF GOD AND HIS BLESSINGS ON YOU  O YE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE   FOR HE IS INDEED WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE  FULL OF ALL GLORY    
   WHEN FEAR HAD PASSED FROM  THE MIND OF  ABRAHAM AND THE GLAD TIDINGS HAD REACHED HIM  HE BEGAN TO PLEAD WITH US FOR LŪṬ S PEOPLE 
   FOR ABRAHAM WAS  WITHOUT DOUBT  FORBEARING  OF FAULTS   COMPASSIONATE  AND GIVEN TO LOOK TO GOD 
   O ABRAHAM   SEEK NOT THIS  THE DECREE OF THY LORD HATH GONE FORTH   FOR THEM THERE COMETH A PENALTY THAT CANNOT BE TURNED BACK  
   WHEN OUR MESSENGERS CAME TO LŪṬ  HE WAS GRIEVED ON THEIR ACCOUNT AND FELT HIMSELF POWERLESS  TO PROTECT  THEM  HE SAID     THIS IS A DISTRESSFUL DAY  
   AND HIS PEOPLE CAME RUSHING TOWARDS HIM  AND THEY HAD BEEN LONG IN THE HABIT OF PRACTICING ABOMINATIONS  HE SAID     O MY PEOPLE   HERE ARE MY DAUGHTERS   THEY ARE PURER FOR YOU  IF YE MARRY    NOW FEAR GOD  AND COVER ME NOT WITH SHAME ABOUT MY GUESTS   IS THERE NOT AMONG YOU A SINGLE RIGHT MINDED MAN    
   THEY SAID     WELL DOST THOU KNOW WE HAVE NO NEED OF THY DAUGHTERS   INDEED THOU KNOWEST QUITE WELL WHAT WE WANT    
   HE SAID     WOULD THAT I HAD POWER TO SUPPRESS YOU OR THAT I COULD BETAKE MYSELF TO SOME POWERFUL SUPPORT  
    THE MESSENGERS  SAID     O LŪṬ   WE ARE MESSENGERS FROM THY LORD   BY NO MEANS SHALL THEY REACH THEE   NOW TRAVEL WITH THY FAMILY WHILE YET A PART OF THE NIGHT REMAINS  AND LET NOT ANY OF YOU LOOK BACK   BUT THY WIFE  WILL REMAIN BEHIND    TO HER WILL HAPPEN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE  MORNING IS THEIR TIME APPOINTED   IS NOT THE MORNING NIGH    
   WHEN OUR DECREE ISSUED  WE TURNED  THE CITIES  UPSIDE DOWN  AND RAINED DOWN ON THEM BRIMSTONES HARD AS BAKED CLAY  SPREAD  LAYER ON LAYER  
   MARKED AS FROM THY LORD   NOR ARE THEY EVER FAR FROM THOSE WHO DO WRONG  SECTION  
   TO THE MADYAN PEOPLE  WE SENT  SHU AIB  ONE OF THEIR OWN BRETHREN   HE SAID     O MY PEOPLE   WORSHIP GOD   YE HAVE NO OTHER GOD BUT HIM  AND GIVE NOT SHORT MEASURE OR WEIGHT   I SEE YOU IN PROSPERITY  BUT I FEAR FOR YOU THE PENALTY OF A DAY THAT WILL COMPASS  YOU  ALL ROUND 
     AND O MY PEOPLE   GIVE JUST MEASURE AND WEIGHT  NOR WITHHOLD FROM THE PEOPLE THE THINGS THAT ARE THEIR DUE   COMMIT NOT EVIL IN THE LAND WITH INTENT TO DO MISCHIEF 
     THAT WHICH IS LEFT YOU BY GOD IS BEST FOR YOU  IF YE  BUT  BELIEVED   BUT I AM NOT SET OVER YOU TO KEEP WATCH    
   THEY SAID     OH SHU AIB   DOES THY  RELIGION OF  PRAYER COMMAND THEE THAT WE LEAVE OFF THE WORSHIP WHICH OUR FATHERS PRACTISED  OR THAT WE LEAVE OFF DOING WHAT WE LIKE WITH OUR PROPERTY   TRULY  THOUGH ART THE ONE THAT FORBEARETH WITH FAULTS AND IS RIGHT MINDED    
   HE SAID     O MY PEOPLE   SEE YE WHETHER I HAVE A CLEAR  SIGN  FROM MY LORD  AND HE HATH GIVEN ME SUSTENANCE  PURE AND  GOOD AS FROM HIMSELF   I WISH NOT  IN OPPOSITION TO YOU  TO DO THAT WHICH I FORBID YOU TO DO  I ONLY DESIRE  YOUR  BETTERMENT TO THE BEST OF MY POWER   AND MY SUCCESS  IN MY TASK  CAN ONLY COME FROM GOD  IN HIM I TRUST  AND UNTO HIM I LOOK 
     AND O MY PEOPLE   LET NOT MY DISSENT  FROM YOU  CAUSE YOU TO SIN  LEST YE SUFFER A FATE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PEOPLE OF NOAH OR OF HŪD OR OF ṢĀLIḤ  NOR ARE THE PEOPLE OF LŪṬ FAR OFF FROM YOU  
     BUT ASK FORGIVENESS OF YOUR LORD  AND TURN UNTO HIM  IN REPENTANCE    FOR MY LORD IS INDEED FULL OF MERCY AND LOVING KINDNESS  
   THEY SAID     O SHU AIB   MUCH OF WHAT THOU SAYEST WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND   IN FACT AMONG US WE SEE THAT THOU HAST NO STRENGTH   WERE IT NOT FOR THY FAMILY  WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE STONED THEE   FOR THOU HAST AMONG US NO GREAT POSITION    
   HE SAID     O MY PEOPLE   IS THEN MY FAMILY OF MORE CONSIDERATION WITH YOU THAN GOD   FOR YE CAST HIM AWAY BEHIND YOUR BACKS  WITH CONTEMPT   BUT VERILY MY LORD ENCOMPASSETH ON ALL SIDES ALL THAT YE DO  
     AND O MY PEOPLE   DO WHATEVER YE CAN   I WILL DO  MY PART    SOON WILL YE KNOW WHO IT IS ON WHOM DESCENDS THE PENALTY OF IGNOMINY  AND WHO IS A LIAR   AND WATCH YE   FOR I TOO AM WATCHING WITH YOU    
   WHEN OUR DECREE ISSUED  WE SAVED SHU AIB AND THOSE WHO BELIEVED WITH HIM  BY  SPECIAL  MERCY FROM OURSELVES   BUT THE  MIGHTY  BLAST DID SEIZE THE WRONG DOERS  AND THEY LAY PROSTRATE IN THEIR HOMES BY THE MORNING  
   AS IF THEY HAD NEVER DWELT AND FLOURISHED THERE   AH   BEHOLD   HOW THE MADYAN WERE REMOVED  FROM SIGHT  AS WERE REMOVED THE THAMŪD  SECTION  
   AND WE SENT MOSES  WITH OUR CLEAR  SIGNS  AND AN AUTHORITY MANIFEST 
   UNTO PHARAOH AND HIS CHIEFS   BUT THEY FOLLOWED THE COMMAND OF PHARAOH  AND THE COMMAND OF PHARAOH WAS NO RIGHT  GUIDE  
   HE WILL GO BEFORE HIS PEOPLE ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  AND LEAD THEM INTO THE FIRE  AS CATTLE ARE LED TO WATER    BUT WOEFUL INDEED WILL BE THE PLACE TO WHICH THEY ARE LED  
   AND THEY ARE FOLLOWED BY A CURSE IN THIS  LIFE  AND ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT   AND WOEFUL IS THE GIFT WHICH SHALL BE GIVEN  UNTO THEM   
   THESE ARE SOME OF THE STORIES OF COMMUNITIES WHICH WE RELATE UNTO THEE   OF THEM SOME ARE STANDING  AND SOME HAVE BEEN MOWN DOWN  BY THE SICKLE OF TIME  
   IT WAS NOT WE THAT WRONGED THEM   THEY WRONGED THEIR OWN SOULS   THE DEITIES  OTHER THAN GOD  WHOM THEY INVOKED  PROFITED THEM NO WHIT WHEN THERE ISSUED THE DECREE OF THY LORD   NOR DID THEY ADD AUGHT  TO THEIR LOT  BUT PERDITION  
   SUCH IS THE CHASTISEMENT OF THY LORD WHEN HE CHASTISES COMMUNITIES IN THE MIDST OF THEIR WRONG   GRIEVOUS  INDEED  AND SEVERE IS HIS CHASTISEMENT 
   IN THAT IS A SIGN FOR THOSE WHO FEAR THE PENALTY OF THE HEREAFTER   THAT IS A DAY FOR WHICH MANKIND WILL BE GATHERED TOGETHER   THAT WILL BE A DAY OF TESTIMONY 
   NOR SHALL WE DELAY IT BUT FOR A TERM APPOINTED 
   THE DAY IT ARRIVES  NO SOUL SHALL SPEAK EXCEPT BY HIS LEAVE   OF THOSE  GATHERED  SOME WILL BE WRETCHED AND SOME WILL BE BLESSED 
   THOSE WHO ARE WRETCHED SHALL BE IN THE FIRE   THERE WILL BE FOR THEM THEREIN  NOTHING BUT  THE HEAVING OF SIGHS AND SOBS  
   THEY WILL DWELL THEREIN FOR ALL THE TIME THAT THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH ENDURE  EXCEPT AS THY LORD WILLETH   FOR THY LORD IS THE  SURE  ACCOMPLISHER OF WHAT HE PLANNETH 
   AND THOSE WHO ARE BLESSED SHALL BE IN THE GARDEN   THEY WILL DWELL THEREIN FOR ALL THE TIME THAT THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH ENDURE  EXCEPT AS THY LORD WILLETH   A GIFT WITHOUT BREAK 
   BE NOT THEN IN DOUBT AS TO WHAT THESE MEN WORSHIP  THEY WORSHIP NOTHING BUT WHAT THEIR FATHERS WORSHIPPED BEFORE  THEM    BUT VERILY WE SHALL PAY THEM BACK  IN FULL  THEIR PORTION WITHOUT  THE LEAST  ABATEMENT SECTION  
   WE CERTAINLY GAVE THE BOOK TO MOSES  BUT DIFFERENCES AROSE THEREIN   HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT A WORD HAD GONE FORTH BEFORE FROM THY LORD  THE MATTER WOULD HAVE BEEN DECIDED BETWEEN THEM   BUT THEY ARE IN SUSPICIOUS DOUBT CONCERNING IT 
   AND OF A SURETY  TO ALL WILL YOUR LORD PAY BACK  IN FULL THE RECOMPENSE  OF THEIR DEEDS   FOR HE KNOWETH WELL ALL THAT THEY DO 
   THEREFORE STAND FIRM  IN THE STRAIGHT PATH  AS THOU ART COMMANDED   THOU AND THOSE WHO WITH THEE TURN  UNTO GOD    AND TRANSGRESS NOT  FROM THE PATH    FOR HE SEETH WELL ALL THAT YE DO 
   AND INCLINE NOT TO THOSE WHO DO WRONG  OR THE FIRE WILL SEIZE YOU   AND YE HAVE NO PROTECTORS OTHER THAN GOD  NOR SHALL YE BE HELPED 
   AND ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS AT THE TWO ENDS OF THE DAY AND AT THE APPROACHES OF THE NIGHT   FOR THOSE THINGS THAT ARE GOOD REMOVE THOSE THAT ARE EVIL   BE THAT THE WORD OF REMEMBRANCE TO THOSE WHO REMEMBER  THEIR LORD   
   AND BE STEADFAST IN PATIENCE   FOR VERILY GOD WILL NOT SUFFER THE REWARD OF THE RIGHTEOUS TO PERISH 
   WHY WERE THERE NOT  AMONG THE GENERATIONS BEFORE YOU  PERSONS POSSESSED OF BALANCED GOOD SENSE  PROHIBITING  MEN  FROM MISCHIEF IN THE EARTH  EXCEPT A FEW AMONG THEM WHOM WE SAVED  FROM HARM    BUT THE WRONG DOERS PURSUED THE ENJOYMENT OF THE GOOD THINGS OF LIFE WHICH WERE GIVEN THEM  AND PERSISTED IN SIN 
   NOR WOULD THY LORD BE THE ONE TO DESTROY COMMUNITIES FOR A SINGLE WRONG DOING  IF ITS MEMBERS WERE LIKELY TO MEND 
   IF THY LORD HAD SO WILLED  HE COULD HAVE MADE MANKIND ONE PEOPLE   BUT THEY WILL NOT CEASE TO DISPUTE 
   EXCEPT THOSE ON WHOM THY LORD HATH BESTOWED HIS MERCY   AND FOR THIS DID HE CREATE THEM   AND THE WORD OF THY LORD SHALL BE FULFILLED     I WILL FILL HELL WITH JINNS AND MEN ALL TOGETHER  
   ALL THAT WE RELATE TO THEE OF THE STORIES OF THE APOSTLES   WITH IT WE MAKE FIRM THY HEART   IN THEM THERE COMETH TO THEE THE TRUTH  AS WELL AS AN EXHORTATION AND A MESSAGE OF REMEMBRANCE TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE

     THUS WILL THY LORD CHOOSE THEE AND TEACH THEE THE INTERPRETATION OF STORIES  AND EVENTS  AND PERFECT HIS FAVOUR TO THEE AND TO THE POSTERITY OF JACOB EVEN AS HE PERFECTED IT TO THY FATHERS ABRAHAM AND ISAAC AFORETIME   FOR GOD IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM  SECTION

   THEY SAID     TRULY JOSEPH AND HIS BROTHER ARE LOVED MORE BY OUR FATHER THAN WE   BUT WE ARE A GOODLY BODY   REALLY OUR FATHER IS OBVIOUSLY WANDERING  IN HIS MIND   
     SLAY YE JOSEPH OR CAST HIM OUT TO SOME  UNKNOWN  LAND  THAT SO THE FAVOUR OF YOUR FATHER MAY BE GIVEN TO YOU ALONE    THERE WILL BE TIME ENOUGH  FOR YOU TO BE RIGHTEOUS AFTER THAT    
   SAID ONE OF THEM     SLAY NOT JOSEPH BUT IF YE MUST DO SOMETHING  THROW HIM DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL   HE WILL BE PICKED UP BY SOME CARAVAN OF TRAVELLERS  
   THEY SAID     O OUR FATHER   WHY DOST THOU NOT TRUST US WITH JOSEPH  SEEING WE ARE INDEED HIS SINCERE WELL WISHERS  
     SEND HIM WITH US TO MORROW TO ENJOY HIMSELF AND PLAY  AND WE SHALL TAKE EVERY CARE OF HIM  
    JACOB  SAID     REALLY IT SADDENS ME THAT YE SHOULD TAKE HIM AWAY   I FEAR LEST THE WOLF SHOULD DEVOUR HIM WHILE YE ATTEND NOT TO HIM  
   THEY SAID     IF THE WOLF WERE TO DEVOUR HIM WHILE WE ARE  SO LARGE  A PARTY  THEN SHOULD WE INDEED  FIRST  HAVE PERISHED OURSELVES    
   SO THEY DID TAKE HIM AWAY  AND THEY ALL AGREED TO THROW HIM DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL   AND WE PUT INTO HIS HEART  THIS MESSAGE      OF A SURETY THOU SHALT  ONE DAY  TELL THEM THE TRUTH OF THIS THEIR AFFAIR WHILE THEY KNOW  THEE  NOT  
   THEN THEY CAME TO THEIR FATHER IN THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT  WEEPING 
   THEY SAID     OH OUR FATHER   WE WENT RACING WITH ONE ANOTHER  AND LEFT JOSEPH WITH OUR THINGS   AND THE WOLF DEVOURED HIM  BUT THOU WILT NEVER BELIEVE US EVEN THOUGH WE TELL THE TRUTH  
   THEY STAINED HIS SHIRT WITH FALSE BLOOD  HE SAID     NAY  BUT YOUR MINDS HAVE MADE UP A TALE  THAT MAY PASS  WITH YOU   FOR ME  PATIENCE IS MOST FITTING   AGAINST THAT WHICH YE ASSERT  IT IS GOD  ALONE  WHOSE HELP CAN BE SOUGHT   
   THEN THERE CAME A CARAVAN OF TRAVELLERS   THEY SENT THEIR WATER CARRIER  FOR WATER   AND HE LET DOWN HIS BUCKET  INTO THE WELL  HE SAID     AH THERE   GOOD NEWS   HERE IS A  FINE  YOUNG MAN     SO THEY CONCEALED HIM AS A TREASURE   BUT GOD KNOWETH WELL ALL THAT THEY DO  
   THE  BRETHREN  SOLD HIM FOR A MISERABLE PRICE   FOR A FEW DIRHAMS COUNTED OUT   IN SUCH LOW ESTIMATION DID THEY HOLD HIM  SECTION  
   THE MAN IN EGYPT WHO BOUGHT HIM  SAID TO HIS WIFE     MAKE HIS STAY  AMONG US  HONORABLE   MAYBE HE WILL BRING US MUCH GOOD  OR WE SHALL ADOPT HIM AS A SON   THUS DID WE ESTABLISH JOSEPH IN THE LAND  THAT WE MIGHT TEACH HIM THE INTERPRETATION OF STORIES  AND EVENTS   AND GOD HATH FULL POWER AND CONTROL OVER HIS AFFAIRS   BUT MOST AMONG MANKIND KNOW IT NOT 
   WHEN JOSEPH ATTAINED HIS FULL MANHOOD  WE GAVE HIM POWER AND KNOWLEDGE   THUS DO WE REWARD THOSE WHO DO RIGHT 
   BUT SHE IN WHOSE HOUSE HE WAS  SOUGHT TO SEDUCE HIM FROM HIS  TRUE  SELF   SHE FASTENED THE DOORS  AND SAID     NOW COME  THOU  DEAR ONE      HE SAID     GOD FORBID   TRULY  THY HUSBAND  IS MY LORD   HE MADE MY SOJOURN AGREEABLE   TRULY TO NO GOOD COME THOSE WHO DO WRONG    
   AND  WITH PASSION  DID SHE DESIRE HIM  AND HE WOULD HAVE DESIRED HER  BUT THAT HE SAW THE EVIDENCE OF HIS LORD   THUS  DID WE ORDER  THAT WE MIGHT TURN AWAY FROM HIM  ALL  EVIL AND SHAMEFUL DEEDS   FOR HE WAS ONE OF OUR SERVANTS  SINCERE AND PURIFIED 
   SO THEY BOTH RACED EACH OTHER TO THE DOOR AND SHE TORE HIS SHIRT FROM THE BACK   THEY BOTH FOUND HER LORD NEAR THE DOOR  SHE SAID     WHAT IS THE  FITTING  PUNISHMENT FOR ONE WHO FORMED AN EVIL DESIGN AGAINST THY WIFE  BUT PRISON OR A GRIEVOUS CHASTISEMENT    
   HE SAID     IT WAS SHE THAT SOUGHT TO SEDUCE ME  FROM MY  TRUE  SELF   AND ONE OF HER HOUSEHOLD SAW  THIS  AND BORE WITNESS   THUS       IF IT BE THAT HIS SHIRT IS RENT FORM THE FRONT  THEN IS HER TALE TRUE  AND HE IS A LIAR  
     BUT IF IT BE THAT HIS SHIRT IS TORN FROM THE BACK  THEN IS SHE THE LIAR  AND HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH    
   SO WHEN HE SAW HIS SHIRT   THAT IT WAS TORN AT THE BACK    HER HUSBAND  SAID     BEHOLD   IT IS A SNARE OF YOU WOMEN   TRULY  MIGHTY IS YOUR SNARE  
     O JOSEPH  PASS THIS OVER    O WIFE   ASK FORGIVENESS FOR THY SIN  FOR TRULY THOU HAST BEEN AT FAULT    SECTION  
   LADIES SAID IN THE CITY     THE WIFE OF THE  GREAT   AZĪZ IS SEEKING TO SEDUCE HER SLAVE FROM HIS  TRUE  SELF   TRULY HATH HE INSPIRED HER WITH VIOLENT LOVE   WE SEE SHE IS EVIDENTLY GOING ASTRAY  
   WHEN SHE HEARD OF THEIR MALICIOUS TALK  SHE SENT FOR THEM AND PREPARED A BANQUET FOR THEM   SHE GAVE EACH OF THEM A KNIFE   AND SHE SAID  TO JOSEPH     COME OUT BEFORE THEM   WHEN THEY SAW HIM  THEY DID EXTOL HIM  AND  IN THEIR AMAZEMENT  CUT THEIR HANDS   THEY SAID    GOD PRESERVE US   NO MORTAL IS THIS   THIS IS NONE OTHER THAN A NOBLE ANGEL    
   SHE SAID     THERE BEFORE YOU IS THE MAN ABOUT WHOM YE DID BLAME ME   I DID SEEK TO SEDUCE HIM FROM HIS  TRUE  SELF BUT HE DID FIRMLY SAVE HIMSELF GUILTLESS    AND NOW  IF HE DOTH NOT MY BIDDING  HE SHALL CERTAINLY BE CAST INTO PRISON  AND  WHAT IS MORE  BE OF THE COMPANY OF THE VILEST    
   HE SAID     O MY LORD   THE PRISON IS MORE TO MY LIKING THAN THAT TO WHICH THEY INVITE ME   UNLESS THOU TURN AWAY THEIR SNARE FROM ME  I SHOULD  IN MY YOUTHFUL FOLLY  FEEL INCLINED TOWARDS THEM AND JOIN THE RANKS OF THE IGNORANT  
   SO HIS LORD HEARKENED TO HIM  IN HIS PRAYER   AND TURNED AWAY FROM HIM THEIR SNARE   VERILY HE HEARETH AND KNOWETH  ALL THINGS  
   THEN IT OCCURRED TO THE MEN  AFTER THEY HAD SEEN THE SIGNS   THAT IT WAS BEST  TO IMPRISON HIM FOR A TIME SECTION  
   NOW WITH HIM THERE CAME INTO THE PRISON TWO YOUNG MEN  SAID ONE OF THEM     I SEE MYSELF  IN A DREAM  PRESSING WINE   SAID THE OTHER     I SEE MYSELF  IN A DREAM  CARRYING BREAD ON MY HEAD  AND BIRDS ARE EATING THEREOF     TELL US    THEY SAID    THE TRUTH AND MEANING THEREOF   FOR WE SEE THOU ART ONE THAT DOTH GOOD  TO ALL   
   HE SAID     BEFORE ANY FOOD COMES  IN DUE COURSE  TO FEED EITHER OF YOU  I WILL SURELY REVEAL TO YOU THE TRUTH AND MEANING OF THIS ERE IT BEFALL YOU   THAT IS PART OF THE  DUTY  WHICH MY LORD HATH TAUGHT ME  I HAVE  I ASSURE YOU  ABANDONED THE WAYS OF A PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE NOT IN GOD AND THAT  EVEN  DENY THE HEREAFTER 
     AND I FOLLOW THE WAYS OF MY FATHERS  ABRAHAM  ISAAC  AND JACOB   AND NEVER COULD WE ATTRIBUTE ANY PARTNERS WHATEVER TO GOD   THAT  COMES  OF THE GRACE OF GOD TO US AND TO MANKIND   YET MOST MEN ARE NOT GRATEFUL 
     O MY TWO COMPANIONS OF THE PRISON    I ASK YOU    ARE MANY LORDS DIFFERING AMONG THEMSELVES BETTER  OR THE ONE GOD  SUPREME AND IRRESISTIBLE  
     IF NOT HIM  YE WORSHIP NOTHING BUT NAMES WHICH YE HAVE NAMED   YE AND YOUR FATHERS   FOR WHICH GOD HATH SENT DOWN NO AUTHORITY   THE COMMAND IS FOR NONE BUT GOD   HE HATH COMMANDED THAT YE WORSHIP NONE BUT HIM   THAT IS THE RIGHT RELIGION  BUT MOST MEN UNDERSTAND NOT 
     O MY TWO COMPANIONS OF THE PRISON   AS TO ONE OF YOU  HE WILL POUR OUT THE WINE FOR HIS LORD TO DRINK   AS FOR THE OTHER  HE WILL HANG FROM THE CROSS  AND THE BIRDS WILL EAT FROM OFF HIS HEAD   SO  HATH BEEN DECREED THAT MATTER WHEREOF YE TWAIN DO ENQUIRE   
   AND OF THE TWO  TO THAT ONE WHOM HE CONSIDERED ABOUT TO BE SAVED  HE SAID     MENTION ME TO THY LORD   BUT SATAN MADE HIM FORGET TO MENTION HIM TO HIS LORD   AND  JOSEPH  LINGERED IN PRISON A FEW  MORE  YEARS SECTION  
   THE KING  OF EGYPT  SAID     I DO SEE  IN A VISION  SEVEN FAT KINE  WHOM SEVEN LEAN ONES DEVOUR  AND SEVEN GREEN EARS OF CORN  AND SEVEN  OTHERS  WITHERED  O YE CHIEFS   EXPOUND TO ME MY VISION IF IT BE THAT YE CAN INTERPRET VISIONS  
   THEY SAID     A CONFUSED MEDLEY OF DREAMS   AND WE ARE NOT SKILLED IN THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS  
   BUT THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN RELEASED  ONE OF THE TWO  WHO HAD BEEN IN PRISON  AND WHO NOW BETHOUGHT HIM AFTER  SO LONG  A SPACE OF TIME  SAID     I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH OF ITS INTERPRETATION   SEND YE ME  THEREFOR   
     O JOSEPH      HE SAID    O MAN OF TRUTH   EXPOUND TO US  THE DREAM  OF SEVEN FAT KINE WHOM SEVEN LEAN ONES DEVOUR  AND OF SEVEN GREEN EARS OF CORN AND  SEVEN  OTHERS WITHERED   THAT I MAY RETURN TO THE PEOPLE  AND THAT THEY MAY UNDERSTAND  
    JOSEPH  SAID     FOR SEVEN YEARS SHALL YE DILIGENTLY SOW AS IS YOUR WONT   AND THE HARVESTS THAT YE REAP  YE SHALL LEAVE THEM IN THE EAR   EXCEPT A LITTLE  OF WHICH YE SHALL EAT 
     THEN WILL COME AFTER THAT  PERIOD  SEVEN DREADFUL  YEARS   WHICH WILL DEVOUR WHAT YE SHALL HAVE LAID BY IN ADVANCE FOR THEM    ALL  EXCEPT A LITTLE WHICH YE SHALL HAVE  SPECIALLY  GUARDED 
     THEN WILL COME AFTER THAT  PERIOD  A YEAR IN WHICH THE PEOPLE WILL HAVE ABUNDANT WATER  AND IN WHICH THEY WILL PRESS  WINE AND OIL   SECTION  
   SO THE KING SAID     BRING YE HIM UNTO ME   BUT WHEN THE MESSENGER CAME TO HIM   JOSEPH  SAID     GO THOU BACK TO THY LORD  AND ASK HIM    WHAT IS THE STATE OF MIND OF THE LADIES WHO CUT THEIR HANDS     FOR MY LORD IS CERTAINLY WELL AWARE OF THEIR SNARE  
    THE KING  SAID  TO THE LADIES      WHAT WAS YOUR AFFAIR WHEN YE DID SEEK TO SEDUCE JOSEPH FROM HIS  TRUE  SELF     THE LADIES SAID     GOD PRESERVE US  NO EVIL KNOW WE AGAINST HIM     SAID THE  AZIZ S WIFE     NOW IS THE TRUTH MANIFEST  TO ALL    IT WAS I WHO SOUGHT TO SEDUCE HIM FROM HIS  TRUE  SELF   HE IS INDEED OF THOSE WHO ARE  EVER  TRUE  AND VIRTUOUS  
     THIS  SAY I   IN ORDER THAT HE MAY KNOW THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN FALSE TO HIM IN HIS ABSENCE  AND THAT GOD WILL NEVER GUIDE THE SNARE OF THE FALSE ONES 
     NOR DO I ABSOLVE MY OWN SELF  OF BLAME    THE  HUMAN SOUL  IS CERTAINLY PRONE TO EVIL  UNLESS MY LORD DO BESTOW HIS MERCY   BUT SURELY MY LORD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL  
   SO THE KING SAID     BRING HIM UNTO ME   I WILL TAKE HIM SPECIALLY TO SERVE ABOUT MY OWN PERSON   THEREFORE WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN TO HIM  HE SAID     BE ASSURED THIS DAY  THOU ART  BEFORE OUR OWN PRESENCE  WITH RANK FIRMLY ESTABLISHED  AND FIDELITY FULLY PROVED    
    JOSEPH  SAID     SET ME OVER THE STORE HOUSES OF THE LAND   I WILL INDEED GUARD THEM  AS ONE THAT KNOWS  THEIR IMPORTANCE   
   THUS DID WE GIVE ESTABLISHED POWER TO JOSEPH IN THE LAND  TO TAKE POSSESSION THEREIN AS  WHEN  OR WHERE HE PLEASED  WE BESTOW OF OUR MERCY ON WHOM WE PLEASE  AND WE SUFFER NOT  TO BE LOST  THE REWARD OF THOSE WHO DO GOOD 
   BUT VERILY THE REWARD OF THE HEREAFTER IS THE BEST  FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE  AND ARE CONSTANT IN RIGHTEOUSNESS SECTION  
   THEN CAME JOSEPH S BRETHREN   THEY ENTERED HIS PRESENCE  AND HE KNEW THEM  BUT THEY KNEW HIM NOT 
   AND WHEN HE HAD FURNISHED THEM FORTH WITH PROVISIONS  SUITABLE  FOR THEM  HE SAID     BRING UNTO ME A BROTHER YE HAVE  OF THE SAME FATHER AS YOURSELVES   BUT A DIFFERENT MOTHER    SEE YE NOT THAT I PAY OUT FULL MEASURE  AND THAT I DO PROVIDE THE BEST HOSPITALITY  
     NOW IF YE BRING HIM NOT TO ME  YE SHALL HAVE NO MEASURE  OF CORN  FROM ME  NOR SHALL BE YE  EVEN  COME NEAR ME  
   THEY SAID     WE SHALL CERTAINLY SEEK TO GET OUR WISH ABOUT HIM FROM HIS FATHER   INDEED WE SHALL DO IT  
   AND  JOSEPH  TOLD HIS SERVANTS TO PUT THEIR STOCK IN TRADE  WITH WHICH THEY HAD BARTERED  INTO THEIR SADDLE BAGS  SO THEY SHOULD KNOW IT ONLY WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THEIR PEOPLE  IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT COME BACK 
   NOW WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THEIR FATHER  THEY SAID     O OUR FATHER   NO MORE MEASURE OF GRAIN SHALL WE GET  UNLESS WE TAKE OUR BROTHER    SO SEND OUR BROTHER WITH US  THAT WE MAY GET OUR MEASURE   AND WE WILL INDEED TAKE EVERY CARE OF HIM  
   HE SAID     SHALL I TRUST YOU WITH HIM WITH ANY RESULT OTHER THAN WHEN I TRUSTED YOU WITH HIS BROTHER AFORETIME   BUT GOD IS THE BEST TO TAKE CARE  OF HIM   AND HE IS THE MOST MERCIFUL OF THOSE WHO SHOW MERCY    
   THEN WHEN THEY OPENED THEIR BAGGAGE  THEY FOUND THEIR STOCK IN TRADE HAD BEEN RETURNED TO THEM  THEY SAID     O OUR FATHER   WHAT  MORE  CAN WE DESIRE   THIS OUR STOCK IN TRADE HAS BEEN RETURNED TO US   SO WE SHALL GET  MORE  FOOD FOR OUR FAMILY   WE SHALL TAKE CARE OF OUR BROTHER   AND ADD  AT THE SAME TIME  A FULL CAMEL S LOAD  OF GRAIN TO OUR PROVISIONS   THIS IS BUT A SMALL QUANTITY  
    JACOB  SAID     NEVER WILL I SEND HIM WITH YOU UNTIL YE SWEAR A SOLEMN OATH TO ME  IN GOD S NAME  THAT YE WILL BE SURE TO BRING HIM BACK TO ME UNLESS YE ARE YOURSELVES HEMMED IN  AND MADE POWERLESS    AND WHEN THEY HAD SWORN THEIR SOLEMN OATH  HE SAID     OVER ALL THAT WE SAY  BE GOD THE WITNESS AND GUARDIAN    
   FURTHER HE SAID     O MY SONS   ENTER NOT ALL BY ONE GATE   ENTER YE BY DIFFERENT GATES  NOT THAT I CAN PROFIT YOU AUGHT AGAINST GOD  WITH MY ADVICE    NONE CAN COMMAND EXCEPT GOD   ON HIM DO I PUT MY TRUST   AND LET ALL THAT TRUST PUT THEIR TRUST ON HIM  
   AND WHEN THEY ENTERED IN THE MANNER THEIR FATHER HAD ENJOINED  IT DID NOT PROFIT THEM IN THE LEAST AGAINST  THE PLAN OF  GOD   IT WAS BUT A NECESSITY OF JACOB S SOUL  WHICH HE DISCHARGED  FOR HE WAS  BY OUR INSTRUCTION  FULL OF KNOWLEDGE  AND EXPERIENCE    BUT MOST MEN KNOW NOT SECTION  
   NOW WHEN THEY CAME INTO JOSEPH S PRESENCE  HE RECEIVED HIS  FULL  BROTHER TO STAY WITH HIM  HE SAID  TO HIM      BEHOLD   I AM THY  OWN  BROTHER   SO GRIEVE NOT AT AUGHT OF THEIR DOINGS  
   AT LENGTH WHEN HE HAD FURNISHED THEM FORTH WITH PROVISIONS  SUITABLE  FOR THEM  HE PUT THE DRINKING CUP INTO HIS BROTHER S SADDLE BAG  THEN SHOUTED OUT A CRIER     O YE  IN  THE CARAVAN   BEHOLD   YE ARE THIEVES  WITHOUT DOUBT    
   THEY SAID  TURNING TOWARDS THEM     WHAT IS IT THAT YE MISS    
   THEY SAID     WE MISS THE GREAT BEAKER OF THE KING   FOR HIM WHO PRODUCES IT  IS  THE REWARD OF  A CAMEL LOAD   I WILL BE BOUND BY IT  
    THE BROTHERS  SAID     BY GOD   WELL YE KNOW THAT WE CAME NOT TO MAKE MISCHIEF IN THE LAND  AND WE ARE NO THIEVES    
    THE EGYPTIANS  SAID     WHAT THEN SHALL BE THE PENALTY OF THIS  IF YE ARE  PROVED  TO HAVE LIED    
   THEY SAID     THE PENALTY SHOULD BE THAT HE IN WHOSE SADDLE BAG IT IS FOUND  SHOULD BE HELD  AS BONDMAN  TO ATONE FOR THE  CRIME   THUS IT IS WE PUNISH THE WRONG DOERS    
   SO HE BEGAN  THE SEARCH  WITH THEIR BAGGAGE  BEFORE  HE CAME TO  THE BAGGAGE OF HIS BROTHER   AT LENGTH HE BROUGHT IT OUT OF HIS BROTHER S BAGGAGE  THUS DID WE PLAN FOR JOSEPH  HE COULD NOT TAKE HIS BROTHER BY THE LAW OF THE KING EXCEPT THAT GOD WILLED IT  SO   WE RAISE TO DEGREES  OF WISDOM  WHOM WE PLEASE   BUT OVER ALL ENDUED WITH KNOWLEDGE IS ONE  THE ALL KNOWING 
   THEY SAID     IF HE STEALS  THERE WAS A BROTHER OF HIS WHO DID STEAL BEFORE  HIM    BUT THESE THINGS DID JOSEPH KEEP LOCKED IN HIS HEART  REVEALING NOT THE SECRETS TO THEM  HE  SIMPLY  SAID  TO HIMSELF      YE ARE THE WORSE SITUATED   AND GOD KNOWETH BEST THE TRUTH OF WHAT YE ASSERT    
   THEY SAID     O EXALTED ONE   BEHOLD   HE HAS A FATHER  AGED AND VENERABLE   WHO WILL GRIEVE FOR HIM    SO TAKE ONE OF US IN HIS PLACE   FOR WE SEE THAT THOU ART  GRACIOUS  IN DOING GOOD  
   HE SAID     GOD FORBID THAT WE TAKE OTHER THAN HIM WITH WHOM WE FOUND OUR PROPERTY   INDEED  IF WE DID SO   WE SHOULD BE ACTING WRONGFULLY  SECTION  
   NOW WHEN THEY SAW NO HOPE OF HIS  YIELDING   THEY HELD A CONFERENCE IN PRIVATE  THE LEADER AMONG THEM SAID     KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR FATHER DID TAKE AN OATH FROM YOU IN GOD S NAME  AND HOW ∫EFORE THIS  YE DID FAIL IN YOUR DUTY WITH JOSEPH   THEREFORE WILL I NOT LEAVE THIS LAND UNTIL MY FATHER PERMITS ME  OR GOD COMMANDS ME   AND HE IS THE BEST TO COMMAND 
     TURN YE BACK TO YOUR FATHER  AND SAY    O OUR FATHER   BEHOLD   THY SON COMMITTED THEFT   WE BEAR WITNESS ONLY TO WHAT WE KNOW  AND WE COULD NOT WELL GUARD AGAINST THE UNSEEN  
      ASK AT THE TOWN WHERE WE HAVE BEEN AND THE CARAVAN IN WHICH WE RETURNED  AND  YOU WILL FIND  WE ARE INDEED TELLING THE TRUTH    
   JACOB SAID     NAY  BUT YE HAVE YOURSELVES CONTRIVED A STORY  GOOD ENOUGH  FOR YOU  SO PATIENCE IS MOST FITTING  FOR ME   MAYBE GOD WILL BRING THEM  BACK  ALL TO ME  IN THE END   FOR HE IS INDEED FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM  
   AND HE TURNED AWAY FROM THEM  AND SAID     HOW GREAT IS MY GRIEF FOR JOSEPH     AND HIS EYES BECAME WHITE WITH SORROW  AND HE FELL INTO SILENT MELANCHOLY 
   THEY SAID     BY GOD    NEVER  WILT THOU CEASE TO REMEMBER JOSEPH UNTIL THOU REACH THE LAST EXTREMITY OF ILLNESS  OR UNTIL THOU DIE    
   HE SAID     I ONLY COMPLAIN OF MY DISTRACTION AND ANGUISH TO GOD  AND I KNOW FROM GOD THAT WHICH YE KNOW NOT 
     O MY SONS   GO YE AND ENQUIRE ABOUT JOSEPH AND HIS BROTHER  AND NEVER GIVE UP HOPE OF GOD S SOOTHING MERCY   TRULY NO ONE DESPAIRS OF GOD S SOOTHING MERCY  EXCEPT THOSE WHO HAVE NO FAITH  
   THEN  WHEN THEY CAME  BACK  INTO  JOSEPH S  PRESENCE THEY SAID     O EXALTED ONE   DISTRESS HAS SEIZED US AND OUR FAMILY   WE HAVE  NOW  BROUGHT BUT SCANTY CAPITAL   SO PAY US FULL MEASURE   WE PRAY THEE   AND TREAT IT AS CHARITY TO US   FOR GOD DOTH REWARD THE CHARITABLE  
   HE SAID     KNOW YE HOW YE DEALT WITH JOSEPH AND HIS BROTHER  NOT KNOWING  WHAT YE WERE DOING     
   THEY SAID     ART THOU INDEED JOSEPH     HE SAID     I AM JOSEPH  AND THIS IS MY BROTHER   GOD HAS INDEED BEEN GRACIOUS TO US  ALL    BEHOLD  HE THAT IS RIGHTEOUS AND PATIENT  NEVER WILL GOD SUFFER THE REWARD TO BE LOST  OF THOSE WHO DO RIGHT  
   THEY SAID     BY GOD  INDEED HAS GOD PREFERRED THEE ABOVE US  AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF SIN    
   HE SAID     THIS DAY LET NO REPROACH BE  CAST  ON YOU   GOD WILL FORGIVE YOU  AND HE IS THE MOST MERCIFUL OF THOSE WHO SHOW MERCY  
     GO WITH THIS MY SHIRT  AND CAST IT OVER THE FACE OF MY FATHER   HE WILL COME TO SEE  CLEARLY   THEN COME YE  HERE  TO ME TOGETHER WITH ALL YOUR FAMILY  SECTION  
   WHEN THE CARAVAN LEFT  EGYPT   THEIR FATHER SAID     I DO INDEED SCENT THE PRESENCE OF JOSEPH   NAY  THINK ME NOT A DOTARD  
   THEY SAID     BY GOD   TRULY THOU ART IN THINE OLD WANDERING MIND  
   THEN WHEN THE BEARER OF THE GOOD NEWS CAME  HE CAST  THE SHIRT  OVER HIS FACE  AND HE FORTHWITH REGAINED CLEAR SIGHT  HE SAID     DID I NOT SAY TO YOU    I KNOW FROM GOD THAT WHICH YE KNOW NOT      
   THEY SAID     O OUR FATHER   ASK FOR US FORGIVENESS FOR OUR SINS  FOR WE WERE TRULY AT FAULT  
   HE SAID     SOON WILL I ASK MY LORD FOR FORGIVENESS FOR YOU   FOR HE IS INDEED OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL  
   THEN WHEN THEY ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF JOSEPH  HE PROVIDED A HOME FOR HIS PARENTS WITH HIMSELF  AND SAID     ENTER YE EGYPT  ALL  IN SAFETY IF IT PLEASE GOD  
   AND HE RAISED HIS PARENTS HIGH ON THE THRONE  OF DIGNITY   AND THEY FELL DOWN IN PROSTRATION   ALL  BEFORE HIM  HE SAID     O MY FATHER   THIS IS THE FULFILLMENT OF MY VISION OF OLD   GOD HATH MADE IT COME TRUE   HE WAS INDEED GOOD TO ME WHEN HE TOOK ME OUT OF PRISON AND BROUGHT YOU  ALL HERE  OUT OF THE DESERT   EVEN  AFTER SATAN HAD SOWN ENMITY BETWEEN ME AND MY BROTHERS  VERILY MY LORD UNDERSTANDETH BEST THE MYSTERIES OF ALL THAT HE PLANNETH TO DO  FOR VERILY HE IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM 
     O MY LORD   THOU HAST INDEED BESTOWED ON ME SOME POWER  AND TAUGHT ME SOMETHING OF THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS AND EVENTS  O THOU CREATOR OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   THOU ART MY PROTECTOR IN THIS WORLD AND IN THE HEREAFTER  TAKE THOU MY SOUL  AT DEATH  AS ONE SUBMITTING TO THY WILL  AS A MUSLIM   AND UNITE ME WITH THE RIGHTEOUS  
   SUCH IS ONE OF THE STORIES OF WHAT HAPPENED UNSEEN  WHICH WE REVEAL BY INSPIRATION UNTO THEE   NOR WAST THOU  PRESENT  WITH THEM WHEN THEY CONCERTED THEIR PLANS TOGETHER IN THE PROCESS OF WEAVING THEIR PLOTS 
   YET NO FAITH WILL THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND HAVE  HOWEVER ARDENTLY THOU DOST DESIRE IT 
   AND NO REWARD DOST THOU ASK OF THEM FOR THIS   IT IS NO LESS THAN A MESSAGE FOR ALL CREATURES SECTION  
   AND HOW MANY SIGNS IN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH DO THEY PASS BY   YET THEY TURN  THEIR FACES  AWAY FROM THEM  
   AND MOST OF THEM BELIEVE NOT IN GOD WITHOUT ASSOCIATING  OTHERS AS PARTNERS  WITH HIM  
   DO THEY THEN FEEL SECURE FROM THE COMING AGAINST THEM OF THE COVERING VEIL OF THE WRATH OF GOD   OR OF THE COMING AGAINST THEM OF THE  FINAL  HOUR ALL OF A SUDDEN WHILE THEY PERCEIVE NOT  
   SAY THOU     THIS IS MY WAY   I DO INVITE UNTO GOD   ON EVIDENCE CLEAR AS THE SEEING WITH ONE S EYES   I AND WHOEVER FOLLOWS ME  GLORY TO GOD   AND NEVER WILL I JOIN GODS WITH GOD    
   NOR DID WE SEND BEFORE THEE  AS APOSTLES  ANY BUT MEN  WHOM WE DID INSPIRE    MEN  LIVING IN HUMAN HABITATIONS  DO THEY NOT TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH  AND SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE BEFORE THEM   BUT THE HOME OF THE HEREAFTER IS BEST  FOR THOSE WHO DO RIGHT  WILL YE NOT THEN UNDERSTAND  
    RESPITE WILL BE GRANTED  UNTIL  WHEN THE APOSTLES GIVE UP HOPE  OF THEIR PEOPLE  AND  COME TO   THINK THAT THEY WERE TREATED AS LIARS  THERE REACHES THEM OUR HELP  AND THOSE WHOM WE WILL ARE DELIVERED INTO SAFETY  BUT NEVER WILL BE WARDED OFF OUR PUNISHMENT FROM THOSE WHO ARE IN SIN 
   THERE IS  IN THEIR STORIES  INSTRUCTION FOR MEN ENDUED WITH UNDERSTANDING  IT IS NOT A TALE INVENTED  BUT A CONFIRMATION OF WHAT WENT BEFORE IT   A DETAILED EXPOSITION OF ALL THINGS  AND A GUIDE AND A MERCY TO ANY SUCH AS BELIEVE 
   A  L  M  R  THESE ARE THE SIGNS  OR VERSES  OF THE BOOK   THAT WHICH HATH BEEN REVEALED UNTO THEE FROM THY LORD IS THE TRUTH   BUT MOST MEN BELIEVE NOT 
   GOD IS HE WHO RAISED THE HEAVENS WITHOUT ANY PILLARS THAT YE CAN SEE   IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED ON THE THRONE  OF AUTHORITY    HE HAS SUBJECTED THE SUN AND THE MOON  TO HIS LAW    EACH ONE RUNS  ITS COURSE  FOR A TERM APPOINTED  HE DOTH REGULATE ALL AFFAIRS  EXPLAINING THE SIGNS IN DETAIL  THAT YE MAY BELIEVE WITH CERTAINTY IN THE MEETING WITH YOUR LORD 
   AND IT IS HE WHO SPREAD OUT THE EARTH  AND SET THEREON MOUNTAINS STANDING FIRM  AND  FLOWING  RIVERS   AND FRUIT OF EVERY KIND HE MADE IN PAIRS  TWO AND TWO   HE DRAWETH THE NIGHT AS A VEIL O ER THE DAY  BEHOLD  VERILY IN THESE THINGS THERE ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE WHO CONSIDER  
   AND IN THE EARTH ARE TRACTS  DIVERSE THOUGH  NEIGHBOURING  AND GARDENS OF VINES AND FIELDS SOWN WITH CORN  AND PALM TREES GROWING OUT OF SINGLE ROOTS OR OTHERWISE   WATERED WITH THE SAME WATER  YET SOME OF THEM WE MAKE MORE EXCELLENT THAN OTHERS TO EAT  BEHOLD  VERILY IN THESE THINGS THERE ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND  
   IF THOU DOST MARVEL  AT THEIR WANT OF FAITH   STRANGE IS THEIR SAYING     WHEN WE ARE  ACTUALLY  DUST  SHALL WE INDEED THEN BE IN A CREATION RENEWED     THEY ARE THOSE WHO DENY THEIR LORD   THEY ARE THOSE ROUND WHOSE NECKS WILL BE YOKES  OF SERVITUDE    THEY WILL BE COMPANIONS OF THE FIRE  TO DWELL THEREIN  FOR AYE   
   THEY ASK THEE TO HASTEN ON THE EVIL IN PREFERENCE TO THE GOOD   YET HAVE COME TO PASS  BEFORE THEM   MANY  EXEMPLARY PUNISHMENTS   BUT VERILY THY LORD IS FULL OF FORGIVENESS FOR MANKIND FOR THEIR WRONG DOING  AND VERILY THY LORD IS  ALSO  STRICT IN PUNISHMENT 
   AND THE UNBELIEVERS SAY     WHY IS NOT A SIGN SENT DOWN TO HIM FROM HIS LORD     BUT THOU ART TRULY A WARNER  AND TO EVERY PEOPLE A GUIDE SECTION  
   GOD DOTH KNOW WHAT EVERY FEMALE  WOMB  DOTH BEAR  BY HOW MUCH THE WOMBS FALL SHORT  OF THEIR TIME OR NUMBER  OR DO EXCEED  EVERY SINGLE THING IS BEFORE HIS SIGHT  IN  DUE  PROPORTION 
   HE KNOWETH THE UNSEEN AND THAT WHICH IS OPEN   HE IS THE GREAT  THE MOST HIGH 
   IT IS THE SAME  TO HIM  WHETHER ANY OF YOU CONCEAL HIS SPEECH OR DECLARE IT OPENLY   WHETHER HE LIE HID BY NIGHT OR WALK FREELY BY DAY 
   FOR EACH  SUCH PERSON  THERE ARE  ANGELS  IN SUCCESSION  BEFORE AND BEHIND HIM   THEY GUARD HIM BY COMMAND OF GOD  VERILY NEVER WILL GOD CHANGE THE CONDITION OF A PEOPLE UNTIL THEY CHANGE IT THEMSELVES  WITH THEIR OWN SOULS   BUT WHEN  ONCE  GOD WILLETH A PEOPLE S PUNISHMENT  THERE CAN BE NO TURNING IT BACK  NOR WILL THEY FIND  BESIDES HIM  ANY TO PROTECT 
   IT IS HE WHO DOTH SHOW YOU THE LIGHTNING  BY WAY BOTH OF FEAR AND OF HOPE   IT IS HE WHO DOTH RAISE UP THE CLOUDS  HEAVY WITH  FERTILISING  RAIN  
   NAY  THUNDER REPEATETH HIS PRAISES  AND SO DO THE ANGELS  WITH AWE   HE FLINGETH THE LOUD VOICED THUNDER BOLTS  AND THEREWITH HE STRIKETH WHOMSOEVER HE WILL YET THESE  ARE THE MEN  WHO  DARE TO  DISPUTE ABOUT GOD  WITH THE STRENGTH OF HIS POWER  SUPREME   
   FOR HIM  ALONE  IS PRAYER IN TRUTH   ANY OTHERS THAT THEY CALL UPON BESIDES HIM HEAR THEM NO MORE THAN IF THEY WERE TO STRETCH FORTH THEIR HANDS FOR WATER TO REACH THEIR MOUTHS BUT IT REACHES THEM NOT   FOR THE PRAYER OF THOSE WITHOUT FAITH IS NOTHING BUT  FUTILE  WANDERING  IN THE MIND  
   WHATEVER BEINGS THERE ARE IN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH DO PROSTRATE THEMSELVES TO GOD  ACKNOWLEDGING SUBJECTION   WITH GOOD WILL OR IN SPITE OF THEMSELVES   SO DO THEIR SHADOWS IN THE MORNINGS AND EVENINGS 
   SAY    WHO IS THE LORD AND SUSTAINER OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH     SAY      IT IS  GOD   SAY     DO YE THEN TAKE  FOR WORSHIP  PROTECTORS OTHER THAN HIM  SUCH AS HAVE NO POWER EITHER FOR GOOD OR FOR HARM TO THEMSELVES     SAY     ARE THE BLIND EQUAL WITH THOSE WHO SEE   OR THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS EQUAL WITH LIGHT     OR DO THEY ASSIGN TO GOD PARTNERS WHO HAVE CREATED  ANYTHING  AS HE HAS CREATED  SO THAT THE CREATION SEEMED TO THEM SIMILAR   SAY     GOD IS THE CREATOR OF ALL THINGS   HE IS THE ONE  THE SUPREME AND IRRESISTIBLE  
   HE SENDS DOWN WATER FROM THE SKIES  AND THE CHANNELS FLOW  EACH ACCORDING TO ITS MEASURE   BUT THE TORRENT BEARS AWAY THE FOAM THAT MOUNTS UP TO THE SURFACE  EVEN SO  FROM THAT  ORE  WHICH THEY HEAT IN THE FIRE  TO MAKE ORNAMENTS OR UTENSILS THEREWITH  THERE IS A SCUM LIKEWISE  THUS DOTH GOD  BY PARABLES  SHOW FORTH TRUTH AND VANITY  FOR THE SCUM DISAPPEARS LIKE FROTH CAST OUT   WHILE THAT WHICH IS FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND REMAINS ON THE EARTH  THUS DOTH GOD SET FORTH PARABLES 
   FOR THOSE WHO RESPOND TO THEIR LORD  ARE  ALL  GOOD THINGS  BUT THOSE WHO RESPOND NOT TO HIM   EVEN IF THEY HAD ALL THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  AND AS MUCH MORE   IN VAIN  WOULD THEY OFFER IT FOR RANSOM  FOR THEM WILL THE RECKONING BE TERRIBLE   THEIR ABODE WILL BE HELL   WHAT A BED OF MISERY  SECTION  
   IS THEN ONE WHO DOTH KNOW THAT THAT WHICH HATH BEEN REVEALED UNTO THEE FROM THY LORD IS THE TRUTH  LIKE ONE WHO IS BLIND   IT IS THOSE WHO ARE ENDUED WITH UNDERSTANDING THAT RECEIVE ADMONITION   
   THOSE WHO FULFIL THE COVENANT OF GOD AND FAIL NOT IN THEIR PLIGHTED WORD  
   THOSE WHO JOIN TOGETHER THOSE THINGS WHICH GOD HATH COMMANDED TO BE JOINED  HOLD THEIR LORD IN AWE  AND FEAR THE TERRIBLE RECKONING  
   THOSE WHO PATIENTLY PERSEVERE  SEEKING THE COUNTENANCE THEIR LORD   ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS   SPEND  OUT OF  THE GIFTS  WE HAVE BESTOWED FOR THEIR SUSTENANCE  SECRETLY AND OPENLY   AND TURN OFF EVIL WITH GOOD   FOR SUCH THERE IS THE FINAL ATTAINMENT OF THE  ETERNAL  HOME  
   GARDENS OF PERPETUAL BLISS   THEY SHALL ENTER THERE  AS WELL AS THE RIGHTEOUS AMONG THEIR FATHERS  THEIR SPOUSES  AND THEIR OFFSPRING   AND ANGELS SHALL ENTER UNTO THEM FROM EVERY GATE  WITH THE SALUTATION   
     PEACE UNTO YOU FOR THAT YE PERSEVERED IN PATIENCE   NOW HOW EXCELLENT IS THE FINAL HOME    
   BUT THOSE WHO BREAK THE COVENANT OF GOD  AFTER HAVING PLIGHTED THEIR WORD THERETO  AND CUT ASUNDER THOSE THINGS WHICH GOD HAS COMMANDED TO BE JOINED  AND WORK MISCHIEF IN THE LAND   ON THEM IS THE CURSE   FOR THEM IS THE TERRIBLE HOME  
   GOD DOTH ENLARGE  OR GRANT BY  STRICT  MEASURE  THE SUSTENANCE  WHICH HE GIVETH  TO WHOMSO HE PLEASETH   THE WORLDLY  REJOICE IN THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD   BUT THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD IS BUT LITTLE COMFORT IN THE HEREAFTER SECTION  
   THE UNBELIEVERS SAY     WHY IS NOT A SIGN SENT DOWN TO HIM FROM HIS LORD     SAY     TRULY GOD LEAVETH  TO STRAY  WHOM HE WILL   BUT HE GUIDETH TO HIMSELF THOSE WHO TURN TO HIM IN PENITENCE  
     THOSE WHO BELIEVE  AND WHOSE HEARTS FIND SATISFACTION IN THE REMEMBRANCE OF GOD   FOR WITHOUT DOUBT IN THE REMEMBRANCE OF GOD DO HEARTS FIND SATISFACTION 
     FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS  IS  EVERY  BLESSEDNESS  AND A BEAUTIFUL PLACE OF  FINAL  RETURN  
   THUS HAVE WE SENT THEE AMONGST A PEOPLE BEFORE WHOM  LONG SINCE  HAVE  OTHER  PEOPLES  GONE AND  PASSED AWAY   IN ORDER THAT THOU MIGHTEST REHEARSE UNTO THEM WHAT WE SEND DOWN UNTO THEE BY INSPIRATION   YET DO THEY REJECT  HIM   THE MOST GRACIOUS   SAY     HE IS MY LORD   THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE   ON HIM IS MY TRUST  AND TO HIM DO I TURN    
   IF THERE WERE A QUR ĀN WITH WHICH MOUNTAINS WERE MOVED  OR THE EARTH WERE CLOVEN ASUNDER  OR THE DEAD WERE MADE TO SPEAK   THIS WOULD BE THE ONE    BUT TRULY  THE COMMAND IS WITH GOD IN ALL THINGS   DO NOT THE BELIEVERS KNOW  THAT  HAD GOD  SO  WILLED  HE COULD HAVE GUIDED ALL MANKIND  TO THE RIGHT    BUT THE UNBELIEVERS  NEVER WILL DISASTER CEASE TO SEIZE THEM FOR THEIR  ILL  DEEDS  OR TO SETTLE CLOSE TO THEIR HOMES  UNTIL THE PROMISE OF GOD COME TO PASS  FOR  VERILY  GOD WILL NOT FAIL IN HIS PROMISE SECTION  
   MOCKED WERE  MANY  APOSTLES BEFORE THEE   BUT I GRANTED RESPITE TO THE UNBELIEVERS  AND FINALLY I PUNISHED THEM   THEN HOW  TERRIBLE  WAS MY REQUITAL  
   IS THEN HE WHO STANDETH OVER EVERY SOUL  AND KNOWETH  ALL THAT IT DOTH   LIKE ANY OTHERS    AND YET THEY ASCRIBE PARTNERS TO GOD  SAY     BUT NAME THEM   IS IT THAT YE WILL INFORM HIM OF SOMETHING HE KNOWETH NOT ON EARTH  OR IS IT  JUST  A SHOW OF WORDS     NAY   TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT  THEIR PRETENCE SEEMS PLEASING  BUT THEY ARE KEPT BACK  THEREBY  FROM THE PATH  AND THOSE WHOM GOD LEAVES TO STRAY  NO ONE CAN GUIDE 
   FOR THEM IS A PENALTY IN THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD  BUT HARDER  TRULY  IS THE PENALTY OF THE HEREAFTER   AND DEFENDER HAVE THEY NONE AGAINST GOD 
   THE PARABLE OF THE GARDEN WHICH THE RIGHTEOUS ARE PROMISED    BENEATH IF FLOW RIVERS   PERPETUAL IS THE ENJOYMENT THEREOF AND THE SHADE THEREIN   SUCH IS THE END OF THE RIGHTEOUS   AND THE END OF UNBELIEVERS IS THE FIRE 
   THOSE TO WHOM WE HAVE GIVEN THE BOOK REJOICE AT WHAT HATH BEEN REVEALED UNTO THEE   BUT THERE ARE AMONG THE CLANS THOSE WHO REJECT A PART THEREOF  SAY     I AM COMMANDED TO WORSHIP GOD  AND NOT TO JOIN PARTNERS WITH HIM  UNTO HIM DO I CALL  AND UNTO HIM IS MY RETURN  
   THUS HAVE WE REVEALED IT TO BE A JUDGMENT OF AUTHORITY IN ARABIC  WERT THOU TO FOLLOW THEIR  VAIN  DESIRES AFTER THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH HATH REACHED THEE  THEN WOULDST THOU FIND NEITHER PROTECTOR NOR DEFENDER AGAINST GOD SECTION  
   WE DID SEND APOSTLES BEFORE THEE  AND APPOINTED FOR THEM WIVES AND CHILDREN   AND IT WAS NEVER THE PART OF AN APOSTLE TO BRING A SIGN EXCEPT AS GOD PERMITTED  OR COMMANDED   FOR EACH PERIOD IS A BOOK  REVEALED  
   GOD DOTH BLOT OUT OR CONFIRM WHAT HE PLEASETH   WITH HIM IS THE MOTHER OF THE BOOK 
   WHETHER WE SHALL SHOW THEE  WITHIN THY LIFE TIME  PART OF WHAT WE PROMISED THEM OR TAKE TO OURSELVES THY SOUL  BEFORE IT IS ALL ACCOMPLISHED   THY DUTY IS TO MAKE  THE MESSAGE  REACH THEM   IT IS OUR PART TO CALL THEM TO ACCOUNT 
   SEE THEY NOT THAT WE GRADUALLY REDUCE THE LAND  IN THEIR CONTROL  FROM ITS OUTLYING BORDERS    WHERE  GOD COMMANDS  THERE IS NONE TO PUT BACK HIS COMMAND   AND HE IS SWIFT IN CALLING TO ACCOUNT 
   THOSE BEFORE THEM DID  ALSO  DEVISE PLOTS   BUT IN ALL THINGS THE MASTER PLANNING IS GOD S  HE KNOWETH THE DOINGS OF EVERY SOUL   AND SOON WILL THE UNBELIEVERS KNOW WHO GETS HOME IN THE END 
   THE UNBELIEVERS SAY     NO APOSTLE ART THOU   SAY     ENOUGH FOR A WITNESS BETWEEN ME AND YOU IS GOD  AND SUCH AS HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE BOOK  
   A  L  R  A BOOK WHICH WE HAVE REVEALED UNTO THEE  IN ORDER THAT THOU MIGHTEST LEAD MANKIND OUT OF THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS INTO LIGHT BY THE LEAVE OF THEIR LORD TO THE WAY OF  HIM  EXALTED IN POWER  WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE   
   OF GOD  TO WHOM DO BELONG ALL THINGS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   BUT ALAS FOR THE UNBELIEVERS FOR A TERRIBLE PENALTY  THEIR UNFAITH WILL BRING THEM    
   THOSE WHO LOVE THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD MORE THAN THE HEREAFTER  WHO HINDER  MEN  FROM THE PATH OF GOD AND SEEK THEREIN SOMETHING CROOKED   THEY ARE ASTRAY BY A LONG DISTANCE 
   WE SENT NOT AN APOSTLE EXCEPT  TO TEACH  IN THE LANGUAGE OF HIS  OWN  PEOPLE  IN ORDER TO MAKE  THINGS  CLEAR TO THEM  NOW GOD LEAVES STRAYING THOSE WHOM HE PLEASES AND GUIDES WHOM HE PLEASES   AND HE IS EXALTED IN POWER  FULL OF WISDOM 
   WE SENT MOSES WITH OUR SIGNS  AND THE COMMAND     BRING OUT THY PEOPLE FROM THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS INTO LIGHT  AND TEACH THEM TO REMEMBER THE DAYS OF GOD   VERILY IN THIS THERE ARE SIGNS FOR SUCH AS ARE FIRMLY PATIENT AND CONSTANT  GRATEFUL AND APPRECIATIVE 
   REMEMBER   MOSES SAID TO HIS PEOPLE     CALL TO MIND THE FAVOR OF GOD TO YOU WHEN HE DELIVERED YOU FROM THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH   THEY SET YOU HARD TASKS AND PUNISHMENTS  SLAUGHTERED YOUR SONS  AND LET YOUR WOMEN FOLK LIVE   THEREIN WAS A TREMENDOUS TRIAL FROM YOUR LORD  SECTION  
   AND REMEMBER   YOUR LORD CAUSED TO BE DECLARED  PUBLICLY      IF YE ARE GRATEFUL  I WILL ADD MORE  FAVOURS  UNTO YOU   BUT IF YE SHOW INGRATITUDE  TRULY MY PUNISHMENT IS TERRIBLE INDEED  
   AND MOSES SAID     IF YE SHOW INGRATITUDE  YE AND ALL ON EARTH TOGETHER  YET IS GOD FREE OF ALL WANTS  WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE 
   HAS NOT THE STORY REACHED YOU   O PEOPLE     OF THOSE WHO  WENT  BEFORE YOU    OF THE PEOPLE OF NOAH AND  ĀD AND THAMŪD    AND OF THOSE WHO  CAME  AFTER THEM   NONE KNOWS THEM BUT GOD  TO THEM CAME APOSTLES WITH CLEAR  SIGNS    BUT THEY PUT THEIR HANDS UP TO THEIR MOUTHS  AND SAID     WE DO DENY  THE MISSION  ON WHICH YE HAVE BEEN SENT  AND WE ARE REALLY IN SUSPICIOUS  DISQUIETING  DOUBT AS TO THAT TO WHICH YE INVITE US  
   THEIR APOSTLES SAID     IS THERE A DOUBT ABOUT GOD  THE CREATOR OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   IT IS HE WHO INVITES YOU  IN ORDER THAT HE MAY FORGIVE YOU YOUR SINS AND GIVE YOU RESPITE FOR A TERM APPOINTED     THEY SAID     AH   YE ARE NO MORE THAN HUMAN  LIKE OURSELVES   YE WISH TO TURN US AWAY FROM THE  GODS  OUR FATHERS USED TO WORSHIP   THEN BRING US SOME CLEAR AUTHORITY  
   THEIR APOSTLES SAID TO THEM     TRUE  WE ARE HUMAN LIKE YOURSELVES  BUT GOD DOTH GRANT HIS GRACE TO SUCH OF HIS SERVANTS AS HE PLEASES  IT IS NOT FOR US TO BRING YOU AN AUTHORITY EXCEPT AS GOD PERMITS  AND ON GOD LET ALL MEN OF FAITH PUT THEIR TRUST 
     NO REASON HAVE WE WHY WE SHOULD NOT PUT OUR TRUST ON GOD  INDEED HE HAS GUIDED US TO THE WAYS WE  FOLLOW   WE SHALL CERTAINLY BEAR WITH PATIENCE ALL THE HURT YOU MAY CAUSE US  FOR THOSE WHO PUT THEIR TRUST SHOULD PUT THEIR TRUST ON GOD  SECTION  
   AND THE UNBELIEVERS SAID TO THEIR APOSTLES     BE SURE WE SHALL DRIVE YOU OUT OF OUR LAND  OR YE SHALL RETURN TO OUR RELIGION   BUT THEIR LORD INSPIRED  THIS MESSAGE  TO THEM     VERILY WE SHALL CAUSE THE WRONG DOERS TO PERISH  
     AND VERILY WE SHALL CAUSE YOU TO ABIDE IN THE LAND  AND SUCCEED THEM  THIS FOR SUCH AS FEAR THE TIME WHEN THEY SHALL STAND BEFORE MY TRIBUNAL  SUCH AS FEAR THE PUNISHMENT DENOUNCED  
   BUT THEY SOUGHT VICTORY AND DECISION  THERE AND THEN   AND FRUSTRATION WAS THE LOT OF EVERY POWERFUL OBSTINATE TRANSGRESSOR 
   IN FRONT OF SUCH A ONE IS HELL  AND HE IS GIVEN  FOR DRINK  BOILING FETID WATER 
   IN GULPS WILL HE SIP IT  BUT NEVER WELL HE BE NEAR SWALLOWING IT DOWN HIS THROAT   DEATH WILL COME TO HIM FROM EVERY QUARTER  YET WILL HE NOT DIE   AND IN FRONT OF HIM WILL BE A CHASTISEMENT UNRELENTING 
   THE PARABLE OF THOSE WHO REJECT THEIR LORD IS THAT THEIR WORKS ARE AS ASHES  ON WHICH THE WIND BLOWS FURIOUSLY ON A TEMPESTUOUS DAY   NO POWER HAVE THEY OVER AUGHT THAT THEY HAVE EARNED   THAT IS THE STRAYING FAR  FAR  FROM THE GOAL  
   SEEST THOU NOT THAT GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH IN TRUTH   IF HE SO WILL  HE CAN REMOVE YOU AND PUT  IN YOUR PLACE  A NEW CREATION  
   NOR IS THAT FOR GOD ANY GREAT MATTER 
   THEY WILL ALL BE MARSHALLED BEFORE GOD TOGETHER   THEN WILL THE WEAK SAY TO THOSE WHO WERE ARROGANT    FOR US  WE BUT FOLLOWED YOU   CAN YE THEN AVAIL US AT ALL AGAINST THE WRATH OF GOD     THEY WILL REPLY    IF WE HAD RECEIVED THE GUIDANCE OF GOD  WE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU   TO US IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE  NOW  WHETHER WE RAGE  OR BEAR  THESE TORMENTS  WITH PATIENCE   FOR OURSELVES THERE IS NO WAY OF ESCAPE  SECTION  
   AND SATAN WILL SAY WHEN THE MATTER IS DECIDED     IT WAS GOD WHO GAVE YOU A PROMISE OF TRUTH   I TOO PROMISED  BUT I FAILED IN MY PROMISE TO YOU  I HAD NO AUTHORITY OVER YOU EXCEPT TO CALL YOU  BUT YE LISTENED TO ME   THEN REPROACH NOT ME  BUT REPROACH YOUR OWN SOULS  I CANNOT LISTEN TO YOUR CRIES  NOR CAN YE LISTEN TO MINE  I REJECT YOUR FORMER ACT IN ASSOCIATING ME WITH GOD  FOR WRONG DOERS THERE MUST BE A GRIEVOUS PENALTY  
   BUT THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL BE ADMITTED TO GARDENS BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW   TO DWELL THEREIN FOR AYE WITH THE LEAVE OF THEIR LORD  THEIR GREETING THEREIN WILL BE     PEACE    
   SEEST THOU NOT HOW GOD SETS FORTH A PARABLE    A GOODLY WORD LIKE A GOODLY TREE  WHOSE ROOT IS FIRMLY FIXED  AND ITS BRANCHES  REACH  TO THE HEAVENS  
   IT BRINGS FORTH ITS FRUIT AT ALL TIMES  BY THE LEAVE OF ITS LORD  SO GOD SETS FORTH PARABLES FOR MEN  IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY RECEIVE ADMONITION 
   AND THE PARABLE OF AN EVIL WORD IS THAT OF AN EVIL TREE   IT IS TORN UP BY THE ROOT FROM THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH   IT HAS NO STABILITY 
   GOD WILL ESTABLISH IN STRENGTH THOSE WHO BELIEVE  WITH THE WORD THAT STANDS FIRM  IN THIS WORLD AND IN THE HEREAFTER   BUT GOD WILL LEAVE  TO STRAY  THOSE WHO DO WRONG   GOD DOETH WHAT HE WILLETH SECTION  
   HAST THOU NOT TURNED THY VISION TO THOSE WHO HAVE CHANGED THE FAVOUR OF GOD INTO BLASPHEMY AND CAUSED THEIR PEOPLE TO DESCEND TO THE HOUSE OF PERDITION   
   INTO HELL   THEY WILL BURN THEREIN  AN EVIL PLACE TO STAY IN  
   AND THEY SET UP  IDOLS  AS EQUAL TO GOD  TO MISLEAD  MEN  FROM THE PATH   SAY     ENJOY  YOUR BRIEF POWER    BUT VERILY YE ARE MAKING STRAIGHTWAY FOR HELL    
   SPEAK TO MY SERVANTS WHO HAVE BELIEVED  THAT THEY MAY ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS  AND SPEND  IN CHARITY  OUT OF THE SUSTENANCE WE HAVE GIVEN THEM  SECRETLY AND OPENLY  BEFORE THE COMING OF A DAY IN WHICH THERE WILL BE NEITHER MUTUAL BARGAINING NOR BEFRIENDING 
   IT IS GOD WHO HATH CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND SENDETH DOWN RAIN FROM THE SKIES  AND WITH IT BRINGETH OUT FRUITS WHEREWITH TO FEED YOU   IT IS HE WHO HATH MADE THE SHIPS SUBJECT TO YOU  THAT THEY MAY SAIL THROUGH THE SEA BY HIS COMMAND   AND THE RIVERS  ALSO  HATH HE MADE SUBJECT TO YOU 
   AND HE HATH MADE SUBJECT TO YOU THE SUN AND THE MOON  BOTH DILIGENTLY PURSUING THEIR COURSES   AND THE NIGHT AND THE DAY HATH HE  ALSO  MADE SUBJECT YOU 
   AND HE GIVETH YOU OF ALL THAT YE ASK FOR  BUT IF YE COUNT THE FAVOURS OF GOD  NEVER WILL YE BE ABLE TO NUMBER THEM  VERILY  MAN IS GIVEN UP TO INJUSTICE AND INGRATITUDE SECTION  
   REMEMBER ABRAHAM SAID     O MY LORD   MAKE THIS CITY ONE OF PEACE AND SECURITY   AND PRESERVE ME AND MY SONS FROM WORSHIPPING IDOLS 
     O MY LORD   THEY HAVE INDEED LED ASTRAY MANY AMONG MANKIND   HE THEN WHO FOLLOWS MY  WAYS  IS OF ME  AND HE THAT DISOBEYS ME  BUT THOU ART INDEED OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
     O OUR LORD   I HAVE MADE SOME OF MY OFFSPRING TO DWELL IN A VALLEY WITHOUT CULTIVATION  BY THY SACRED HOUSE   IN ORDER  O OUR LORD  THAT THEY MAY ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER   SO FILL THE HEARTS OF SOME AMONG MEN WITH LOVE TOWARDS THEM  AND FEED THEM WITH FRUITS   SO THAT THEY MAY GIVE THANKS 
     O OUR LORD   TRULY THOU DOST KNOW WHAT WE CONCEAL AND WHAT WE REVEAL   FOR NOTHING WHATEVER IS HIDDEN FROM GOD  WHETHER ON EARTH OR IN HEAVEN 
     PRAISE BE TO GOD  WHO HATH GRANTED UNTO ME IN OLD AGE ISMĀ ĪL AND ISAAC   FOR TRULY MY LORD IS HE  THE HEARER OF PRAYER  
     O MY LORD   MAKE ME ONE WHO ESTABLISHES REGULAR PRAYER  AND ALSO  RAISE SUCH  AMONG MY OFFSPRING O OUR LORD   AND ACCEPT THOU MY PRAYER 
     O OUR LORD   COVER  US  WITH THY FORGIVENESS ME  MY PARENTS  AND  ALL  BELIEVERS  ON THE DAY THAT THE RECKONING WILL BE ESTABLISHED    SECTION  
   THINK NOT THAT GOD DOTH NOT HEED THE DEEDS OF THOSE WHO DO WRONG  HE BUT GIVETH THEM RESPITE AGAINST A DAY WHEN THE EYES WILL FIXEDLY STARE IN HORROR  
   THEY RUNNING FORWARD WITH NECKS OUTSTRETCHED  THEIR HEADS UPLIFTED  THEIR GAZE RETURNING NOT TOWARDS THEM  AND THEIR HEARTS A  GAPING  VOID  
   SO WARN MANKIND OF THE DAY WHEN THE WRATH WILL REACH THEM   THEN WILL THE WRONG DOERS SAY     OUR LORD   RESPITE US  IF ONLY  FOR A SHORT TERM   WE WILL ANSWER THY CALL  AND FOLLOW THE APOSTLES       WHAT   WERE YE NOT WONT TO SWEAR AFORETIME THAT YE SHOULD SUFFER NO DECLINE  
     AND YE DWELT IN THE DWELLINGS OF MEN WHO WRONGED THEIR OWN SOULS   YE WERE CLEARLY SHOWN HOW WE DEALT WITH THEM   AND WE PUT FORTH MANY PARABLES IN YOUR BEHOOF    
   MIGHTY INDEED WERE THE PLOTS WHICH THEY MADE  BUT THEIR PLOTS WERE  WELL  WITHIN THE SIGHT OF GOD  EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SUCH AS TO SHAKE THE HILLS  
   NEVER THINK THAT GOD WOULD FAIL HIS APOSTLES IN HIS PROMISE   FOR GOD IS EXALTED IN POWER   THE LORD OF RETRIBUTION 
   ONE DAY THE EARTH WILL BE CHANGED TO A DIFFERENT EARTH  AND SO WILL BE THE HEAVENS  AND  MEN  WILL BE MARSHALLED FORTH  BEFORE GOD  THE ONE  THE IRRESISTIBLE  
   AND THOU WILT SEE THE SINNERS THAT DAY BOUND TOGETHER IN FETTERS   
   THEIR GARMENTS OF LIQUID PITCH  AND THEIR FACES COVERED WITH FIRE  
   THAT GOD MAY REQUITE EACH SOUL ACCORDING TO ITS DESERTS   AND VERILY GOD IS SWIFT IN CALLING TO ACCOUNT 
   HERE IS A MESSAGE FOR MANKIND  LET THEM TAKE WARNING THEREFROM  AND LET THEM KNOW THAT HE IS  NO OTHER THAN  ONE GOD   LET MEN OF UNDERSTANDING TAKE HEED 
   A  L  R  THESE ARE THE ĀYATS OF REVELATION   OF A QUR ĀN THAT MAKES THINGS CLEAR 
   AGAIN AND AGAIN WILL THOSE WHO DISBELIEVE  WISH THAT THEY HAD BOWED  TO GOD S WILL  IN ISLĀM 
   LEAVE THEM ALONE  TO ENJOY  THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS LIFE  AND TO PLEASE THEMSELVES   LET  FALSE  HOPE AMUSE THEM   SOON WILL KNOWLEDGE  UNDECEIVE THEM  
   NEVER DID WE DESTROY A POPULATION THAT HAD NOT A TERM DECREED AND ASSIGNED BEFOREHAND 
   NEITHER CAN A PEOPLE ANTICIPATE ITS TERM  NOR DELAY IT 
   THEY SAY     O THOU TO WHOM THE MESSAGE IS BEING REVEALED   TRULY THOU ART MAD  OR POSSESSED   
     WHY BRINGEST THOU NOT ANGELS TO US IF IT BE THAT THOU HAST THE TRUTH    
   WE SEND NOT THE ANGELS DOWN EXCEPT FOR JUST CAUSE   IF THEY CAME  TO THE UNGODLY   BEHOLD   NO RESPITE WOULD THEY HAVE  
   WE HAVE  WITHOUT DOUBT  SENT DOWN THE MESSAGE   AND WE WILL ASSUREDLY GUARD IT  FROM CORRUPTION  
   WE DID SEND APOSTLES BEFORE THEE AMONGST THE RELIGIOUS SECTS OF OLD  
   BUT NEVER CAME AN APOSTLE TO THEM BUT THEY MOCKED HIM 
   EVEN SO DO WE LET IT CREEP INTO THE HEARTS OF THE SINNERS 
   THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BELIEVE IN THE  MESSAGE    BUT THE WAYS OF THE ANCIENTS HAVE PASSED AWAY 
   EVEN IF WE OPENED OUT TO THEM A GATE FROM HEAVEN  AND THEY WERE TO CONTINUE  ALL DAY  ASCENDING THEREIN 
   THEY WOULD ONLY SAY     OUR EYES HAVE BEEN INTOXICATED   NAY  WE HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED BY SORCERY  SECTION  
   IT IS WE WHO HAVE SET OUT THE ZODIACAL SIGNS IN THE HEAVENS  AND MADE THEM FAIR SEEMING TO  ALL  BEHOLDERS  
   AND  MOREOVER  WE HAVE GUARDED THEM FROM EVERY EVIL SPIRIT ACCURSED  
   BUT ANY THAT GAINS A HEARING BY STEALTH  IS PURSUED BY A FLAMING FIRE  BRIGHT  TO SEE  
   AND THE EARTH WE HAVE SPREAD OUT  LIKE A CARPET    SET THEREON MOUNTAINS FIRM AND IMMOVABLE   AND PRODUCED THEREIN ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN DUE BALANCE 
   AND WE HAVE PROVIDED THEREIN MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE  FOR YOU AND FOR THOSE FOR WHOSE SUSTENANCE YE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE 
   AND THERE IS NOT A THING BUT ITS  SOURCES AND  TREASURES  INEXHAUSTIBLE  ARE WITH US   BUT WE ONLY SEND DOWN THEREOF IN DUE AND ASCERTAINABLE MEASURES 
   AND WE SEND THE FECUNDATING WINDS  THEN CAUSE THE RAIN TO DESCEND FROM THE SKY  THEREWITH PROVIDING YOU WITH WATER  IN ABUNDANCE   THOUGH YE ARE NOT THE GUARDIANS OF ITS STORES 
   AND VERILY  IT IS WE WHO GIVE LIFE  AND WHO GIVE DEATH   IT IS WE WHO REMAIN INHERITORS  AFTER ALL ELSE PASSES AWAY  
   TO US ARE KNOWN THOSE OF YOU WHO HASTEN FORWARD  AND THOSE WHO LAG BEHIND 
   ASSUREDLY IT IS THY LORD WHO WILL GATHER THEM TOGETHER   FOR HE IS PERFECT IN WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE SECTION  
   WE CREATED MAN FROM SOUNDING CLAY  FROM MUD MOULDED INTO SHAPE  
   AND THE JINN RACE  WE HAD CREATED BEFORE  FROM THE FIRE OF A SCORCHING WIND 
   BEHOLD   THY LORD SAID TO THE ANGELS     I AM ABOUT TO CREATE MAN  FROM SOUNDING CLAY  FROM MUD MOULDED INTO SHAPE  
     WHEN I HAVE FASHIONED HIM  IN DUE PROPORTION  AND BREATHED INTO HIM OF MY SPIRIT  FALL YE DOWN IN OBEISANCE UNTO HIM  
   SO THE ANGELS PROSTRATED THEMSELVES  ALL OF THEM TOGETHER  
   NOT SO IBLĪS   HE REFUSED TO BE AMONG THOSE WHO PROSTRATED THEMSELVES 
    GOD  SAID     O IBLĪS   WHAT IS YOUR REASON FOR NOT BEING AMONG THOSE WHO PROSTRATED THEMSELVES    
    IBLĪS  SAID     I AM NOT ONE TO PROSTRATE MYSELF TO MAN  WHOM THOU DIDST CREATE FROM SOUNDING CLAY  FROM MUD MOULDED INTO SHAPE  
    GOD  SAID     THEN GET THEE OUT FROM HERE   FOR THOU ART REJECTED  ACCURSED 
     AND THE CURSE SHALL BE ON THEE TILL THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  
    IBLĪS  SAID     O MY LORD   GIVE ME THEN RESPITE TILL THE DAY THE  DEAD  ARE RAISED  
    GOD  SAID     RESPITE IS GRANTED THEE 
     TILL THE DAY OF THE TIME APPOINTED  
    IBLĪS  SAID     O MY LORD   BECAUSE THOU HAST PUT ME IN THE WRONG  I WILL MAKE  WRONG  FAIR SEEMING TO THEM ON THE EARTH  AND I WILL PUT THEM ALL IN THE WRONG  
     EXCEPT THY SERVANTS AMONG THEM  SINCERE AND PURIFIED  BY THY GRACE   
    GOD  SAID     THIS  WAY OF MY SINCERE SERVANTS  IS INDEED A WAY THAT LEADS STRAIGHT TO ME 
     FOR OVER MY SERVANTS NO AUTHORITY SHALT THOU HAVE  EXCEPT SUCH AS PUT THEMSELVES IN THE WRONG AND FOLLOW THEE  
   AND VERILY  HELL IS THE PROMISED ABODE FOR THEM ALL  
   TO IT ARE SEVEN GATES   FOR EACH OF THOSE GATES IS A  SPECIAL  CLASS  OF SINNERS  ASSIGNED SECTION  
   THE RIGHTEOUS  WILL BE  AMID GARDENS AND FOUNTAINS  OF CLEAR FLOWING WATER  
    THEIR GREETING WILL BE      ENTER YE HERE IN PEACE AND SECURITY  
   AND WE SHALL REMOVE FROM THEIR HEARTS ANY LURKING SENSE OF INJURY    THEY WILL BE  BROTHERS  JOYFULLY  FACING EACH OTHER ON THRONES  OF DIGNITY  
   THERE NO SENSE OF FATIGUE SHALL TOUCH THEM  NOR SHALL THEY  EVER  BE ASKED TO LEAVE 
   TELL MY SERVANTS THAT I AM INDEED THE OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL  
   AND THAT MY PENALTY WILL BE INDEED THE MOST GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   TELL THEM ABOUT THE GUESTS OF ABRAHAM 
   WHEN THEY ENTERED HIS PRESENCE AND SAID    PEACE     HE SAID    WE FEEL AFRAID OF YOU    
   THEY SAID     FEAR NOT   WE GIVE THEE GLAD TIDINGS OF A SON ENDOWED WITH WISDOM  
   HE SAID     DO YE GIVE ME GLAD TIDINGS THAT OLD AGE HAS SEIZED ME   OF WHAT  THEN  IS YOUR GOOD NEWS    
   THEY SAID     WE GIVE THEE GLAD TIDINGS IN TRUTH   BE NOT THEN IN DESPAIR    
   HE SAID     AND WHO DESPAIRS OF THE MERCY OF HIS LORD  BUT SUCH AS GO ASTRAY    
   ABRAHAM SAID     WHAT THEN IS THE BUSINESS ON WHICH YE  HAVE COME   O YE MESSENGERS  OF GOD     
   THEY SAID     WE HAVE BEEN SENT TO A PEOPLE  DEEP  IN SIN 
     EXCEPTING THE ADHERENTS OF LŪṬ   THEM WE ARE CERTAINLY  CHARGED  TO SAVE  FROM HARM    ALL 
     EXCEPT HIS WIFE  WHO  WE HAVE ASCERTAINED  WILL BE AMONG THOSE WHO WILL LAG BEHIND  SECTION  
   AT LENGTH WHEN THE MESSENGERS ARRIVED AMONG THE ADHERENTS OF LŪṬ 
   HE SAID     YE APPEAR TO BE UNCOMMON FOLK  
   THEY SAID     YEA  WE HAVE COME TO THEE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT OF WHICH THEY DOUBT 
     WE HAVE BROUGHT TO THEE THAT WHICH IS INEVITABLY DUE  AND ASSUREDLY WE TELL THE TRUTH 
     THEN TRAVEL BY NIGHT WITH THY HOUSEHOLD  WHEN A PORTION OF THE NIGHT  YET REMAINS   AND DO THOU BRING UP THE REAR   LET NO ONE AMONGST YOU LOOK BACK  BUT PASS ON WHITHER YE ARE ORDERED  
   AND WE MADE KNOWN THIS DECREE TO HIM  THAT THE LAST REMNANTS OF THOSE  SINNERS  SHOULD BE CUT OFF BY THE MORNING 
   THE INHABITANTS OF THE CITY CAME IN  MAD  JOY  AT NEWS OF THE YOUNG MEN  
   LŪṬ SAID     THESE ARE MY GUESTS   DISGRACE ME NOT  
     BUT FEAR GOD  AND SHAME ME NOT  
   THEY SAID     DID WE NOT FORBID THEE  TO SPEAK  FOR ALL AND SUNDRY    
   HE SAID     THERE ARE MY DAUGHTERS  TO MARRY   IF YE MUST ACT  SO   
   VERILY  BY THY LIFE  O PROPHET   IN THEIR WILD INTOXICATION  THEY WANDER IN DISTRACTION  TO AND FRO 
   BUT THE  MIGHTY  BLAST OVERTOOK THEM BEFORE MORNING 
   AND WE TURNED  THE CITIES  UPSIDE DOWN  AND RAINED DOWN ON THEM BRIMSTONES HARD AS BAKED CLAY 
   BEHOLD   IN THIS ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE WHO BY TOKENS DO UNDERSTAND 
   AND THE  CITIES WERE  RIGHT ON THE HIGH ROAD 
   BEHOLD   IN THIS IS A SIGN FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE  
   AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE WOOD WERE ALSO WRONG DOERS  
   SO WE EXACTED RETRIBUTION FROM THEM  THEY WERE BOTH ON AN OPEN HIGHWAY  PLAIN TO SEE SECTION  
   THE COMPANIONS OF THE ROCKY TRACT ALSO REJECTED THE APOSTLES  
   WE SENT THEM OUR SIGNS  BUT THEY PERSISTED IN TURNING AWAY FROM THEM 
   OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS DID THEY HEW  THEIR  EDIFICES   FEELING THEMSELVES  SECURE 
   BUT THE  MIGHTY  BLAST SEIZED THEM OF A MORNING 
   AND OF NO AVAIL TO THEM WAS ALL THAT THEY DID  WITH SUCH ART AND CARE   
   WE CREATED NOT THE HEAVENS  THE EARTH  AND ALL BETWEEN THEM  BUT FOR JUST ENDS  AND THE HOUR IS SURELY COMING  WHEN THIS WILL BE MANIFEST   SO OVERLOOK  ANY HUMAN FAULTS  WITH GRACIOUS FORGIVENESS 
   FOR VERILY IT IS THY LORD WHO IS THE MASTER CREATOR  KNOWING ALL THINGS 
   AND WE HAVE BESTOWED UPON THEE THE SEVEN OFT REPEATED  VERSES  AND THE GRAND QUR ĀN 
   STRAIN NOT THINE EYES  WISTFULLY  AT WHAT WE HAVE BESTOWED ON CERTAIN CLASSES OF THEM  NOR GRIEVE OVER THEM   BUT LOWER THY WING  IN GENTLENESS  TO THE BELIEVERS 
   AND SAY     I AM INDEED HE THAT WARNETH OPENLY AND WITHOUT AMBIGUITY   
    OF JUST SUCH WRATH  AS WE SENT DOWN ON THOSE WHO DIVIDED  SCRIPTURE INTO ARBITRARY PARTS   
    SO ALSO ON SUCH  AS HAVE MADE THE QUR ĀN INTO SHREDS  AS THEY PLEASE  
   THEREFORE  BY THY LORD  WE WILL  OF A SURETY  CALL THEM TO ACCOUNT 
   FOR ALL THEIR DEEDS 
   THEREFORE EXPOUND OPENLY WHAT THOU ART COMMANDED  AND TURN AWAY FROM THOSE WHO JOIN FALSE GODS WITH GOD 
   FOR SUFFICIENT ARE WE UNTO THEE AGAINST THOSE WHO SCOFF  
   THOSE WHO ADOPT  WITH GOD  ANOTHER GOD   BUT SOON WILL THEY COME TO KNOW 
   WE DO INDEED KNOW HOW THY HEART IS DISTRESSED AT WHAT THEY SAY 
   BUT CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF THY LORD  AND BE OF THOSE WHO PROSTRATE THEMSELVES IN ADORATION 
   AND SERVE THY LORD UNTIL THERE COME UNTO THEE THE HOUR THAT IS CERTAIN 
    INEVITABLE  COMETH  TO PASS  THE COMMAND OF GOD   SEEK YE NOT THEN TO HASTEN IT   GLORY TO HIM  AND FAR IS HE ABOVE HAVING THE PARTNERS THEY ASCRIBE UNTO HIM  
   HE DOTH SEND DOWN HIS ANGELS WITH INSPIRATION OF HIS COMMAND  TO SUCH OF HIS SERVANTS AS HE PLEASETH   SAYING      WARN  MAN  THAT THERE IS NO GOD BUT I   SO DO YOUR DUTY UNTO ME  
   HE HAS CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH FOR JUST ENDS   FAR IS HE ABOVE HAVING THE PARTNERS THEY ASCRIBE TO HIM  
   HE HAS CREATED MAN FROM A SPERM DROP   AND BEHOLD THIS SAME  MAN  BECOMES AN OPEN DISPUTER  
   AND CATTLE HE HAS CREATED FOR YOU  MEN    FROM THEM YE DERIVE WARMTH  AND NUMEROUS BENEFITS  AND OF THEIR  MEAT  YE EAT 
   AND YE HAVE A SENSE OF PRIDE AND BEAUTY IN THEM AS YE DRIVE THEM HOME IN THE EVENING  AND AS YE LEAD THEM FORTH TO PASTURE IN THE MORNING 
   AND THEY CARRY YOUR HEAVY LOADS TO LANDS THAT YE COULD NOT  OTHERWISE  REACH EXCEPT WITH SOULS DISTRESSED   FOR YOUR LORD IS INDEED MOST KIND  MOST MERCIFUL

   LET THEM BEAR  ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  THEIR OWN BURDENS IN FULL  AND ALSO  SOMETHING  OF THE BURDENS OF THOSE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE  WHOM THEY MISLED  ALAS  HOW GRIEVOUS THE BURDENS THEY WILL BEAR  SECTION  
   THOSE BEFORE THEM DID ALSO PLOT  AGAINST GOD S WAY    BUT GOD TOOK THEIR STRUCTURES FROM THEIR FOUNDATIONS  AND THE ROOF FELL DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE   AND THE WRATH SEIZED THEM FROM DIRECTIONS THEY DID NOT PERCEIVE 
   THEN  ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  HE WILL COVER THEM WITH SHAME  AND SAY     WHERE ARE MY   PARTNERS   CONCERNING WHOM YE USED TO DISPUTE  WITH THE GODLY      THOSE ENDUED WITH KNOWLEDGE WILL SAY     THIS DAY  INDEED  ARE THE UNBELIEVERS COVERED WITH SHAME AND MISERY

   DO THE  UNGODLY  WAIT UNTIL THE ANGELS COME TO THEM  OR THERE COMES THE COMMAND OF THY LORD  FOR THEIR DOOM    SO DID THOSE WHO WENT BEFORE THEM  BUT GOD WRONGED THEM NOT   NAY  THEY WRONGED THEIR OWN SOULS 
   BUT THE EVIL RESULTS OF THEIR DEEDS OVERTOOK THEM  AND THAT VERY  WRATH  AT WHICH THEY HAD SCOFFED HEMMED THEM IN SECTION  
   THE WORSHIPPERS OF FALSE GODS SAY     IF GOD HAD SO WILLED  WE SHOULD NOT HAVE WORSHIPPED AUGHT BUT HIM NEITHER WE NOR OUR FATHERS  NOR SHOULD WE HAVE PRESCRIBED PROHIBITIONS OTHER THAN HIS   SO DID THOSE WHO WENT BEFORE THEM  BUT WHAT IS THE MISSION OF APOSTLES BUT TO PREACH THE CLEAR MESSAGE  
   FOR WE ASSUREDLY SENT AMONGST EVERY PEOPLE AN APOSTLE   WITH THE COMMAND     SERVE GOD  AND ESCHEW EVIL     OF THE PEOPLE WERE SOME WHOM GOD GUIDED  AND SOME ON WHOM ERROR BECAME INEVITABLY  ESTABLISHED   SO TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH  AND SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE WHO DENIED  THE TRUTH  
   IF THOU ART ANXIOUS FOR THEIR GUIDANCE  YET GOD GUIDETH NOT SUCH AS HE LEAVES TO STRAY  AND THERE IS NONE TO HELP THEM 
   THEY SWEAR THEIR STRONGEST OATHS BY GOD  THAT GOD WILL NOT RAISE UP THOSE WHO DIE   NAY  BUT IT IS A PROMISE  BINDING  ON HIM IN TRUTH   BUT MOST AMONG MANKIND REALISE IT NOT 
    THEY MUST BE RAISED UP   IN ORDER THAT HE MAY MANIFEST TO THEM THE TRUTH OF THAT WHEREIN THEY DIFFER  AND THAT THE REJECTERS OF TRUTH MAY REALISE THAT THEY HAD INDEED  SURRENDERED TO  FALSEHOOD 
   FOR TO ANYTHING WHICH WE HAVE WILLED  WE BUT SAY THE WORD    BE    AND IT IS SECTION  
   TO THOSE WHO LEAVE THEIR HOMES IN THE CAUSE OF GOD  AFTER SUFFERING OPPRESSION   WE WILL ASSUREDLY GIVE A GOODLY HOME IN THIS WORLD   BUT TRULY THE REWARD OF THE HEREAFTER WILL BE GREATER  IF THEY ONLY REALISE  THIS   
    THEY ARE  THOSE WHO PERSEVERE IN PATIENCE  AND PUT THEIR TRUST ON THEIR LORD 
   AND BEFORE THEE ALSO THE APOSTLES WE SENT WERE BUT MEN  TO WHOM WE GRANTED INSPIRATION   IF YE REALISE THIS NOT  ASK OF THOSE WHO POSSESS THE MESSAGE 
    WE SENT THEM  WITH CLEAR SIGNS AND BOOKS OF DARK PROPHECIES   AND WE HAVE SENT DOWN UNTO THEE  ALSO  THE MESSAGE   THAT THOU MAYEST EXPLAIN CLEARLY TO MEN WHAT IS SENT FOR THEM  AND THAT THEY MAY GIVE THOUGHT 
   DO THEN THOSE WHO DEVISE EVIL  PLOTS  FEEL SECURE THAT GOD WILL NOT CAUSE THE EARTH TO SWALLOW THEM UP  OR THAT THE WRATH WILL NOT SEIZE THEM FROM DIRECTIONS THEY LITTLE PERCEIVE   
   OR THAT HE MAY NOT CALL THEM TO ACCOUNT IN THE MIDST OF THEIR GOINGS TO AND FRO  WITHOUT A CHANCE OF THEIR FRUSTRATING HIM  
   OR THAT HE MAY NOT CALL THEM TO ACCOUNT BY A PROCESS OF SLOW WASTAGE  FOR THY LORD IS INDEED FULL OF KINDNESS AND MERCY 
   DO THEY NOT LOOK AT GOD S CREATION   EVEN  AMONG  INANIMATE  THINGS   HOW THEIR  VERY  SHADOWS TURN ROUND  FROM THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT  PROSTRATING THEMSELVES TO GOD  AND THAT IN THE HUMBLEST MANNER  
   AND TO GOD DOTH OBEISANCE ALL THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  WHETHER MOVING  LIVING  CREATURES OR THE ANGELS   FOR NONE ARE ARROGANT  BEFORE THEIR LORD  
   THEY ALL REVERE THEIR LORD  HIGH ABOVE THEM  AND THEY DO ALL THAT THEY ARE COMMANDED SECTION  
   GOD HAS SAID     TAKE NOT  FOR WORSHIP  TWO GODS   FOR HE IS JUST ONE GOD   THEN FEAR ME  AND ME ALONE   
   TO HIM BELONGS WHATEVER IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  AND TO HIM IS DUTY DUE ALWAYS   THEN WILL YE FEAR OTHER THAN GOD  
   AND YE HAVE NO GOOD THING BUT IS FROM GOD   AND MOREOVER  WHEN YE ARE TOUCHED BY DISTRESS  UNTO HIM YE CRY WITH GROANS  
   YET  WHEN HE REMOVES THE DISTRESS FROM YOU  BEHOLD   SOME OF YOU TURN TO OTHER GODS TO JOIN WITH THEIR LORD 
    AS IF  TO SHOW THEIR INGRATITUDE FOR THE FAVOURS WE HAVE BESTOWED ON THEM   THEN ENJOY  YOUR BRIEF DAY    BUT SOON WILL YE KNOW  YOUR FOLLY   
   AND THEY  EVEN  ASSIGN  TO THINGS THEY DO NOT KNOW  A PORTION OUT OF THAT WHICH WE HAVE BESTOWED FOR THEIR SUSTENANCE   BY GOD  YE SHALL CERTAINLY BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR YOUR FALSE INVENTIONS 
   AND THEY ASSIGN DAUGHTERS FOR GOD   GLORY BE TO HIM    AND FOR THEMSELVES  SONS   THE ISSUE  THEY DESIRE  
   WHEN NEWS IS BROUGHT TO ONE OF THEM  OF  THE BIRTH OF  A FEMALE  CHILD   HIS FACE DARKENS  AND HE IS FILLED WITH INWARD GRIEF  
   WITH SHAME DOES HE HIDE HIMSELF FROM HIS PEOPLE  BECAUSE OF THE BAD NEWS HE HAS HAD   SHALL HE RETAIN IT ON  SUFFERANCE AND  CONTEMPT  OR BURY IT IN THE DUST   AH   WHAT AN EVIL  CHOICE  THEY DECIDE ON  
   TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT IN THE HEREAFTER  APPLIES THE SIMILITUDE OF EVIL   TO GOD APPLIES THE HIGHEST SIMILITUDE   FOR HE IS THE EXALTED IN POWER  FULL OF WISDOM SECTION  
   IF GOD WERE TO PUNISH MEN FOR THEIR WRONG DOING  HE WOULD NOT LEAVE  ON THE  EARTH   A SINGLE LIVING CREATURE   BUT HE GIVES THEM RESPITE FOR A STATED TERM   WHEN THEIR TERM EXPIRES  THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DELAY  THE PUNISHMENT  FOR A SINGLE HOUR  JUST AS THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE IT  FOR A SINGLE HOUR  
   THEY ATTRIBUTE TO GOD WHAT THEY HATE  FOR THEMSELVES   AND THEIR TONGUES ASSERT THE FALSEHOOD THAT ALL GOOD THINGS ARE FOR THEMSELVES   WITHOUT DOUBT FOR THEM IS THE FIRE  AND THEY WILL BE THE FIRST TO BE HASTENED ON INTO IT  
   BY GOD  WE  ALSO  SENT  OUR APOSTLES  TO PEOPLES BEFORE THEE   BUT SATAN MADE   TO THE WICKED   THEIR OWN ACTS SEEM ALLURING   HE IS ALSO THEIR PATRON TO DAY  BUT THEY SHALL HAVE A MOST GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   AND WE SENT DOWN THE BOOK TO THEE FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE  THAT THOU SHOULDST MAKE CLEAR TO THEM THOSE THINGS IN WHICH THEY DIFFER  AND THAT IT SHOULD BE A GUIDE AND A MERCY TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE

   THEN TO EAT OF ALL THE PRODUCE  OF THE EARTH   AND FIND WITH SKILL THE SPACIOUS PATHS OF ITS LORD   THERE ISSUES FROM WITHIN THEIR BODIES A DRINK OF VARYING COLOURS  WHEREIN IS HEALING FOR MEN   VERILY IN THIS IS A SIGN FOR THOSE WHO GIVE THOUGHT 
   IT IS GOD WHO CREATES YOU AND TAKES YOUR SOULS AT DEATH   AND OF YOU THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE SENT BACK TO A FEEBLE AGE  SO THAT THEY KNOW NOTHING AFTER HAVING KNOWN  MUCH    FOR GOD IS ALL KNOWING  ALL POWERFUL SECTION  
   GOD HAS BESTOWED HIS GIFTS OF SUSTENANCE MORE FREELY ON SOME OF YOU THAN ON OTHERS   THOSE MORE FAVOURED ARE NOT GOING TO THROW BACK THEIR GIFTS TO THOSE WHOM THEIR RIGHT HANDS POSSESS  SO AS TO BE EQUAL IN THAT RESPECT  WILL THEY THEN DENY THE FAVOURS OF GOD  
   AND GOD HAS MADE FOR YOU MATES  AND COMPANIONS  OF YOUR OWN NATURE  AND MADE FOR YOU  OUT OF THEM  SONS AND DAUGHTERS AND GRANDCHILDREN  AND PROVIDED FOR YOU SUSTENANCE OF THE BEST   WILL THEY THEN BELIEVE IN VAIN THINGS  AND BE UNGRATEFUL FOR GOD S FAVOURS   
   AND WORSHIP OTHERS THAN GOD   SUCH AS HAVE NO POWER OF PROVIDING THEM  FOR SUSTENANCE  WITH ANYTHING IN HEAVENS OR EARTH  AND CANNOT POSSIBLY HAVE SUCH POWER  
   INVENT NOT SIMILITUDES FOR GOD   FOR GOD KNOWETH  AND YE KNOW NOT 
   GOD SETS FORTH THE PARABLE  OF TWO MEN   ONE  A SLAVE UNDER THE DOMINION OF ANOTHER   HE HAS NO POWER OF ANY SORT   AND  THE OTHER  A MAN ON WHOM WE HAVE BESTOWED GOODLY FAVOURS FROM OURSELVES  AND HE SPENDS THEREOF  FREELY   PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY   ARE THE TWO EQUAL    BY NO MEANS &SEMI   PRAISE BE TO GOD  BUT MOST OF THEM UNDERSTAND NOT 
   GOD SETS FORTH  ANOTHER  PARABLE OF TWO MEN   ONE OF THEM DUMB  WITH NO POWER OF ANY SORT   A WEARISOME BURDEN IS HE TO HIS MASTER   WHICHEVER WAY HE DIRECTS HIM  HE BRINGS NO GOOD   IS SUCH A MAN EQUAL WITH ONE WHO COMMANDS JUSTICE  AND IS ON A STRAIGHT WAY  SECTION  
   TO GOD BELONGETH THE MYSTERY OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND THE DECISION OF THE HOUR  OF JUDGMENT  IS AS THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE  OR EVEN QUICKER   FOR GOD HATH POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   IT IS HE WHO BROUGHT YOU FORTH FROM THE WOMBS OF YOUR MOTHERS WHEN YE KNEW NOTHING   AND HE GAVE YOU HEARING AND SIGHT AND INTELLIGENCE AND AFFECTIONS   THAT YE MAY GIVE THANKS  TO GOD  
   DO THEY NOT LOOK AT THE BIRDS  HELD POISED IN THE MIDST OF  THE AIR AND  THE SKY   NOTHING HOLDS THEM UP BUT  THE POWER OF  GOD  VERILY IN THIS ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE

   BUT IF THEY TURN AWAY  THY DUTY IS ONLY TO PREACH THE CLEAR MESSAGE 
   THEY RECOGNISE THE FAVOURS OF GOD   THEN THEY DENY THEM   AND MOST OF THEM ARE  CREATURES  UNGRATEFUL SECTION  
   ONE DAY WE SHALL RAISE FROM ALL PEOPLES A WITNESS   THEN WILL NO EXCUSE BE ACCEPTED FROM UNBELIEVERS  NOR WILL THEY RECEIVE ANY FAVOURS 
   WHEN THE WRONG DOERS  ACTUALLY  SEE THE PENALTY  THEN WILL IT IN NO WAY BE MITIGATED  NOR WILL THEY THEN RECEIVE RESPITE 
   WHEN THOSE WHO GAVE PARTNERS TO GOD WILL SEE THEIR   PARTNERS    THEY WILL SAY     OUR LORD   THESE ARE OUR   PARTNERS   THOSE WHOM WE USED TO INVOKE BESIDES THEE   BUT THEY WILL THROW BACK THEIR WORD AT THEM  AND SAY      INDEED YE ARE LIARS    
   THAT DAY SHALL THEY  OPENLY  SHOW  THEIR  SUBMISSION TO GOD   AND ALL THEIR INVENTIONS SHALL LEAVE THEM IN THE LURCH

   GOD COMMANDS JUSTICE  THE DOING OF GOOD  AND LIBERALITY TO KITH AND KIN  AND HE FORBIDS ALL SHAMEFUL DEEDS  AND INJUSTICE AND REBELLION   HE INSTRUCTS YOU  THAT YE MAY RECEIVE ADMONITION 
   FULFIL THE COVENANT OF GOD WHEN YE HAVE ENTERED INTO IT  AND BREAK NOT YOUR OATHS   YE HAVE CONFIRMED THEM   INDEED YE HAVE MADE GOD YOUR SURETY   FOR GOD KNOWETH ALL THAT YE DO 
   AND BE NOT LIKE A WOMAN WHO BREAKS INTO UNTWISTED STRANDS THE YARN WHICH SHE HAS SPUN  AFTER IT HAS BECOME STRONG  NOR TAKE YOUR OATHS TO PRACTISE DECEPTION BETWEEN YOURSELVES  LEST ONE PARTY SHOULD BE MORE NUMEROUS THAN ANOTHER   FOR GOD WILL TEST YOU BY THIS   AND ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT HE WILL CERTAINLY MAKE CLEAR TO YOU  THE TRUTH OF  THAT WHEREIN YE DISAGREE 
   IF GOD SO WILLED  HE COULD MAKE YOU ALL ONE PEOPLE   BUT HE LEAVES STRAYING WHOM HE PLEASES  AND HE GUIDES WHOM HE PLEASES   BUT YE SHALL CERTAINLY BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL YOUR ACTIONS 
   AND TAKE NOT YOUR OATHS  TO PRACTICE DECEPTION BETWEEN YOURSELVES  WITH THE RESULT THAT SOMEONE S FOOT MAY SLIP AFTER IT WAS FIRMLY PLANTED  AND YE MAY HAVE TO TASTE THE EVIL  CONSEQUENCES  OF HAVING HINDERED  MEN  FROM THE PATH OF GOD  AND A MIGHTY WRATH DESCEND ON YOU 
   NOR SELL THE COVENANT OF GOD FOR A MISERABLE PRICE   FOR WITH GOD IS  A PRIZE  FAR BETTER FOR YOU  IF YE ONLY KNEW

   WHEN THOU DOST READ THE QUR ĀN  SEEK GOD S PROTECTION FROM SATAN THE REJECTED ONE 
   NO AUTHORITY HAS HE OVER THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND PUT THEIR TRUST IN THEIR LORD 
   HIS AUTHORITY IS OVER THOSE ONLY  WHO TAKE HIM AS PATRON AND WHO JOIN PARTNERS WITH GOD SECTION  
   WHEN WE SUBSTITUTE ONE REVELATION FOR ANOTHER  AND GOD KNOWS BEST WHAT HE REVEALS  IN STAGES    THEY SAY    THOU ART BUT A FORGER     BUT MOST OF THEM UNDERSTAND NOT 
   SAY  THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS BROUGHT THE REVELATION FROM THY LORD IN TRUTH  IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THOSE WHO BELIEVE  AND AS A GUIDE AND GLAD TIDINGS TO MUSLIMS 
   WE KNOW INDEED THAT THEY SAY    IT IS A MAN THAT TEACHES HIM   THE TONGUE OF HIM THEY WICKEDLY POINT TO IS NOTABLE FOREIGN  WHILE THIS IS ARABIC  PURE AND CLEAR

   THIS BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD BETTER THAN THE HEREAFTER   AND GOD WILL NOT GUIDE THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH

   WITHOUT DOUBT  IN THE HEREAFTER THEY WILL PERISH 
   BUT VERILY THY LORD   TO THOSE WHO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AFTER TRIALS AND PERSECUTIONS   AND WHO THEREAFTER STRIVE AND FIGHT FOR THE FAITH AND PATIENTLY PERSEVERE   THY LORD  AFTER ALL THIS IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL SECTION  
   ONE DAY EVERY SOUL WILL COME UP STRUGGLING FOR ITSELF  AND EVERY SOUL WILL BE RECOMPENSED  FULLY  FOR ALL ITS ACTIONS  AND NONE WILL BE UNJUSTLY DEALT WITH 
   GOD SETS FORTH A PARABLE   A CITY ENJOYING SECURITY AND QUIET  ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED WITH SUSTENANCE FROM EVERY PLACE   YET WAS IT UNGRATEFUL FOR THE FAVOURS OF GOD   SO GOD MADE IT TASTE OF HUNGER AND TERROR  IN EXTREMES   CLOSING IN ON IT  LIKE A GARMENT  FROM EVERY SIDE   BECAUSE OF THE  EVIL  WHICH  ITS PEOPLE  WROUGHT 
   AND THERE CAME TO THEM AN APOSTLE FROM AMONG THEMSELVES  BUT THEY FALSELY REJECTED HIM   SO THE WRATH SEIZED THEM EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THEIR INIQUITIES 
   SO EAT OF THE SUSTENANCE WHICH GOD HAS PROVIDED FOR YOU  LAWFUL AND GOOD   AND BE GRATEFUL FOR THE FAVOURS OF GOD  IF IT IS HE WHOM YE SERVE 
   HE HAS ONLY FORBIDDEN YOU DEAD MEAT  AND BLOOD  AND THE FLESH OF SWINE  AND ANY  FOOD  OVER WHICH THE NAME OF OTHER THAN GOD HAS BEEN INVOKED  BUT IF ONE IS FORCED BY NECESSITY  WITHOUT WILFUL DISOBEDIENCE  NOR TRANSGRESSING DUE LIMITS   THEN GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   BUT SAY NOT FOR ANY FALSE THING THAT YOUR TONGUES MAY PUT FORTH     THIS IS LAWFUL  AND THIS IS FORBIDDEN   SO AS TO ASCRIBE FALSE THINGS TO GOD  FOR THOSE WHO ASCRIBE FALSE THINGS TO GOD  WILL NEVER PROSPER 
    IN SUCH FALSEHOOD  IS BUT A PALTRY PROFIT   BUT THEY WILL HAVE A MOST GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   TO THE JEWS WE PROHIBITED SUCH THINGS AS WE HAVE MENTIONED TO THEE BEFORE   WE DID THEM NO WRONG  BUT THEY WERE USED TO DOING WRONG TO THEMSELVES

   ABRAHAM WAS INDEED A MODEL  DEVOUTLY OBEDIENT TO GOD   AND  TRUE IN FAITH  AND HE JOINED NOT GODS WITH GOD  
   HE SHOWED HIS GRATITUDE FOR THE FAVOURS OF GOD  WHO CHOSE HIM  AND GUIDED HIM TO A STRAIGHT WAY 
   AND WE GAVE HIM GOOD IN THIS WORLD  AND HE WILL BE  IN THE HEREAFTER  IN THE RANKS OF THE RIGHTEOUS 
   SO WE HAVE TAUGHT THEE THE INSPIRED  MESSAGE     FOLLOW THE WAYS OF ABRAHAM THE TRUE IN FAITH  AND HE JOINED NOT GODS WITH GOD  
   THE SABBATH WAS ONLY MADE  STRICT  TO THOSE WHO DISAGREED  AS TO ITS OBSERVANCE    BUT GOD WILL JUDGE BETWEEN THEM ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  AS TO THEIR DIFFERENCES 
   INVITE  ALL  TO THE WAY OF THY LORD WITH WISDOM AND BEAUTIFUL PREACHING   AND ARGUE WITH THEM IN WAYS THAT ARE BEST AND MOST GRACIOUS   FOR THY LORD KNOWETH BEST  WHO HAVE STRAYED FROM HIS PATH  AND WHO RECEIVE GUIDANCE 
   AND IF YE DO CATCH THEM OUT  CATCH THEM OUT NO WORSE THAN THEY CATCH YOU OUT   BUT IF YE SHOW PATIENCE  THAT IS INDEED THE BEST  COURSE  FOR THOSE WHO ARE PATIENT 
   AND DO THOU BE PATIENT  FOR THY PATIENCE IS BUT FROM GOD   NOR GRIEVE OVER THEM   AND DISTRESS NOT THYSELF BECAUSE OF THEIR PLOTS 
   FOR GOD IS WITH THOSE WHO RESTRAIN THEMSELVES  AND THOSE WHO DO GOOD 
   GLORY TO  GOD  WHO DID TAKE HIS SERVANT FOR A JOURNEY BY NIGHT FROM THE SACRED MOSQUE TO THE FARTHEST MOSQUE  WHOSE PRECINCTS WE DID BLESS  IN ORDER THAT WE MIGHT SHOW HIM SOME OF OUR SIGNS   FOR HE IS THE ONE WHO HEARETH AND SEETH  ALL THINGS  
   WE GAVE MOSES THE BOOK  AND MADE IT A GUIDE TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL   COMMANDING      TAKE NOT OTHER THAN ME AS DISPOSER OF  YOUR  AFFAIRS  
   O YE THAT ARE SPRUNG FROM THOSE WHOM WE CARRIED  IN THE ARK  WITH NOAH   VERILY HE WAS A DEVOTEE MOST GRATEFUL 
   AND WE GAVE  CLEAR  WARNING TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL IN THE BOOK  THAT TWICE WOULD THEY DO MISCHIEF ON THE EARTH AND BE ELATED WITH MIGHTY ARROGANCE  AND TWICE WOULD THEY BE PUNISHED   
   WHEN THE FIRST OF THE WARNINGS CAME TO PASS  WE SENT AGAINST YOU OUR SERVANTS GIVEN TO TERRIBLE WARFARE   THEY ENTERED THE VERY INMOST PARTS OF YOUR HOMES   AND IT WAS A WARNING  COMPLETELY  FULFILLED 
   THEN DID WE GRANT YOU THE RETURN AS AGAINST THEM   WE GAVE YOU INCREASE IN RESOURCES AND SONS  AND MADE YOU THE MORE NUMEROUS IN MAN POWER 
   IF YE DID WELL  YE DID WELL FOR YOURSELVES   IF YE DID EVIL   YE DID IT  AGAINST YOURSELVES  SO WHEN THE SECOND OF THE WARNINGS CAME TO PASS   WE PERMITTED YOUR ENEMIES  TO DISFIGURE YOUR FACES  AND TO ENTER YOUR TEMPLE AS THEY HAD ENTERED IT BEFORE  AND TO VISIT WITH DESTRUCTION ALL THAT FELL INTO THEIR POWER 
   IT MAY BE THAT YOUR LORD MAY  YET  SHOW MERCY UNTO YOU   BUT IF YE REVERT  TO YOUR SINS   WE SHALL REVERT  TO OUR PUNISHMENTS    AND WE HAVE MADE HELL A PRISON FOR THOSE WHO REJECT  ALL FAITH  
   VERILY THIS QUR ĀN DOTH GUIDE TO THAT WHICH IS MOST RIGHT  OR STABLE   AND GIVETH THE GLAD TIDINGS TO THE BELIEVERS WHO WORK DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  THAT THEY SHALL HAVE A MAGNIFICENT REWARD  
   AND TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT IN THE HEREAFTER   IT ANNOUNCETH  THAT WE HAVE PREPARED FOR THEM A PENALTY GRIEVOUS  INDEED  SECTION  
   THE PRAYER THAT MAN SHOULD MAKE FOR GOOD  HE MAKETH FOR EVIL   FOR MAN IS GIVEN TO HASTY  DEEDS  
   WE HAVE MADE THE NIGHT AND THE DAY AS TWO  OF OUR  SIGNS   THE SIGN OF THE NIGHT HAVE WE OBSCURED  WHILE THE SIGN OF THE DAY WE HAVE MADE TO ENLIGHTEN YOU   THAT YE MAY SEEK BOUNTY FROM YOUR LORD  AND THAT YE MAY KNOW THE NUMBER AND COUNT OF THE YEARS   ALL THINGS HAVE WE EXPLAINED IN DETAIL 
   EVERY MAN S FATE WE HAVE FASTENED ON HIS OWN NECK   ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT WE SHALL BRING OUT FOR HIM A SCROLL  WHICH HE WILL SEE SPREAD OPEN 
    IT WILL BE SAID TO HIM &COLON     READ THINE  OWN  RECORD   SUFFICIENT IS THY SOUL THIS DAY TO MAKE OUT AN ACCOUNT AGAINST THEE  
   WHO RECEIVETH GUIDANCE  RECEIVETH IT FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT   WHO GOETH ASTRAY DOTH SO TO HIS OWN LOSS   NO BEARER OF BURDENS CAN BEAR THE BURDEN OF ANOTHER   NOR WOULD WE VISIT WITH OUR WRATH UNTIL WE HAD SENT AN APOSTLE  TO GIVE WARNING  
   WHEN WE DECIDE TO DESTROY A POPULATION  WE  FIRST  SEND A DEFINITE ORDER TO THOSE AMONG THEM WHO ARE GIVEN THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS LIFE AND YET TRANSGRESS   SO THAT THE WORD IS PROVED TRUE AGAINST THEM   THEN  IT IS  WE DESTROY THEM UTTERLY 
   HOW MANY GENERATIONS HAVE WE DESTROYED AFTER NOAH   AND ENOUGH IS THY LORD TO NOTE AND SEE THE SINS OF HIS SERVANTS 
   IF ANY DO WISH FOR THE TRANSITORY THINGS  OF THIS LIFE   WE READILY GRANT THEM SUCH THINGS AS WE WILL  TO SUCH PERSONS AS WE WILL   IN THE END HAVE WE PROVIDED HELL FOR THEM   THEY WILL BURN THEREIN  DISGRACED AND REJECTED 
   THOSE WHO DO WISH FOR THE  THINGS OF  THE HEREAFTER  AND STRIVE THEREFOR WITH ALL DUE STRIVING  AND HAVE FAITH   THEY ARE THE ONES WHOSE STRIVING IS ACCEPTABLE  TO GOD  
   OF THE BOUNTIES OF THY LORD WE BESTOW FREELY ON ALL  THESE AS WELL AS THOSE   THE BOUNTIES OF THY LORD ARE NOT CLOSED  TO ANYONE  
   SEE HOW WE HAVE BESTOWED MORE ON SOME THAN ON OTHERS   BUT VERILY THE HEREAFTER IS MORE IN RANK AND GRADATION AND MORE IN EXCELLENCE 
   TAKE NOT WITH GOD ANOTHER OBJECT OF WORSHIP   OR THOU  O MAN    WILT SIT IN DISGRACE AND DESTITUTION SECTION  
   THY LORD HATH DECREED THAT YE WORSHIP NONE BUT HIM  AND THAT YE BE KIND TO PARENTS  WHETHER ONE OR BOTH OF THEM ATTAIN OLD AGE IN THY LIFE  SAY NOT TO THEM A WORD OF CONTEMPT  NOR REPEL THEM  BUT ADDRESS THEM IN TERMS OF HONOUR 
   AND  OUT OF KINDNESS  LOWER TO THEM THE WING OF HUMILITY  AND SAY     MY LORD   BESTOW ON THEM THY MERCY EVEN AS THEY CHERISHED ME IN CHILDHOOD  
   YOUR LORD KNOWETH BEST WHAT IS IN YOUR HEARTS   IF YE DO DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  VERILY HE IS MOST FORGIVING TO THOSE WHO TURN TO HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN  IN TRUE PENITENCE  
   AND RENDER TO THE KINDRED THEIR DUE RIGHTS  AS  ALSO  TO THOSE IN WANT  AND TO THE WAYFARER   BUT SQUANDER NOT  YOUR WEALTH  IN THE MANNER OF A SPENDTHRIFT 
   VERILY SPENDTHRIFTS ARE BROTHERS OF THE EVIL ONES   AND THE EVIL ONE IS TO HIS LORD  HIMSELF  UNGRATEFUL 
   AND EVEN IF THOU HAST TO TURN AWAY FROM THEM IN PURSUIT OF THE MERCY FROM THY LORD WHICH THOU DOST EXPECT  YET SPEAK TO THEM A WORD OF EASY KINDNESS 
   MAKE NOT THY HAND TIED  LIKE A NIGGARD S  TO THY NECK  NOR STRETCH IT FORTH TO ITS UTMOST REACH  SO THAT THOU BECOME BLAMEWORTHY AND DESTITUTE

   NOR TAKE LIFE WHICH GOD HAS MADE SACRED EXCEPT FOR JUST CAUSE  AND IF ANYONE IS SLAIN WRONGFULLY  WE HAVE GIVEN HIS HEIR AUTHORITY  TO DEMAND QIṢĀṢ OR TO FORGIVE    BUT LET HIM NOT EXCEED BOUNDS IN THE MATTER OF TAKING LIFE   FOR HE IS HELPED  BY THE LAW  
   COME NOT NIGH TO THE ORPHAN S PROPERTY EXCEPT TO IMPROVE IT  UNTIL HE ATTAINS THE AGE OF FULL STRENGTH   AND FULFIL  EVERY  ENGAGEMENT  FOR  EVERY  ENGAGEMENT WILL BE ENQUIRED INTO  ON THE DAY OF RECKONING  
   GIVE FULL MEASURE WHEN YE MEASURE  AND WEIGH WITH A BALANCE THAT IS STRAIGHT   THAT IS THE MOST FITTING AND THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS IN THE FINAL DETERMINATION

   NOR WALK ON THE EARTH WITH INSOLENCE   FOR THOU CANST NOT REND THE EARTH ASUNDER  NOR REACH THE MOUNTAINS IN HEIGHT 
   OF ALL SUCH THINGS THE EVIL IS HATEFUL IN THE SIGHT OF THY LORD 
   THESE ARE AMONG THE  PRECEPTS OF  WISDOM  WHICH THY LORD HAS REVEALED TO THEE  TAKE NOT  WITH GOD  ANOTHER OBJECT OF WORSHIP  LEST THOU SHOULDST BE THROWN INTO HELL  BLAMEWORTHY AND REJECTED 
   HAS THEN YOUR LORD   O PAGANS    PREFERRED FOR YOU SONS  AND TAKEN FOR HIMSELF DAUGHTERS AMONG THE ANGELS   TRULY YE UTTER A MOST DREADFUL SAYING  SECTION  
   WE HAVE EXPLAINED  THINGS  IN VARIOUS  WAYS  IN THIS QUR ĀN  IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY RECEIVE ADMONITION  BUT IT ONLY INCREASES THEIR FLIGHT  FROM THE TRUTH   
   SAY   IF THERE HAD BEEN  OTHER  GODS WITH HIM   AS THEY SAY  BEHOLD  THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SOUGHT OUT A WAY TO THE LORD OF THE THRONE  
   GLORY TO HIM   HE IS HIGH ABOVE ALL THAT THEY SAY    EXALTED AND GREAT  BEYOND MEASURE   
   THE SEVEN HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND ALL BEINGS THEREIN  DECLARE HIS GLORY   THERE NOT A THING BUT CELEBRATES HIS PRAISE   AND YET YE UNDERSTAND NOT HOW THEY DECLARE HIS GLORY   VERILY HE IS OFT FORBEARING  MOST FORGIVING  
   WHEN THOU DOST RECITE THE QUR ĀN  WE PUT  BETWEEN THEE AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT IN THE HEREAFTER  A VEIL INVISIBLE  
   AND WE PUT COVERINGS OVER THEIR HEARTS  AND MINDS  LEST THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE QUR ĀN  AND DEAFNESS INTO THEIR EARS   WHEN THOU DOST COMMEMORATE THY LORD  AND HIM ALONE IN THE QUR ĀN  THEY TURN ON THEIR BACKS  FLEEING  FROM THE TRUTH  
   WE KNOW BEST WHY IT IS THEY LISTEN  WHEN THEY LISTEN TO THEE   AND WHEN THEY MEET IN PRIVATE CONFERENCE  BEHOLD  THE WICKED SAY    YE FOLLOW NONE OTHER THAN A MAN BEWITCHED    
   SEE WHAT SIMILES THY STRIKE FOR THEE   BUT THEY HAVE GONE ASTRAY  AND NEVER CAN THEY FIND A WAY 
   THEY SAY     WHAT   WHEN WE ARE REDUCED TO BONES AND DUST  SHOULD WE REALLY BE RAISED UP  TO BE  A NEW CREATION    
   SAY      NAY    BE YE STONES OR IRON 
     OR CREATED MATTER WHICH  IN YOUR MINDS  IS HARDEST  TO BE RAISED UP     YET SHALL YE BE RAISED UP      THEN WILL THEY SAY     WHO WILL CAUSE US TO RETURN     SAY     HE WHO CREATED YOU FIRST     THEN WILL THEY WAG THEIR HEADS TOWARDS THEE  AND SAY    WHEN WILL THAT BE     SAY    MAY BE IT WILL BE QUITE SOON  
     IT WILL BE ON A DAY WHEN HE WILL CALL YOU  AND YE WILL ANSWER  HIS CALL  WITH  WORDS OF  HIS PRAISE  AND YE WILL THINK THAT YE TARRIED BUT A LITTLE WHILE    SECTION  
   SAY TO MY SERVANTS THAT THEY SHOULD  ONLY  SAY THOSE THINGS THAT ARE BEST   FOR SATAN DOTH SOW DISSENSIONS AMONG THEM   FOR SATAN IS TO MAN AN AVOWED ENEMY 
   IT IS YOUR LORD THAT KNOWETH YOU BEST   IF HE PLEASE  HE GRANTETH YOU MERCY  OR IF HE PLEASE  PUNISHMENT   WE HAVE NOT SENT THEE TO BE A DISPOSER OF THEIR AFFAIRS FOR THEM 
   AND IT IS YOUR LORD THAT KNOWETH BEST ALL BEINGS THAT ARE IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   WE DID BESTOW ON SOME PROPHETS MORE  AND OTHER  GIFTS THAN ON OTHERS   AND WE GAVE TO DAVID  THE GIFT OF  THE PSALMS 
   SAY     CALL ON THOSE  BESIDES HIM WHOM YE FANCY   THEY HAVE NEITHER THE POWER TO REMOVE YOUR TROUBLES FROM YOU NOR TO CHANGE THEM  
   THOSE WHOM THEY CALL UPON DO DESIRE  FOR THEMSELVES  MEANS OF ACCESS TO THEIR LORD   EVEN THOSE WHO ARE NEAREST   THEY HOPE FOR HIS MERCY AND FEAR HIS WRATH   FOR THE WRATH OF THY LORD IS SOMETHING TO TAKE HEED OF 
   THERE IS NOT A POPULATION BUT WE SHALL DESTROY IT BEFORE THE DAY OF JUDGMENT OR PUNISH IT WITH A DREADFUL PENALTY   THAT IS WRITTEN IN THE  ETERNAL  RECORD 
   AND WE REFRAIN FROM SENDING THE SIGNS  ONLY BECAUSE THE MEN OF FORMER GENERATIONS TREATED THEM AS FALSE   WE SENT THE SHE CAMEL TO THE THAMŪD TO OPEN THEIR EYES  BUT THEY TREATED HER WRONGFULLY   WE ONLY SEND THE SIGNS BY WAY OF TERROR  AND WARNING FROM EVIL  
   BEHOLD   WE TOLD THEE THAT THY LORD DOTH ENCOMPASS MANKIND ROUND ABOUT   WE GRANTED THE VISION WHICH WE SHOWED THEE  BUT AS A TRIAL FOR MEN   AS ALSO THE CURSED TREE  MENTIONED  IN THE QUR ĀN   WE PUT TERROR  AND WARNING  INTO THEM  BUT IT ONLY INCREASES THEIR INORDINATE TRANSGRESSION  SECTION  
   BEHOLD   WE SAID TO THE ANGELS     BOW DOWN UNTO ADAM     THEY BOWED DOWN EXCEPT IBLĪS   HE SAID    SHALL I BOW DOWN TO ONE WHOM THOU DIDST CREATE FROM CLAY    
   HE SAID    SEEST THOU   THIS IS THE ONE WHOM THOU HAST HONOURED ABOVE ME   IF THOU WILT BUT RESPITE ME TO THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  I WILL SURELY BRING HIS DESCENDANTS UNDER MY SWAY  ALL BUT A FEW    
    GOD  SAID     GO THY WAY   IF ANY OF THEM FOLLOW THEE  VERILY HELL WILL BE THE RECOMPENSE OF YOU  ALL   AN AMPLE RECOMPENSE 
     LEAD TO DESTRUCTION THOSE WHOM THOU CANST AMONG THEM  WITH THY  SEDUCTIVE  VOICE   MAKE ASSAULTS ON THEM WITH THY CAVALRY AND THY INFANTRY   MUTUALLY SHARE WITH THEM WEALTH AND CHILDREN   AND MAKE PROMISES TO THEM   BUT SATAN PROMISES THEM NOTHING BUT DECEIT 
     AS FOR MY SERVANTS  NO AUTHORITY SHALT THOU HAVE OVER THEM     ENOUGH IS THY LORD FOR A DISPOSER OF AFFAIRS 
   YOUR LORD IS HE THAT MAKETH THE SHIP GO SMOOTHLY FOR YOU THROUGH THE SEA  IN ORDER THAT YE MAY SEEK OF HIS BOUNTY  FOR HE IS UNTO YOU MOST MERCIFUL 
   WHEN DISTRESS SEIZES YOU AT SEA  THOSE THAT YE CALL UPON BESIDES HIMSELF  LEAVE YOU IN THE LURCH   BUT WHEN HE BRINGS YOU BACK SAFE TO LAND  YE TURN AWAY  FROM HIM   MOST UNGRATEFUL IS MAN  
   DO YE THEN FEEL SECURE THAT HE WILL NOT CAUSE YOU TO BE SWALLOWED UP BENEATH THE EARTH WHEN YE ARE ON LAND  OR THAT HE WILL NOT SEND AGAINST YOU A VIOLENT TORNADO  WITH SHOWERS OF STONES  SO THAT YE SHALL FIND NO ONE TO CARRY OUT YOUR AFFAIRS FOR YOU  
   OR DO YE FEEL SECURE THAT HE WILL NOT SEND YOU BACK A SECOND TIME TO SEA AND SEND AGAINST YOU A HEAVY GALE TO DROWN YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR INGRATITUDE  SO THAT YE FIND NO HELPER THEREIN AGAINST US  
   WE HAVE HONOURED THE SONS OF ADAM   PROVIDED THEM WITH TRANSPORT ON LAND AND SEA   GIVEN THEM FOR SUSTENANCE THINGS GOOD AND PURE   AND CONFERRED ON THEM SPECIAL FAVOURS  ABOVE A GREAT PART OF OUR CREATION SECTION  
   ONE DAY WE SHALL CALL TOGETHER ALL HUMAN BEINGS WITH THEIR  RESPECTIVE  IMĀMS   THOSE WHO ARE GIVEN THEIR RECORD IN THEIR RIGHT HAND WILL READ IT  WITH PLEASURE   AND THEY WILL NOT BE DEALT WITH UNJUSTLY IN THE LEAST 
   BUT THOSE WHO WERE BLIND IN THIS WORLD  WILL BE BLIND IN THE HEREAFTER  AND MOST ASTRAY FROM THE PATH 
   AND THEIR PURPOSE WAS TO TEMPT THEE AWAY FROM THAT WHICH WE HAD REVEALED UNTO THEE  TO SUBSTITUTE IN OUR NAME SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT    IN THAT CASE   BEHOLD   THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE MADE THEE  THEIR  FRIEND  
   AND HAD WE NOT GIVEN THEE STRENGTH  THOU WOULDST NEARLY HAVE INCLINED TO THEM A LITTLE 
   IN THAT CASE WE SHOULD HAVE MADE THEE TASTE AN EQUAL PORTION  OF PUNISHMENT  IN THIS LIFE  AND AN EQUAL PORTION IN DEATH   AND MOREOVER THOU WOULDST HAVE FOUND NONE TO HELP THEE AGAINST US  
   THEIR PURPOSE WAS TO SCARE THEE OFF THE LAND  IN ORDER TO EXPEL THEE   BUT IN THAT CASE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE STAYED  THEREIN  AFTER THEE  EXCEPT FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
    THIS WAS OUR  WAY WITH THE APOSTLES WE SENT BEFORE THEE   THOU WILT FIND NO CHANGE IN OUR WAYS SECTION  
   ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS  AT THE SUN S DECLINE TILL THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT  AND THE MORNING PRAYER AND READING   FOR THE PRAYER AND READING IN THE MORNING CARRY THEIR TESTIMONY 
   AND PRAY IN THE SMALL WATCHES OF THE MORNING    IT WOULD BE  AN ADDITIONAL PRAYER  OR SPIRITUAL PROFIT  FOR THEE   SOON WILL THY LORD RAISE THEE TO A STATION OF PRAISE AND GLORY  
   SAY     O MY LORD   LET MY ENTRY BE BY THE GATE OF TRUTH AND HONOUR  AND LIKEWISE MY EXIT BY THE GATE OF TRUTH AND HONOUR   AND GRANT ME FROM THY PRESENCE AN AUTHORITY TO AID  ME   
   AND SAY     TRUTH HAS  NOW  ARRIVED  AND FALSEHOOD PERISHED   FOR FALSEHOOD IS  BY ITS NATURE  BOUND TO PERISH  
   WE SEND DOWN  STAGE BY STAGE  IN THE QUR ĀN THAT WHICH IS A HEALING AND A MERCY TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE   TO THE UNJUST IT CAUSES NOTHING BUT LOSS AFTER LOSS 
   YET WHEN WE BESTOW OUR FAVOURS ON MAN  HE TURNS AWAY AND BECOMES REMOTE ON HIS SIDE  INSTEAD OF COMING TO US   AND WHEN EVIL SEIZES HIM HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO DESPAIR  
   SAY     EVERYONE ACTS ACCORDING TO HIS OWN DISPOSITION   BUT YOUR LORD KNOWS BEST WHO IT IS THAT IS BEST GUIDED ON THE WAY  SECTION  
   THEY ASK THEE CONCERNING THE SPIRIT  OF INSPIRATION   SAY     THE SPIRIT  COMETH  BY COMMAND OF MY LORD   OF KNOWLEDGE IT IS ONLY A LITTLE THAT IS COMMUNICATED TO YOU   O MEN     
   IF IT WERE OUR WILL  WE COULD TAKE AWAY THAT WHICH WE HAVE SENT THEE BY INSPIRATION   THEN WOULD THOU FIND NONE TO PLEAD THY AFFAIR IN THAT MATTER AS AGAINST US  
   EXCEPT FOR MERCY FROM THY LORD   FOR HIS BOUNTY IS TO THEE  INDEED  GREAT 
   SAY     IF THE WHOLE OF MANKIND AND JINNS WERE TO GATHER TOGETHER TO PRODUCE THE LIKE OF THIS QUR ĀN  THEY COULD NOT PRODUCE THE LIKE THEREOF  EVEN IF THEY BACKED UP EACH OTHER WITH HELP AND SUPPORT 
   AND WE HAVE EXPLAINED TO MAN  IN THIS QUR ĀN  EVERY KIND OF SIMILITUDE   YET THE GRATER PART OF MEN REFUSE  TO RECEIVE IT  EXCEPT WITH INGRATITUDE  
   THEY SAY     WE SHALL NOT BELIEVE IN THEE  UNTIL THOU CAUSE A SPRING TO GUSH FORTH FOR US FROM THE EARTH 
     OR  UNTIL  THOU HAVE A GARDEN OF DATE TREES AND VINES  AND CAUSE RIVERS TO GUSH FORTH IN THEIR MIDST  CARRYING ABUNDANT WATER  
     OR THOU CAUSE THE SKY TO FALL IN PIECES  AS THOU SAYEST  WILL HAPPEN   AGAINST US   OR THOU BRING GOD AND THE ANGELS BEFORE  US  FACE TO FACE  
     OR THOU HAVE A HOUSE ADORNED WITH GOLD  OR THOU MOUNT A LADDER RIGHT INTO THE SKIES  NO  WE SHALL NOT EVEN BELIEVE IN THY MOUNTING UNTIL THOU SEND DOWN TO US A BOOK THAT WE COULD READ   SAY     GLORY TO MY LORD   AM I AUGHT BUT A MAN   AN APOSTLE    SECTION  
   WHAT KEPT MEN BACK FROM BELIEF WHEN GUIDANCE CAME TO THEM  WAS NOTHING BUT THIS   THEY SAID    HAS GOD SENT A MAN  LIKE US  TO BE  HIS  APOSTLE    
   SAY    IF THERE WERE SETTLED  ON EARTH  ANGELS WALKING ABOUT IN PEACE AND QUIET  WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SENT THEM DOWN FROM THE HEAVENS AN ANGEL FOR AN APOSTLE  
   SAY     ENOUGH IS GOD FOR A WITNESS BETWEEN ME AND YOU   FOR HE IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIS SERVANTS  AND HE SEES  ALL THINGS   
   IT IS HE WHOM GOD GUIDES  THAT IS ON TRUE GUIDANCE   BUT HE WHOM HE LEAVES ASTRAY FOR SUCH WILT THOU FIND NO PROTECTOR BESIDES HIM  ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT WE SHALL GATHER THEM TOGETHER  PRONE ON THEIR FACES  BLIND  DUMB  AND DEAF   THEIR ABODE WILL BE HELL   EVERY TIME IT SHOWS ABATEMENT  WE SHALL INCREASE FOR THEM THE FIERCENESS OF THE FIRE 
   THAT IS THEIR RECOMPENSE  BECAUSE THEY REJECTED OUR SIGNS  AND SAID    WHEN WE ARE REDUCED TO BONES AND BROKEN DUST  SHOULD WE REALLY BE RAISED UP  TO BE  A NEW CREATION    
   SEE THEY NOT THAT GOD  WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  HAS POWER TO CREATE THE LIKE OF THEM  ANEW    ONLY HE HAS DECREED A TERM APPOINTED  OF WHICH THERE IS NO DOUBT  BUT THE UNJUST REFUSE  TO RECEIVE IT  EXCEPT WITH INGRATITUDE 
   SAY     IF YE HAD CONTROL OF THE TREASURES OF THE MERCY OF MY LORD  BEHOLD  YE WOULD KEEP THEM BACK  FOR FEAR OF SPENDING THEM   FOR MAN IS  EVER  NIGGARDLY    SECTION  
   TO MOSES WE DID GIVE NINE CLEAR SIGNS   ASK THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL   WHEN HE CAME TO THEM  PHARAOH SAID TO HIM     O MOSES   I CONSIDER THEE  INDEED  TO HAVE BEEN WORKED UPON BY SORCERY    
   MOSES SAID    THOU KNOWEST WELL THAT THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN SENT DOWN BY NONE BUT THE LORD OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AS EYE OPENING EVIDENCE   AND I CONSIDER THEE INDEED  O PHARAOH  TO BE ONE DOOMED TO DESTRUCTION    
   SO HE RESOLVED TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH   BUT WE DID DROWN HIM AND ALL WHO WERE WITH HIM 
   AND WE SAID THEREAFTER TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL    DWELL SECURELY IN THE LAND  OF PROMISE      BUT WHEN THE SECOND OF THE WARNINGS CAME TO PASS  WE GATHERED YOU TOGETHER IN A MINGLED CROWD 
   WE SENT DOWN THE  QUR ĀN  IN TRUTH  AND IN TRUTH HAS IT DESCENDED   AND WE SENT THEE BUT TO GIVE GLAD TIDINGS AND TO WARN  SINNERS  
    IT IS  A QUR ĀN WHICH WE HAVE DIVIDED  INTO PARTS FROM TIME TO TIME   IN ORDER THAT THOU MIGHTEST RECITE IT TO MEN AT INTERVALS   WE HAVE REVEALED IT BY STAGES 
   SAY     WHETHER YE BELIEVE IN IT OR NOT  IT IS TRUE THAT THOSE WHO WERE GIVEN KNOWLEDGE BEFOREHAND  WHEN IT IS RECITED TO THEM  FALL DOWN ON THEIR FACES IN HUMBLE PROSTRATION 
     AND THEY SAY     GLORY TO OUR LORD   TRULY HAS THE PROMISE OF OUR LORD BEEN FULFILLED      
   THEY FALL DOWN ON THEIR FACES IN TEARS  AND IT INCREASES THEIR  EARNEST  HUMILITY 
   SAY     CALL UPON GOD  OR CALL UPON RAḤMĀN   BY WHATEVER NAME YE CALL UPON HIM   IT IS WELL    FOR TO HIM BELONG THE MOST BEAUTIFUL NAMES  NEITHER SPEAK THY PRAYER ALOUD  NOR SPEAK IT IN A LOW TONE  BUT SEEK A MIDDLE COURSE BETWEEN  
   SAY     PRAISE BE TO GOD  WHO BEGETS NO SON  AND HAS NO PARTNER IN  HIS  DOMINION   NOR  NEEDS  HE ANY TO PROTECT HIM FROM HUMILIATION   YEA  MAGNIFY HIM FOR HIS GREATNESS AND GLORY    
   PRAISE BE TO GOD  WHO HATH SENT TO HIS SERVANT THE BOOK  AND HATH ALLOWED THEREIN NO CROOKEDNESS  
    HE HATH MADE IT  STRAIGHT  AND CLEAR  IN ORDER THAT HE MAY WARN  THE GODLESS  OF A TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT FROM HIM  AND THAT HE MAY GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO THE BELIEVERS WHO WORK RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  THAT THEY SHALL HAVE A GOODLY REWARD 
   WHEREIN THEY SHALL REMAIN FOR EVER  
   FURTHER  THAT HE MAY WARN THOSE  ALSO  WHO SAY    GOD HATH BEGOTTEN A SON    
   NO KNOWLEDGE HAVE THEY OF SUCH A THING  NOR HAD THEIR FATHERS  IT IS A GRIEVOUS THING THAT ISSUES FROM THEIR MOUTHS AS A SAYING  WHAT THEY SAY IS NOTHING BUT FALSEHOOD  
   THOU WOULDST ONLY  PERCHANCE  FRET THYSELF TO DEATH  FOLLOWING AFTER THEM  IN GRIEF  IF THEY BELIEVE NOT IN THIS MESSAGE 
   THAT WHICH IS ON EARTH WE HAVE MADE BUT AS A GLITTERING SHOW FOR THE EARTH  IN ORDER THAT WE MAY TEST THEM AS TO WHICH OF THEM ARE BEST IN CONDUCT 
   VERILY WHAT IS ON EARTH WE SHALL MAKE BUT AS DUST AND DRY SOIL  WITHOUT GROWTH OR HERBAGE  
   OR DOST THOU REFLECT THAT THE COMPANIONS OF THE CAVE AND OF THE INSCRIPTION WERE WONDERS AMONG OUR SIGNS  
   BEHOLD  THE YOUTHS BETOOK THEMSELVES TO THE CAVE   THEY SAID    OUR LORD   BESTOW ON US MERCY FROM THYSELF  AND DISPOSE OF OUR AFFAIR FOR US IN THE RIGHT WAY    
   THEN WE DREW  A VEIL  OVER THEIR EARS  FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS  IN THE CAVE   SO THAT THEY HEARD NOT   
   THEN WE ROUSED THEM  IN ORDER TO TEST WHICH OF THE TWO PARTIES WAS BEST AT CALCULATING THE TERM OF YEARS THEY HAD TARRIED  SECTION  
   WE RELATE TO THEE THEIR STORY IN TRUTH   THEY WERE YOUTHS WHO BELIEVED IN THEIR LORD  AND WE ADVANCED THEM IN GUIDANCE  
   WE GAVE STRENGTH TO THEIR HEARTS   BEHOLD  THEY STOOD UP AND SAID     OUR LORD IS THE LORD OF THE HEAVENS AND OF THE EARTH   NEVER SHALL WE CALL UPON ANY GOD OTHER THAN HIM   IF WE DID  WE SHOULD INDEED HAVE UTTERED AN ENORMITY  
     THESE OUR PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN FOR WORSHIP GODS OTHER THAN HIM   WHY DO THEY NOT BRING FORWARD AN AUTHORITY CLEAR  AND CONVINCING  FOR WHAT THEY DO   WHO DOTH MORE WRONG THAN SUCH AS INVENT A FALSEHOOD AGAINST GOD  
     WHEN YE TURN AWAY FROM THEM AND THE THINGS THEY WORSHIP OTHER THAN GOD  BETAKE YOURSELVES TO THE CAVE   YOUR LORD WILL SHOWER HIS MERCIES ON YOU AND DISPOSE OF YOUR AFFAIR TOWARDS COMFORT AND EASE  
   THOU WOULDST HAVE SEEN THE SUN  WHEN IT ROSE  DECLINING TO THE RIGHT FROM THEIR CAVE  AND WHEN IT SET  TURNING AWAY FROM THEM TO THE LEFT  WHILE THEY LAY IN THE OPEN SPACE IN THE MIDST OF THE CAVE  SUCH ARE AMONG THE SIGNS OF GOD   HE WHOM GOD GUIDES IS RIGHT GUIDED   BUT HE WHOM GOD LEAVES TO STRAY   FOR HIM WILT THOU FIND NO PROTECTOR TO LEAD HIM TO THE RIGHT WAY SECTION  
   THOU WOULDST HAVE DEEMED THEM AWAKE  WHILST THEY WERE ASLEEP  AND WE TURNED THEM ON THEIR RIGHT AND ON THEIR LEFT SIDES   THEIR DOG STRETCHING FORTH HIS TWO FORE LEGS ON THE THRESHOLD   IF THOU HADST COME UP ON TO THEM  THOU WOULDST HAVE CERTAINLY TURNED BACK FROM THEM IN FLIGHT  AND WOULDST CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH TERROR OF THEM 
   SUCH  BEING THEIR STATE   WE RAISED THEM UP  FROM SLEEP   THAT THEY MIGHT QUESTION EACH OTHER  SAID ONE OF THEM    HOW LONG HAVE YE STAYED  HERE      THEY SAID    WE HAVE STAYED  PERHAPS  A DAY  OR PART OF A DAY    AT LENGTH  THEY  ALL  SAID    GOD  ALONE  KNOWS BEST HOW LONG YE HAVE STAYED HERE  NOW SEND YE THEN ONE OF YOU WITH THIS MONEY OF YOURS TO THE TOWN   LET HIM FIND OUT WHICH IS THE BEST FOOD  TO BE HAD  AND BRING SOME TO YOU  THAT  YE MAY  SATISFY YOUR HUNGER THEREWITH   AND LET HIM BEHAVE WITH CARE AND COURTESY  AND LET HIM NOT INFORM ANY ONE ABOUT YOU 
     FOR IF THY SHOULD COME UPON YOU  THEY WOULD STONE YOU OR FORCE YOU TO RETURN TO THEIR CULT  AND IN THAT CASE YE WOULD NEVER ATTAIN PROSPERITY  
   THUS DID WE MAKE THEIR CASE KNOWN TO THE PEOPLE  THAT THEY MIGHT KNOW THAT THE PROMISE OF GOD IS TRUE  AND THAT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE HOUR OF JUDGMENT  BEHOLD  THEY DISPUTE AMONG THEMSELVES AS TO THEIR AFFAIR   SOME  SAID    CONSTRUCT A BUILDING OVER THEM     THEIR LORD KNOWS BEST ABOUT THEM   THOSE WHO PREVAILED OVER THEIR AFFAIR SAID    LET US SURELY BUILD A PLACE OF WORSHIP OVER THEM  
    SOME  SAY THEY WERE THREE  THE DOG BEING THE FOURTH AMONG THEM    OTHERS  SAY THEY WERE FIVE  THE DOG BEING THE SIXTH  DOUBTFULLY GUESSING AT THE UNKNOWN    YET OTHERS  SAY THEY WERE SEVEN  THE DOG BEING THE EIGHTH  SAY THOU     MY LORD KNOWETH BEST THEIR NUMBER   IT IS BUT FEW THAT KNOW THEIR  REAL CASE    ENTER NOT  THEREFORE  INTO CONTROVERSIES CONCERNING THEM  EXCEPT ON A MATTER THAT IS CLEAR  NOR CONSULT ANY OF THEM ABOUT  THE AFFAIR OF  THE SLEEPERS SECTION  
   NOR SAY OF ANYTHING    I SHALL BE SURE TO DO SO AND SO TO MORROW   
   WITHOUT ADDING    SO PLEASE GOD     AND CALL THY LORD TO MIND WHEN THOU FORGETTEST  AND SAY    I HOPE THAT MY LORD WILL GUIDE ME EVER CLOSER  EVEN  THAN THIS TO THE RIGHT ROAD  
   SO THEY STAYED IN THEIR CAVE THREE HUNDRED YEARS  AND  SOME  ADD NINE  MORE  
   SAY     GOD KNOWS BEST HOW LONG THEY STAYED   WITH HIM IS  THE KNOWLEDGE OF  THE SECRETS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   HOW CLEARLY HE SEES  HOW FINELY HE HEARS  EVERYTHING    THEY HAVE NO PROTECTOR OTHER THAN HIM   NOR DOES HE SHARE HIS COMMAND WITH ANY PERSON WHATSOEVER 
   AND RECITE  AND TEACH  WHAT HAS BEEN REVEALED TO THEE OF THE BOOK OF THY LORD   NONE CAN CHANGE HIS WORDS  AND NONE WILT THOU FIND AS A REFUGE OTHER THAN HIM 
   AND KEEP THY SOUL CONTENT WITH THOSE WHO CALL ON THEIR LORD MORNING AND EVENING  SEEKING HIS FACE   AND LET NOT THINE EYES PASS BEYOND THEM  SEEKING THE POMP AND GLITTER OF THIS LIFE   NOR OBEY ANY WHOSE HEART WE HAVE PERMITTED TO NEGLECT THE REMEMBRANCE OF US  ONE WHO FOLLOWS HIS OWN DESIRES  WHOSE CASE HAS GONE BEYOND ALL BOUNDS 
   SAY    THE TRUTH IS FROM YOUR LORD     LET HIM WHO WILL  BELIEVE  AND LET HIM WHO WILL  REJECT  IT    FOR THE WRONG DOERS WE HAVE PREPARED A FIRE WHOSE  SMOKE AND FLAMES   LIKE THE WALL AND ROOF OF A TENT  WILL HEM THEM IN   IF THEY IMPLORE RELIEF THEY WILL BE GRANTED WATER LIKE MELTED BRASS  THAT WILL SCALD THEIR FACES  HOW DREADFUL THE DRINK   HOW UNCOMFORTABLE A COUCH TO RECLINE ON  
   AS TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS  VERILY WE SHALL NOT SUFFER TO PERISH THE REWARD OF ANY WHO DO A  SINGLE  RIGHTEOUS DEED 
   FOR THEM WILL BE GARDENS OF ETERNITY   BENEATH THEM RIVERS WILL FLOW   THEY WILL BE ADORNED THEREIN WITH BRACELETS OF GOLD  AND THEY WILL WEAR GREEN GARMENTS OF FINE SILK AND HEAVY BROCADE   THEY WILL RECLINE THEREIN ON RAISED THRONES  HOW GOOD THE RECOMPENSE   HOW BEAUTIFUL A COUCH TO RECLINE ON  SECTION  
   SET FORTH TO THEM THE PARABLE OF TWO MEN   FOR ONE OF THEM WE PROVIDED TWO GARDENS OF GRAPE VINES AND SURROUNDED THEM WITH DATE PALMS   IN BETWEEN THE TWO WE PLACED CORN FIELDS 
   EACH OF THOSE GARDENS BROUGHT FORTH ITS PRODUCE  AND FAILED NOT IN THE LEAST THEREIN   IN THE MIDST OF THEM WE CAUSED A RIVER TO FLOW 
    ABUNDANT  WAS THE PRODUCE THIS MAN HAD   HE SAID TO HIS COMPANION  IN THE COURSE OF A MUTUAL ARGUMENT     MORE WEALTH HAVE I THAN YOU  AND MORE HONOUR AND POWER IN  MY FOLLOWING OF  MEN  
   HE WENT INTO HIS GARDEN IN A STATE  OF MIND  UNJUST TO HIS SOUL   HE SAID    I DEEM NOT THAT THIS WILL EVER PERISH 
     NOR DO I DEEM THAT THE HOUR  OF JUDGMENT  WILL  EVER  COME   EVEN IF I AM BROUGHT BACK TO MY LORD  I SHALL SURELY FIND  THERE  SOMETHING BETTER IN EXCHANGE  
   HIS COMPANION SAID TO HIM  IN THE COURSE OF THE ARGUMENT WITH HIM     DOST THOU DENY HIM WHO CREATED THEE OUT OF DUST  THEN OUT OF A SPERM DROP  THEN FASHIONED THEE INTO A MAN  
     BUT  I THINK  FOR MY PART THAT HE IS GOD  MY LORD  AND NONE SHALL I ASSOCIATE WITH MY LORD 
     WHY DIDST THOU NOT  AS THOU WENTEST INTO THY GARDEN  SAY     GOD S WILL  BE DONE    THERE IS NO POWER BUT WITH GOD     IF THOU DOST SEE ME LESS THAN THEE IN WEALTH AND SONS 
     IT MAY BE THAT MY LORD WILL GIVE ME SOMETHING BETTER THAN THY GARDEN  AND THAT HE WILL SEND ON THY GARDEN THUNDERBOLTS  BY WAY OF RECKONING  FROM HEAVEN  MAKING IT  BUT  SLIPPERY SAND   
     OR THE WATER OF THE GARDEN WILL RUN OFF UNDERGROUND SO THAT THOU WILT NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND IT  
   SO HIS FRUITS  AND ENJOYMENT  WERE ENCOMPASSED  WITH RUIN   AND HE REMAINED TWISTING AND TURNING HIS HANDS OVER WHAT HE HAD SPENT ON HIS PROPERTY  WHICH HAD  NOW  TUMBLED TO PIECES TO ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS  AND HE COULD ONLY SAY    WOE IS ME   WOULD I HAD NEVER ASCRIBED PARTNERS TO MY LORD AND CHERISHER    
   NOR HAD HE NUMBERS TO HELP HIM AGAINST GOD  NOR WAS HE ABLE TO DELIVER HIMSELF 
   THERE  THE  ONLY  PROTECTION COMES FROM GOD  THE TRUE ONE  HE IS THE BEST TO REWARD  AND THE BEST TO GIVE SUCCESS SECTION  
   SET FORTH TO THEM THE SIMILITUDE OF THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD   IT IS LIKE THE RAIN WHICH WE SEND DOWN FROM THE SKIES   THE EARTH S VEGETATION ABSORBS IT  BUT SOON IT BECOMES DRY STUBBLE  WHICH THE WINDS DO SCATTER   IT IS  ONLY  GOD WHO PREVAILS OVER ALL THINGS 
   WEALTH AND SONS ARE ALLUREMENTS OF THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD   BUT THE THINGS THAT ENDURE  GOOD DEEDS  ARE BEST IN THE SIGHT OF THY LORD  AS REWARDS  AND BEST AS  THE FOUNDATION FOR  HOPES 
   ONE DAY WE SHALL REMOVE THE MOUNTAINS  AND THOU WILT SEE THE EARTH AS A LEVEL STRETCH  AND WE SHALL GATHER THEM  ALL TOGETHER  NOR SHALL WE LEAVE OUT ANY ONE OF THEM 
   AND THEY WILL BE MARSHALLED BEFORE THY LORD IN RANKS   WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT     NOW HAVE YE COME TO US  BARE  AS WE CREATED YOU FIRST   AYE  YE THOUGHT WE SHALL NOT FULFIL THE APPOINTMENT MADE TO YOU TO MEET  US       
   AND THE BOOK  OF DEEDS  WILL BE PLACED  BEFORE YOU    AND THOU WILT SEE THE SINFUL IN GREAT TERROR BECAUSE OF WHAT IS  RECORDED  THEREIN   THEY WILL SAY    AH   WOE TO US   WHAT A BOOK IS THIS   IT LEAVES OUT NOTHING SMALL OR GREAT  BUT TAKES ACCOUNT THEREOF     THEY WILL FIND ALL THAT THEY DID  PLACED BEFORE THEM   AND NOT ONE WILL THY LORD TREAT WITH INJUSTICE SECTION  
   BEHOLD   WE SAID TO THE ANGELS    BOW DOWN TO ADAM     THEY BOWED DOWN EXCEPT IBLĪS  HE WAS ONE OF THE JINNS  AND HE BROKE THE COMMAND OF HIS LORD  WILL YE THEN TAKE HIM AND HIS PROGENY AS PROTECTORS RATHER THAN ME   AND THEY ARE ENEMIES TO YOU   EVIL WOULD BE THE EXCHANGE FOR THE WRONG DOERS  
   I CALLED THEM NOT TO WITNESS THE CREATION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  NOR  EVEN  THEIR OWN CREATION   NOR IS IT FOR ME TO TAKE AS HELPERS SUCH AS LEAD  MEN  ASTRAY  
   ONE DAY HE WILL SAY    CALL ON THOSE WHOM YE THOUGHT TO BE MY PARTNERS   AND THEY WILL CALL ON THEM  BUT THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO THEM   AND WE SHALL MAKE FOR THEM A PLACE OF COMMON PERDITION 
   AND THE SINFUL SHALL SEE THE FIRE AND APPREHEND THAT THEY HAVE TO FALL THEREIN   NO MEANS WILL THEY FIND TO TURN AWAY THEREFROM SECTION  
   WE HAVE EXPLAINED IN DETAIL IN THIS QUR ĀN  FOR THE BENEFIT OF MANKIND  EVERY KIND OF SIMILITUDE   BUT MAN IS  IN MOST THINGS  CONTENTIOUS 
   AND WHAT IS THERE TO KEEP BACK MEN FROM BELIEVING  NOW THAT GUIDANCE HAS COME TO THEM  NOR FROM PRAYING FOR FORGIVENESS FROM THEIR LORD  BUT THAT  THEY ASK THAT  THE WAYS OF THE ANCIENTS BE REPEATED WITH THEM  OR THE WRATH BE BROUGHT TO THEM FACE TO FACE  
   WE ONLY SEND THE APOSTLES TO GIVE GLAD TIDINGS AND TO GIVE WARNINGS   BUT THE UNBELIEVERS DISPUTE WITH VAIN ARGUMENT  IN ORDER THEREWITH TO WEAKEN THE TRUTH  AND THEY TREAT MY SIGNS AS A JEST  AS ALSO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE WARNED  
   AND WHO DOTH MORE WRONG THAN ONE WHO IS REMINDED OF THE SIGNS OF HIS LORD  BUT TURNS AWAY FROM THEM  FORGETTING THE  DEEDS  WHICH HIS HANDS HAVE SENT FORTH   VERILY WE HAVE SET VEILS OVER THEIR HEARTS LEST THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND THIS  AND OVER THEIR EARS  DEAFNESS  IF THOU CALLEST THEM TO GUIDANCE  EVEN THEN WILL THEY NEVER ACCEPT GUIDANCE 
   BUT YOUR LORD IS MOST FORGIVING  FULL OF MERCY  IF HE WERE TO CALL THEM  AT ONCE  TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT THEY HAVE EARNED  THEN SURELY HE WOULD HAVE HASTENED THEIR PUNISHMENT   BUT THEY HAVE THEIR APPOINTED TIME  BEYOND WHICH THEY WILL FIND NO REFUGE 
   SUCH WERE THE POPULATIONS WE DESTROYED WHEN THEY COMMITTED INIQUITIES   BUT WE FIXED AN APPOINTED TIME FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION SECTION  
   BEHOLD  MOSES SAID TO HIS ATTENDANT    I WILL NOT GIVE UP UNTIL I REACH THE JUNCTION OF THE TWO SEAS OR  UNTIL  I SPEND YEARS AND YEARS IN TRAVEL  
   BUT WHEN THEY REACHED THE JUNCTION  THEY FORGOT  ABOUT  THEIR FISH  WHICH TOOK ITS COURSE THROUGH THE SEA  STRAIGHT  AS IN A TUNNEL 
   WHEN THEY HAD PASSED ON  SOME DISTANCE   MOSES SAID TO HIS ATTENDANT     BRING US OUR EARLY MEAL   TRULY WE HAVE SUFFERED MUCH FATIGUE AT THIS  STAGE OF  OUR JOURNEY  
   HE REPLIED     SAWEST THOU  WHAT HAPPENED  WHEN WE BETOOK OURSELVES TO THE ROCK   I DID INDEED FORGET  ABOUT  THE FISH   NONE BUT SATAN MADE ME FORGET TO TELL  YOU  ABOUT IT   IT TOOK ITS COURSE THROUGH THE SEA IN A MARVELLOUS WAY    
   MOSES SAID     THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE SEEKING AFTER     SO THEY WENT BACK ON THEIR FOOTSTEPS  FOLLOWING  THE PATH THEY HAD COME  
   SO THEY FOUND ONE OF OUR SERVANTS  ON WHOM WE HAD BESTOWED MERCY FROM OURSELVES AND WHOM WE HAD TAUGHT KNOWLEDGE FROM OUR OWN PRESENCE 
   MOSES SAID TO HIM     MAY I FOLLOW THEE  ON THE FOOTING THAT THOU TEACH ME SOMETHING OF THE  HIGHER  TRUTH WHICH THOU HAST BEEN TAUGHT    
    THE OTHER  SAID     VERILY THOU WILT NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE PATIENCE WITH ME  
     AND HOW CANST THOU HAVE PATIENCE ABOUT THINGS ABOUT WHICH THY UNDERSTANDING IS NOT COMPLETE    
   MOSES SAID     THOU WILT FIND ME  IF GOD SO WILL   TRULY  PATIENT   NOR SHALL I DISOBEY THEE IN AUGHT  
   THE OTHER SAID     IF THEN THOU WOULDST FOLLOW ME  ASK ME NO QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYTHING UNTIL I MYSELF SPEAK TO THEE CONCERNING IT  SECTION  
   SO THEY BOTH PROCEEDED   UNTIL  WHEN THEY WERE IN THE BOAT  HE SCUTTLED IT  SAID MOSES     HAST THOU SCUTTLED IT IN ORDER TO DROWN THOSE IN IT   TRULY A STRANGE THING HAST THOU DONE    
   HE ANSWERED     DID I NOT TELL THEE THAT THOU CANST HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH ME    
   MOSES SAID     REBUKE ME NOT FOR FORGETTING  NOR GRIEVE ME BY RAISING DIFFICULTIES IN MY CASE  
   THEN THEY PROCEEDED   UNTIL  WHEN THEY MET A YOUNG MAN  HE SLEW HIM  MOSES SAID     HAST THOU SLAIN AN INNOCENT PERSON WHO HAD SLAIN NONE   TRULY A FOUL  UNHEARD OF  THING HAST THOU DONE    
   HE ANSWERED     DID I NOT TELL THEE THAT THOU CANST HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH ME    
    MOSES  SAID     IF EVER I ASK THEE ABOUT ANYTHING AFTER THIS  KEEP ME NOT IN THY COMPANY   THEN WOULDST THOU HAVE RECEIVED  FULL  EXCUSE FROM MY SIDE  
   THEN THEY PROCEEDED   UNTIL  WHEN THEY CAME TO THE INHABITANTS OF A TOWN  THEY ASKED THEM FOR FOOD  BUT THEY REFUSED THEM HOSPITALITY  THEY FOUND THERE A WALL ON THE POINT OF FALLING DOWN  BUT HE SET IT UP STRAIGHT   MOSES  SAID     IF THOU HADST WISHED  SURELY THOU COULDST HAVE EXACTED SOME RECOMPENSE FOR IT    
   HE ANSWERED     THIS IS THE PARTING BETWEEN ME AND THEE   NOW WILL I TELL THEE THE INTERPRETATION OF  THOSE THINGS  OVER WHICH THOU WAST UNABLE TO HOLD PATIENCE 
     AS FOR THE BOAT  IT BELONGED TO CERTAIN MEN IN DIRE WANT   THEY PLIED ON THE WATER   I BUT WISHED TO RENDER IT UNSERVICEABLE  FOR THERE WAS AFTER THEM A CERTAIN KING WHO SEIZED ON EVERY BOAT BY FORCE 
     AS FOR THE YOUTH  HIS PARENTS WERE PEOPLE OF FAITH  AND WE FEARED THAT HE WOULD GRIEVE THEM BY OBSTINATE REBELLION AND INGRATITUDE  TO GOD AND MAN  
     SO WE DESIRED THAT THEIR LORD WOULD GIVE THEM IN EXCHANGE  A SON  BETTER IN PURITY  OF CONDUCT  AND CLOSER IN AFFECTION 
     AS FOR THE WALL  IT BELONGED TO TWO YOUTHS  ORPHANS  IN THE TOWN   THERE WAS  BENEATH IT  A BURIED TREASURE  TO WHICH THEY WERE ENTITLED   THEIR FATHER HAD BEEN A RIGHTEOUS MAN   SO THY LORD DESIRED THAT THEY SHOULD ATTAIN THEIR AGE OF FULL STRENGTH AND GET OUT THEIR TREASURE A MERCY  AND FAVOUR  FROM THY LORD  I DID IT NOT OF MY OWN ACCORD  SUCH IS THE INTERPRETATION OF  THOSE THINGS  OVER WHICH THOU WAST UNABLE TO HOLD PATIENCE  SECTION  
   THEY ASK THEE CONCERNING ẒUL QARNAIN  SAY    I WILL REHEARSE TO YOU SOMETHING OF HIS STORY  
   VERILY WE ESTABLISHED HIS POWER ON EARTH  AND WE GAVE HIM THE WAYS AND THE MEANS TO ALL ENDS 
   ONE  SUCH  WAY HE FOLLOWED 
   UNTIL  WHEN HE REACHED THE SETTING OF THE SUN  HE FOUND IT SET IN A SPRING OF MURKY WATER   NEAR IT HE FOUND A PEOPLE   WE SAID     O ẒUL QARNAIN    THOU HAST AUTHORITY   EITHER TO PUNISH THEM  OR TO TREAT THEM WITH KINDNESS  
   HE SAID     WHOEVER DOTH WRONG  HIM SHALL WE PUNISH   THEN SHALL HE BE SENT BACK TO HIS LORD   AND HE WILL PUNISH HIM WITH A PUNISHMENT UNHEARD OF  BEFORE  
     BUT WHOEVER BELIEVES  AND WORKS RIGHTEOUSNESS   HE SHALL HAVE A GOODLY REWARD  AND EASY WILL BE HIS TASK AS WE ORDER IT BY OUR COMMAND  
   THEN FOLLOWED HE  ANOTHER  WAY 
   UNTIL  WHEN HE CAME TO THE RISING OF THE SUN  HE FOUND IT RISING ON A PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE HAD PROVIDED NO COVERING PROTECTION AGAINST THE SUN 
    HE LEFT THEM  AS THEY WERE   WE COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS BEFORE HIM 
   THEN FOLLOWED HE  ANOTHER  WAY 
   UNTIL  WHEN HE REACHED  A TRACT  BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS  HE FOUND  BENEATH THEM  A PEOPLE WHO SCARCELY UNDERSTOOD A WORD 
   THEY SAID     O ẒUL QARNAIN   THE GOG AND MAGOG  PEOPLE  DO GREAT MISCHIEF ON EARTH   SHALL WE THEN RENDER THEE TRIBUTE IN ORDER THAT THOU MIGHTEST ERECT A BARRIER BETWEEN US AND THEM    
   HE SAID      THE POWER  IN WHICH MY LORD HAS ESTABLISHED ME IS BETTER  THAN TRIBUTE    HELP ME THEREFORE WITH STRENGTH  AND LABOUR    I WILL ERECT A STRONG BARRIER BETWEEN YOU AND THEM  
     BRING ME BLOCKS OF IRON   AT LENGTH  WHEN HE HAD FILLED UP THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO STEEP MOUNTAIN SIDES  HE SAID    BLOW  WITH YOUR BELLOWS    THEN  WHEN HE HAD MADE IT  RED  AS FIRE  HE SAID     BRING ME  THAT I MAY POUR OVER IT  MOLTEN LEAD  
   THUS WERE THEY MADE POWERLESS TO SCALE IT OR TO DIG THROUGH IT 
   HE SAID     THIS IS A MERCY FROM MY LORD   BUT WHEN THE PROMISE OF MY LORD COMES TO PASS  HE WILL MAKE IT INTO DUST   AND THE PROMISE OF MY LORD IS TRUE  
   ON THAT DAY WE SHALL LEAVE THEM TO SURGE LIKE WAVES ON ONE ANOTHER   THE TRUMPET WILL BE BLOWN  AND WE SHALL COLLECT THEM ALL TOGETHER 
   AND WE SHALL PRESENT HELL THAT DAY FOR UNBELIEVERS TO SEE  ALL SPREAD OUT  
    UNBELIEVERS  WHOSE EYES HAD BEEN UNDER A VEIL FROM REMEMBRANCE OF ME  AND WHO HAD BEEN UNABLE EVEN TO HEAR SECTION  
   DO THE UNBELIEVERS THINK THAT THEY CAN TAKE MY SERVANTS AS PROTECTORS BESIDES ME   VERILY WE HAVE PREPARED HELL FOR THE UNBELIEVERS FOR  THEIR  ENTERTAINMENT 
   SAY     SHALL WE TELL YOU OF THOSE WHO LOSE MOST IN RESPECT OF THEIR DEEDS   
     THOSE WHOSE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN WASTED IN THIS LIFE  WHILE THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE ACQUIRING GOOD BY THEIR WORKS    
   THEY ARE THOSE WHO DENY THE SIGNS OF THEIR LORD AND THE FACT OF THEIR HAVING TO MEET HIM  IN THE HEREAFTER    VAIN WILL BE THEIR WORKS  NOR SHALL WE  ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  GIVE THEM ANY WEIGHT 
   THAT IS THEIR REWARD  HELL   BECAUSE THEY REJECTED FAITH  AND TOOK MY SIGNS AND MY MESSENGERS BY WAY OF JEST 
   AS TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  THEY HAVE  FOR THEIR ENTERTAINMENT  THE GARDENS OF PARADISE 
   WHEREIN THEY SHALL DWELL  FOR AYE    NO CHANGE WILL THEY WISH FOR FROM THEM 
   SAY     IF THE OCEAN WERE INK  WHEREWITH TO WRITE OUT  THE WORDS OF MY LORD  SOONER WOULD THE OCEAN BE EXHAUSTED THAN WOULD THE WORDS OF MY LORD  EVEN IF WE ADDED ANOTHER OCEAN LIKE IT  FOR ITS AID  
   SAY     I AM BUT A MAN LIKE YOURSELVES   BUT  THE INSPIRATION HAS COME TO ME  THAT YOUR GOD IS ONE GOD   WHOEVER EXPECTS TO MEET HIS LORD  LET HIM WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS  AND  IN THE WORSHIP OF HIS LORD  ADMIT NO ONE AS PARTNER  
   KĀF  HĀ  YĀ   AIN  ṢĀD 
    THIS IS  A RECITAL OF THE MERCY OF THY LORD TO HIS SERVANT ZAKARĪYA 
   BEHOLD   HE CRIED TO HIS LORD IN SECRET 
   PRAYING     O MY LORD   INFIRM INDEED ARE MY BONES  AND THE HAIR OF MY HEAD DOTH GLISTEN WITH GREY   BUT NEVER AM I UNBLEST  O MY LORD  IN MY PRAYER TO THEE  
     NOW I FEAR  WHAT  MY RELATIVES  AND COLLEAGUES   WILL DO  AFTER ME   BUT MY WIFE IS BARREN   SO GIVE ME AN HEIR AS FROM THYSELF  
      ONE THAT  WILL  TRULY  REPRESENT ME  AND REPRESENT THE POSTERITY OF JACOB   AND MAKE HIM  O MY LORD   ONE WITH WHOM THOU ART WELL PLEASED    
    HIS PRAYER WAS ANSWERED      O ZAKARĪYA   WE GIVE THEE GOOD NEWS OF A SON   HIS NAME SHALL BE YAḤYĀ   ON NONE BY THAT NAME HAVE WE CONFERRED DISTINCTION BEFORE  
   HE SAID     O MY LORD   HOW SHALL I HAVE A SON  WHEN MY WIFE IS BARREN AND I HAVE GROWN QUITE DECREPIT FROM OLD AGE    
   HE SAID     SO  IT WILL BE    THY LORD SAITH    THAT IS EASY FOR ME   I DID INDEED CREATE THEE BEFORE  WHEN THOU HADST BEEN NOTHING      
    ZAKARĪYA  SAID     O MY LORD   GIVE ME A SIGN     THY SIGN   WAS THE ANSWER    SHALL BE THAT THOU SHALT SPEAK TO NO MAN FOR THREE NIGHTS  ALTHOUGH THOU ART NOT DUMB  
   SO ZAKARĪYA CAME OUT TO HIS PEOPLE FROM HIS CHAMBER   HE TOLD THEM BY SIGNS TO CELEBRATE GOD S PRAISES IN THE MORNING AND IN THE EVENING 
    TO HIS SON CAME THE COMMAND      O YAḤYĀ   TAKE HOLD OF THE BOOK WITH MIGHT     AND WE GAVE HIM WISDOM EVEN AS A YOUTH 
   AND PITY  FOR ALL CREATURES  AS FROM US  AND PURITY   HE WAS DEVOUT 
   AND KIND TO HIS PARENTS  AND HE WAS NOT OVERBEARING OR REBELLIOUS 
   SO PEACE ON HIM THE DAY HE WAS BORN  THE DAY THAT HE DIES  AND THE DAY THAT HE WILL BE RAISED UP TO LIFE  AGAIN   SECTION  
   RELATE IN THE BOOK  THE STORY OF  MARY  WHEN SHE WITHDREW FROM HER FAMILY TO A PLACE IN THE EAST 
   SHE PLACED A SCREEN  TO SCREEN HERSELF  FROM THEM   THEN WE SENT TO HER OUR ANGEL  AND HE APPEARED BEFORE HER AS A MAN IN ALL RESPECTS 
   SHE SAID     I SEEK REFUGE FROM THEE TO  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS    COME NOT NEAR  IF THOU DOST FEAR GOD  
   HE SAID     NAY  I AM ONLY A MESSENGER FROM THY LORD   TO ANNOUNCE  TO THEE THE GIFT OF A HOLY SON  
   SHE SAID     HOW SHALL I HAVE A SON  SEEING THAT NO MAN HAS TOUCHED ME  AND I AM NOT UNCHASTE    
   HE SAID     SO  IT WILL BE    THY LORD SAITH    THAT IS EASY FOR ME   AND  WE WISH  TO APPOINT HIM AS A SIGN UNTO MEN AND A MERCY FROM US     IT IS A MATTER  SO  DECREED  
   SO SHE CONCEIVED HIM  AND SHE RETIRED WITH HIM TO A REMOTE PLACE 
   AND THE PAINS OF CHILDBIRTH DROVE HER TO THE TRUNK OF A PALM TREE   SHE CRIED  IN HER ANGUISH      AH   WOULD THAT I HAD DIED BEFORE THIS   WOULD THAT I HAD BEEN A THING FORGOTTEN AND OUT OF SIGHT    
   BUT  A VOICE  CRIED TO HER FROM BENEATH THE  PALM TREE      GRIEVE NOT   FOR THY LORD HATH PROVIDED A RIVULET BENEATH THEE  
     AND SHAKE TOWARDS THYSELF THE TRUNK OF THE PALM TREE   IT WILL LET FALL FRESH RIPE DATES UPON THEE 
     SO EAT AND DRINK AND COOL  THINE  EYE  AND IF THOU DOST SEE ANY MAN  SAY    I HAVE VOWED A FAST TO  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  AND THIS DAY WILL I ENTER INTO NO TALK WITH ANY HUMAN BEING    
   AT LENGTH SHE BROUGHT THE  BABE  TO HER PEOPLE  CARRYING HIM  IN HER ARMS   THEY SAID     O MARY   TRULY AN AMAZING THING HAST THOU BROUGHT  
     O SISTER OF AARON   THY FATHER WAS NOT A MAN OF EVIL  NOR THY MOTHER A WOMAN UNCHASTE    
   BUT SHE POINTED TO THE BABE  THEY SAID     HOW CAN WE TALK TO ONE WHO IS A CHILD IN THE CRADLE    
   HE SAID     I AM INDEED A SERVANT OF GOD   HE HATH GIVEN ME REVELATION AND MADE ME A PROPHET  
     AND HE HATH MADE ME BLESSED WHERESOEVER I BE  AND HATH ENJOINED ON ME PRAYER AND CHARITY AS LONG AS I LIVE  
      HE  HATH MADE ME KIND TO MY MOTHER  AND NOT OVERBEARING OR MISERABLE  
     SO PEACE IS ON ME THE DAY I WAS BORN  THE DAY THAT I DIE  AND THE DAY THAT I SHALL BE RAISED UP TO LIFE  AGAIN     
   SUCH  WAS  JESUS THE SON OF MARY    IT IS  A STATEMENT OF TRUTH  ABOUT WHICH THEY  VAINLY  DISPUTE 
   IT IS NOT BEFITTING TO  THE MAJESTY OF  GOD THAT HE SHOULD BEGET A SON  GLORY BE TO HIM   WHEN HE DETERMINES A MATTER  HE ONLY SAYS TO IT    BE    AND IT IS 
   VERILY GOD IS MY LORD AND YOUR LORD   HIM THEREFORE SERVE YE   THIS IS A WAY THAT IS STRAIGHT 
   BUT THE SECTS DIFFER AMONG THEMSELVES   AND WOE TO THE UNBELIEVERS BECAUSE OF THE  COMING  JUDGMENT OF A MOMENTOUS DAY  
   HOW PLAINLY WILL THEY SEE AND HEAR  THE DAY THAT THEY WILL APPEAR BEFORE US   BUT THE UNJUST TO DAY ARE IN ERROR MANIFEST  
   BUT WARN THEM OF THE DAY OF DISTRESS  WHEN THE MATTER WILL BE DETERMINED   FOR  BEHOLD   THEY ARE NEGLIGENT AND THEY DO NOT BELIEVE  
   IT IS WE WHO WILL INHERIT THE EARTH  AND ALL BEINGS THEREON   TO US WILL THEY ALL BE RETURNED SECTION  
    ALSO  MENTION IN THE BOOK  THE STORY OF  ABRAHAM   HE WAS A MAN OF TRUTH  A PROPHET 
   BEHOLD  HE SAID TO HIS FATHER     O MY FATHER   WHY WORSHIP THAT WHICH HEARETH NOT AND SEETH NOT  AND CAN PROFIT THEE NOTHING  
     O MY FATHER   TO ME HATH COME KNOWLEDGE WHICH HATH NOT REACHED THEE   SO FOLLOW ME   I WILL GUIDE THEE TO A WAY THAT IS EVEN AND STRAIGHT 
     O MY FATHER   SERVE NOT SATAN   FOR SATAN IS A REBEL AGAINST  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS 
     O MY FATHER   I FEAR LEST A PENALTY AFFLICT THEE FROM  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  SO THAT THOU BECOME TO SATAN A FRIEND  
    THE FATHER  REPLIED     DOST THOU HATE MY GODS  O ABRAHAM   IF THOU FORBEAR NOT  I WILL INDEED STONE THEE   NOW GET AWAY FROM ME FOR A GOOD LONG WHILE    
   ABRAHAM SAID     PEACE BE ON THEE   I WILL PRAY TO MY LORD FOR THY FORGIVENESS   FOR HE IS TO ME MOST GRACIOUS 
     AND I WILL TURN AWAY FROM YOU  ALL  AND FROM THOSE WHOM YE INVOKE BESIDES GOD   I WILL CALL ON MY LORD   PERHAPS  BY MY PRAYER TO MY LORD  I SHALL BE NOT UNBLEST  
   WHEN HE HAD TURNED AWAY FROM THEM AND FROM THOSE WHOM THEY WORSHIPPED BESIDES GOD  WE BESTOWED ON HIM ISAAC AND JACOB  AND EACH ONE OF THEM WE MADE A PROPHET 
   AND WE BESTOWED OF OUR MERCY ON THEM  AND WE GRANTED THEM LOFTY HONOUR ON THE TONGUE OF TRUTH SECTION  
   ALSO MENTION IN THE BOOK  THE STORY OF  MOSES   FOR HE WAS SPECIALLY CHOSEN  AND HE WAS AN APOSTLE  AND  A PROPHET 
   AND WE CALLED HIM FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF MOUNT  SINAI   AND MADE HIM DRAW NEAR TO US  FOR MYSTIC  CONVERSE  
   AND OUT OF OUR MERCY  WE GAVE HIM HIS BROTHER AARON   ALSO  A PROPHET 
   ALSO MENTION IN THE BOOK  THE STORY OF  ISMĀ ĪL   HE WAS  STRICTLY  TRUE TO WHAT HE PROMISED  AND HE WAS AN APOSTLE  AND  A PROPHET 
   HE USED TO ENJOIN ON HIS PEOPLE PRAYER AND CHARITY  AND HE WAS MOST ACCEPTABLE IN THE SIGHT OF HIS LORD 
   ALSO MENTION IN THE BOOK THE CASE OF IDRĪS   HE WAS A MAN OF TRUTH  AND SINCERITY    AND  A PROPHET  
   AND WE RAISED HIM TO A LOFTY STATION 
   THOSE WERE SOME OF THE PROPHETS ON WHOM GOD DID BESTOW HIS GRACE   OF THE POSTERITY OF ADAM  AND OF THOSE WHOM WE CARRIED  IN THE ARK  WITH NOAH  AND OF THE POSTERITY OF ABRAHAM AND ISRAEL OF THOSE WHOM WE GUIDED AND CHOSE  WHENEVER THE SIGNS OF  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS WERE REHEARSED TO THEM  THEY WOULD FALL DOWN IN PROSTRATE ADORATION AND IN TEARS 
   BUT AFTER THEM THERE FOLLOWED A POSTERITY WHO MISSED PRAYERS AND FOLLOWED AFTER LUSTS  SOON  THEN  WILL THEY FACE DESTRUCTION  
   EXCEPT THOSE WHO REPENT AND BELIEVE  AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS   FOR THESE WILL ENTER THE GARDEN AND WILL NOT BE WRONGED IN THE LEAST  
   GARDENS OF ETERNITY  THOSE WHICH  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS HAS PROMISED TO HIS SERVANTS IN THE UNSEEN   FOR HIS PROMISE MUST  NECESSARILY  COME TO PASS 
   THEY WILL NOT THERE HEAR ANY VAIN DISCOURSE  BUT ONLY SALUTATIONS OF PEACE   AND THEY WILL HAVE THEREIN THEIR SUSTENANCE  MORNING AND EVENING 
   SUCH IS THE GARDEN WHICH WE GIVE AS AN INHERITANCE TO THOSE OF OUR SERVANTS WHO GUARD AGAINST EVIL 
    THE ANGELS SAY &COLON     WE DESCEND NOT BUT BY COMMAND OF THY LORD   TO HIM BELONGETH WHAT IS BEFORE US AND WHAT IS BEHIND US  AND WHAT IS BETWEEN   AND THY LORD NEVER DOTH FORGET  
     LORD OF THE HEAVENS AND OF THE EARTH  AND OF ALL THAT IS BETWEEN THEM   SO WORSHIP HIM  AND BE CONSTANT AND PATIENT IN HIS WORSHIP   KNOWEST THOU OF ANY WHO IS WORTHY OF THE SAME NAME AS HE    SECTION  
   MAN SAYS     WHAT   WHEN I AM DEAD  SHALL I THEN BE RAISED UP ALIVE    
   BUT DOES NOT MAN CALL TO MIND THAT WE CREATED HIM BEFORE OUT OF NOTHING  
   SO  BY THY LORD  WITHOUT DOUBT  WE SHALL GATHER THEM TOGETHER  AND  ALSO  THE EVIL ONES  WITH THEM    THEN SHALL WE BRING THEM FORTH ON THEIR KNEES ROUND ABOUT HELL  
   THEN SHALL WE CERTAINLY DRAG OUT FROM EVERY SECT ALL THOSE WHO WERE WORST IN OBSTINATE REBELLION AGAINST  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS 
   AND CERTAINLY WE KNOW BEST THOSE WHO ARE MOST WORTHY OF BEING BURNED THEREIN 
   NOT ONE OF YOU BUT WILL PASS OVER IT   THIS IS  WITH THY LORD  A DECREE WHICH MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED 
   BUT WE SHALL SAVE THOSE WHO GUARDED AGAINST EVIL  AND WE SHALL LEAVE THE WRONG DOERS THEREIN   HUMBLED  TO THEIR KNEES 
   WHEN OUR CLEAR SIGNS ARE REHEARSED TO THEM  THE UNBELIEVERS SAY TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE    WHICH OF THE TWO SIDES IS BEST IN POINT OF POSITION   WHICH MAKES THE BEST SHOW IN COUNCIL    
   BUT HOW MANY  COUNTLESS  GENERATIONS BEFORE THEM HAVE WE DESTROYED  WHO WERE EVEN BETTER IN EQUIPMENT AND IN GLITTER TO THE EYE  
   SAY     IF ANY MEN GO ASTRAY   GOD  MOST GRACIOUS EXTENDS  THE ROPE  TO THEM  UNTIL  WHEN THEY SEE THE WARNING OF GOD  BEING FULFILLED  EITHER IN PUNISHMENT OR IN  THE APPROACH OF  THE HOUR  THEY WILL AT LENGTH REALISE WHO IS WORST IN POSITION  AND  WHO  WEAKEST IN FORCES  
     AND GOD DOTH ADVANCE IN GUIDANCE THOSE WHO SEEK GUIDANCE   AND THE THINGS THAT ENDURE  GOOD DEEDS  ARE BEST IN THE SIGHT OF THY LORD  AS REWARDS  AND BEST IN RESPECT OF  THEIR  EVENTUAL RETURNS  
   HAST THOU THEN SEEN THE  SORT OF  MAN WHO REJECTS OUR SIGNS  YET SAYS     I SHALL CERTAINLY BE GIVEN WEALTH AND CHILDREN    
   HAS HE PENETRATED TO THE UNSEEN  OR HAS HE TAKEN A CONTRACT WITH  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  
   NAY   WE SHALL RECORD WHAT HE SAYS  AND WE SHALL ADD AND ADD TO HIS PUNISHMENT 
   TO US SHALL RETURN ALL THAT HE TALKS OF  AND HE SHALL APPEAR BEFORE US BARE AND ALONE 
   AND THEY HAVE TAKEN  FOR WORSHIP  GODS OTHER THAN GOD  TO GIVE THEM POWER AND GLORY  
   INSTEAD  THEY SHALL REJECT THEIR WORSHIP  AND BECOME ADVERSARIES AGAINST THEM SECTION  
   SEEST THOU NOT THAT WE HAVE SET THE EVIL ONES ON AGAINST THE UNBELIEVERS  TO INCITE THEM WITH FURY  
   SO MAKE NO HASTE AGAINST THEM  FOR WE BUT COUNT OUT TO THEM A  LIMITED  NUMBER  OF DAYS  
   THE DAY WE SHALL GATHER THE RIGHTEOUS TO  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  LIKE A BAND PRESENTED BEFORE A KING FOR HONOURS 
   AND WE SHALL DRIVE THE SINNERS TO HELL  LIKE THIRSTY CATTLE DRIVEN DOWN TO WATER  
   NONE SHALL HAVE THE POWER OF INTERCESSION  BUT SUCH A ONE AS HAS RECEIVED PERMISSION  OR PROMISE  FROM  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS 
   THEY SAY      GOD  MOST GRACIOUS HAS BEGOTTEN A SON    
   INDEED YE HAVE PUT FORTH A THING MOST MONSTROUS  
   AT IT THE SKIES ARE READY TO BURST  THE EARTH TO SPLIT ASUNDER  AND THE MOUNTAINS TO FALL DOWN IN UTTER RUIN 
   THAT THEY SHOULD INVOKE A SON FOR  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS 
   FOR IT IS NOT CONSONANT WITH THE MAJESTY OF  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS THAT HE SHOULD BEGET A SON 
   NOT ONE OF THE BEINGS IN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH BUT MUST COME TO  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS AS A SERVANT 
   HE DOES TAKE AND ACCOUNT OF THEM  ALL   AND HATH NUMBERED THEM  ALL  EXACTLY 
   AND EVERYONE OF THEM WILL COME TO HIM SINGLY ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 
   ON THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  WILL  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS BESTOW LOVE 
   SO HAVE WE MADE THE  QUR ĀN  EASY IN THINE OWN TONGUE  THAT WITH IT THOU MAYEST GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO THE RIGHTEOUS  AND WARNINGS TO PEOPLE GIVEN TO CONTENTION 
   BUT HOW MANY  COUNTLESS  GENERATIONS BEFORE THEM HAVE WE DESTROYED   CANST THOU FIND A SINGLE ONE OF THEM  NOW  OR HEAR  SO MUCH AS  A WHISPER OF THEM  
   ṬĀ HÁ 
   WE HAVE NOT SENT DOWN THE QUR ĀN TO THEE TO BE  AN OCCASION  FOR THY DISTRESS 
   BUT ONLY AS AN ADMONITION TO THOSE WHO FEAR  GOD   
   A REVELATION FROM HIM WHO CREATED THE EARTH AND THE HEAVENS ON HIGH 
    GOD  MOST GRACIOUS IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED ON THE THRONE  OF AUTHORITY  
   TO HIM BELONGS WHAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  AND ALL BETWEEN THEM  AND ALL BENEATH THE SOIL 
   IF THOU PRONOUNCE THE WORD ALOUD   IT IS NO MATTER    FOR VERILY HE KNOWETH WHAT IS SECRET AND WHAT IS YET MORE HIDDEN 
   GOD   THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE   TO HIM BELONG THE MOST BEAUTIFUL NAMES 
   HAS THE STORY OF MOSES REACHED THEE  
   BEHOLD  HE SAW A FIRE   SO HE SAID TO HIS FAMILY    TARRY YE   I PERCEIVE A FIRE   PERHAPS I CAN BRING YOU SOME BURNING BRAND THEREFROM  OR FIND SOME GUIDANCE AT THE FIRE  
   BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE FIRE  A VOICE WAS HEARD     O MOSES  
     VERILY I AM THY LORD   THEREFORE  IN MY PRESENCE  PUT OFF THY SHOES   THOU ART IN THE SACRED VALLEY ṬUWĀ 
     I HAVE CHOSEN THEE   LISTEN  THEN  TO THE INSPIRATION  SENT TO THEE  
     VERILY  I AM GOD   THERE IS NO GOD BUT I   SO SERVE THOU ME  ONLY   AND ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER FOR CELEBRATING MY PRAISE 
     VERILY THE HOUR IS COMING  MY DESIGN IS TO KEEP IT HIDDEN FOR EVERY SOUL TO RECEIVE ITS REWARD BY THE MEASURE OF ITS ENDEAVOUR 
     THEREFORE LET NOT SUCH AS BELIEVE NOT THEREIN BUT FOLLOW THEIR OWN LUSTS  DIVERT THEE THEREFROM  LEST THOU PERISH     
     AND WHAT IS THAT IN THY RIGHT HAND  O MOSES    
   HE SAID    IT IS MY ROD   ON IT I LEAN   WITH IT I BEAT DOWN FODDER FOR MY FLOCKS   AND IN IT I FIND OTHER USES  
    GOD  SAID    THROW IT  O MOSES    
   HE THREW IT  AND BEHOLD   IT WAS A SNAKE  ACTIVE IN MOTION 
    GOD  SAID    SEIZE IT  AND FEAR NOT   WE SHALL RETURN IT AT ONCE TO ITS FORMER CONDITION   
     NOW DRAW THY HAND CLOSE TO THY SIDE   IT SHALL COME FORTH WHITE  AND SHINING   WITHOUT HARM  OR STAIN   AS ANOTHER SIGN  
     IN ORDER THAT WE MAY SHOW THEE  TWO  OF OUR GREATER SIGNS 
     GO THOU TO PHARAOH  FOR HE HAS INDEED TRANSGRESSED ALL BOUNDS  SECTION  
    MOSES  SAID     O MY LORD   EXPAND ME MY BREAST  
     EASE MY TASK FOR ME  
     AND REMOVE THE IMPEDIMENT FROM MY SPEECH 
     SO THEY MAY UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAY  
     AND GIVE ME A MINISTER FROM MY FAMILY 
     AARON  MY BROTHER  
     ADD TO MY STRENGTH THROUGH HIM 
     AND MAKE HIM SHARE MY TASK  
     THAT WE MAY CELEBRATE THY PRAISE WITHOUT STINT 
     AND REMEMBER THEE WITHOUT STINT  
     FOR THOU ART HE THAT  EVER  REGARDETH US  
    GOD  SAID     GRANTED IS THY PRAYER  O MOSES    
     AND INDEED WE CONFERRED A FAVOUR ON THEE ANOTHER TIME  BEFORE  
     BEHOLD   WE SENT TO THY MOTHER  BY INSPIRATION  THE MESSAGE  
       THROW  THE CHILD  INTO THE CHEST  AND THROW  THE CHEST  INTO THE RIVER   THE RIVER WILL CAST HIM UP ON THE BANK  AND HE WILL BE TAKEN UP BY ONE WHO IS AN ENEMY TO ME AND AN ENEMY TO HIM     BUT I CAST  THE GARMENT OF  LOVE OVER THEE FROM ME   AND  THIS  IN ORDER THAT THOU MAYEST BE REARED UNDER MINE EYE 
     BEHOLD   THY SISTER GOETH FORTH AND SAITH    SHALL I SHOW YOU ONE WHO WILL NURSE AND REAR THE  CHILD      SO WE BROUGHT THEE BACK TO THY MOTHER  THAT HER EYE MIGHT BE COOLED AND SHE SHOULD NOT GRIEVE  THEN THOU DIDST SLAY A MAN  BUT WE SAVED THEE FROM TROUBLE  AND WE TIRED THEE IN VARIOUS WAYS  THEN DIDST THOU TARRY A NUMBER OF YEARS WITH THE PEOPLE OF MIDIAN  THEN DIDST THOU COME HITHER AS ORDAINED  O MOSES  
     AND I HAVE PREPARED THEE FOR MYSELF  FOR SERVICE    
     GO  THOU AND THY BROTHER  WITH MY SIGNS  AND SLACKEN NOT  EITHER OF YOU  IN KEEPING ME IN REMEMBRANCE 
     GO  BOTH OF YOU  TO PHARAOH  FOR HE HAS INDEED TRANSGRESSED ALL BOUNDS  
     BUT SPEAK TO HIM MILDLY   PERCHANCE HE MAY TAKE WARNING OR FEAR  GOD   
   THEY  MOSES AND AARON  SAID     OUR LORD   WE FEAR LEST HE HASTEN WITH INSOLENCE AGAINST US  OR LEST HE TRANSGRESS ALL BOUNDS  
   HE SAID     FEAR NOT   FOR I AM WITH YOU   I HEAR AND SEE  EVERYTHING  
     SO GO YE BOTH TO HIM  AND SAY    VERILY WE ARE APOSTLES SENT BY THY LORD   SEND FORTH  THEREFORE  THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WITH US  AND AFFLICT THEM NOT   WITH A SIGN  INDEED  HAVE WE COME FROM THY LORD   AND PEACE TO ALL WHO FOLLOW GUIDANCE  
       VERILY IT HAS BEEN REVEALED TO US THAT THE PENALTY  AWAITS  THOSE WHO REJECT AND TURN AWAY    
    WHEN THIS MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED    PHARAOH  SAID     WHO  THEN  O MOSES  IS THE LORD OF YOU TWO    
   HE SAID     OUR LORD IS HE WHO GAVE TO EACH  CREATED  THING ITS FORM AND NATURE  AND FURTHER  GAVE  IT  GUIDANCE  
    PHARAOH  SAID     WHAT THEN IS THE CONDITION OF PREVIOUS GENERATIONS    
   HE REPLIED     THE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT IS WITH MY LORD  DULY RECORDED   MY LORD NEVER ERRS  NOR FORGETS  
     HE WHO HAS MADE FOR YOU THE EARTH LIKE A CARPET SPREAD OUT   HAS ENABLED YOU TO GO ABOUT THEREIN BY ROADS  AND CHANNELS    AND HAS SENT DOWN WATER FROM THE SKY   WITH IT HAVE WE PRODUCED DIVERS PAIRS OF PLANTS EACH SEPARATE FROM THE OTHERS 
   EAT  FOR YOURSELVES  AND PASTURE YOUR CATTLE   VERILY  IN THIS ARE SIGNS FOR MEN ENDUED WITH UNDERSTANDING SECTION  
   FROM THE  EARTH  DID WE CREATE YOU  AND INTO IT SHALL WE RETURN YOU  AND FROM IT SHALL WE BRING YOU OUT ONCE AGAIN 
   AND WE SHOWED PHARAOH ALL OUR SIGNS  BUT HE DID REJECT AND REFUSE 
   HE SAID     HAST THOU COME TO DRIVE US OUT OF OUR LAND WITH THY MAGIC  O MOSES  
     BUT WE CAN SURELY PRODUCE MAGIC TO MATCH THINE   SO MAKE A TRYST BETWEEN US AND THEE  WHICH WE SHALL NOT FAIL TO KEEP NEITHER WE NOR THOU  IN A PLACE WHERE BOTH SHALL HAVE EVEN CHANCES  
   MOSES SAID     YOUR TRYST IS THE DAY OF THE FESTIVAL  AND LET THE PEOPLE BE ASSEMBLED WHEN THE SUN IS WELL UP  
   SO PHARAOH WITHDREW   HE CONCERTED HIS PLAN  AND THEN CAME  BACK  
   MOSES SAID TO HIM     WOE TO YOU   FORGE NOT YE A LIE AGAINST GOD  LEST HE DESTROY YOU  AT ONCE  UTTERLY BY CHASTISEMENT   THE FORGER MUST SUFFER FRUSTRATION    
   SO THEY DISPUTED  ONE WITH ANOTHER  OVER THEIR AFFAIR  BUT THEY KEPT THEIR TALK SECRET 
   THEY SAID     THESE TWO ARE CERTAINLY  EXPERT  MAGICIANS   THEIR OBJECT IS TO DRIVE YOU OUT FROM YOUR LAND WITH THEIR MAGIC  AND TO DO AWAY WITH YOUR MOST CHERISHED INSTITUTIONS 
     THEREFORE CONCERT YOUR PLAN  AND THEN ASSEMBLE IN  SERRIED  RANK S  HE WINS  ALL ALONG  TO DAY WHO GAINS THE UPPER HAND  
   THEY SAID     O MOSES   WHETHER WILT THOU THAT THOU THROW  FIRST  OR THAT WE BE THE FIRST TO THROW    
   HE SAID    NAY  THROW YE FIRST     THEN BEHOLD THEIR ROPES AND THEIR RODS  SO IT SEEMED TO HIM ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR MAGIC  BEGAN TO BE IN LIVELY MOTION  
   SO MOSES CONCEIVED IN HIS MIND A  SORT OF  FEAR 
   WE SAID     FEAR NOT   FOR THOU HAST INDEED THE UPPER HAND  
     THROW THAT WHICH IS IN THY RIGHT HAND   QUICKLY WILL IT SWALLOW UP THAT WHICH THEY HAVE FAKED  WHAT THEY HAVE FAKED IS BUT A MAGICIAN S TRICK   AND THE MAGICIAN THRIVES NOT   NO MATTER  WHERE HE GOES  
   SO THE MAGICIANS WERE THROWN DOWN TO PROSTRATION   THEY SAID    WE BELIEVE IN THE LORD OF AARON AND MOSES   
    PHARAOH  SAID     BELIEVE YE IN HIM BEFORE I GIVE YOU PERMISSION   SURELY THIS MUST BE YOUR LEADER  WHO HAS TAUGHT YOU MAGIC   BE SURE I WILL CUT OFF YOUR HANDS AND FEET ON OPPOSITE SIDES  AND I WILL HAVE YOU CRUCIFIED ON TRUNKS OF PALM TREES   SO SHALL YE KNOW FOR CERTAIN  WHICH OF US CAN GIVE THE MORE SEVERE AND THE MORE LASTING PUNISHMENT    
   THEY SAID     NEVER SHALL WE REGARD THEE AS MORE THAN THE CLEAR SIGNS THAT HAVE COME TO US  OR THAN HIM WHO CREATED US   SO DECREE WHATEVER THOU DESIREST TO DECREE   FOR THOU CANST ONLY DECREE  TOUCHING  THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD 
     FOR US  WE HAVE BELIEVED IN OUR LORD   MAY HE FORGIVE US OUR FAULTS  AND THE MAGIC TO WHICH THOU DIDST COMPEL US   FOR GOD IS BEST AND MOST ABIDING  
   VERILY HE WHO COMES TO HIS LORD AS A SINNER  AT JUDGMENT   FOR HIM IS HELL   THEREIN SHALL HE NEITHER DIE NOR LIVE 
   BUT SUCH AS COMES TO HIM AS BELIEVERS WHO HAVE WORKED RIGHTEOUS DEEDS   FOR THEM ARE RANKS EXALTED  
   GARDENS OF ETERNITY  BENEATH WHICH FLOW RIVERS   THEY WILL DWELL THEREIN FOR AYE   SUCH IS THE REWARD OF THOSE WHO PURIFY THEMSELVES  FROM EVIL  SECTION  
   WE SENT AN INSPIRATION TO MOSES     TRAVEL BY NIGHT WITH MY SERVANTS  AND STRIKE A DRY PATH FOR THEM THROUGH THE SEA  WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING OVERTAKEN  BY PHARAOH  AND WITHOUT  ANY OTHER  FEAR  
   THEN PHARAOH PURSUED THEM WITH HIS FORCES  BUT THE WATERS COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED THEM AND COVERED THEM UP 
   PHARAOH LED HIS PEOPLE ASTRAY INSTEAD OF LEADING THEM ARIGHT 
   O YE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL   WE DELIVERED YOU FROM YOUR ENEMY  AND WE MADE A COVENANT WITH YOU ON THE SIDE OF MOUNT  SINAI   AND WE SENT DOWN TO YOU MANNA AND QUAILS  
    SAYING      EAT OF THE GOOD THINGS WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR YOUR SUSTENANCE  BUT COMMIT NO EXCESS THEREIN  LEST MY WRATH SHOULD JUSTLY DESCEND ON YOU   AND THOSE ON WHOM DESCENDS MY WRATH DO PERISH INDEED  
     BUT  WITHOUT DOUBT  I AM  ALSO  HE THAT FORGIVES AGAIN AND AGAIN  TO THOSE WHO REPENT  BELIEVE  AND DO RIGHT  WHO  IN FINE  ARE READY TO RECEIVE TRUE GUIDANCE  
    WHEN MOSES WAS UP ON THE MOUNT  GOD SAID &COLON     WHAT MADE THEE HASTEN IN ADVANCE OF THY PEOPLE  O MOSES    
   HE REPLIED     BEHOLD  THEY ARE CLOSE ON MY FOOTSTEPS   I HASTENED TO THEE  O MY LORD  TO PLEASE THEE  
    GOD  SAID     WE HAVE TESTED THY PEOPLE IN THY ABSENCE   THE SĀMIRĪ HAS LED THEM ASTRAY  
   SO MOSES RETURNED TO HIS PEOPLE IN A STATE OF INDIGNATION AND SORROW  HE SAID     O MY PEOPLE   DID NOT YOUR LORD MAKE A HANDSOME PROMISE TO YOU   DID THEN THE PROMISE SEEM TO YOU LONG  IN COMING    OR DID YE DESIRE THAT WRATH SHOULD DESCEND FROM YOUR LORD ON YOU  AND SO YE BROKE YOUR PROMISE TO ME    
   THEY SAID     WE BROKE NOT THE PROMISE TO THEE  AS FAR AS LAY IN OUR POWER   BUT WE WERE MADE TO CARRY THE WEIGHT OF THE ORNAMENTS OF THE  WHOLE  PEOPLE  AND WE THREW THEM  INTO THE FIRE   AND THAT WAS WHAT THE SĀMIRĪ SUGGESTED 
     THEN HE BROUGHT OUT  OF THE FIRE  BEFORE THE  PEOPLE  THE IMAGE OF A CALF   IT SEEMED TO LOW   SO THEY SAID     THIS IS YOUR GOD  AND THE GOD OF MOSES  BUT  MOSES  HAS FORGOTTEN      
   COULD THEY NOT SEE THAT IT COULD NOT RETURN THEM A WORD  FOR ANSWER   AND THAT IT HAD NO POWER EITHER TO HARM THEM OR TO DO THEM GOOD  SECTION  
   AARON HAD ALREADY  BEFORE THIS  SAID TO THEM     O MY PEOPLE   YE ARE BEING TESTED IN THIS   FOR VERILY YOUR LORD IS  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS   SO FOLLOW ME AND OBEY MY COMMAND  
   THEY HAD SAID     WE WILL NOT ABANDON THIS CULT  BUT WE WILL DEVOTE OURSELVES TO IT UNTIL MOSES RETURNS TO US  
    MOSES  SAID     O AARON   WHAT KEPT THEE BACK  WHEN THOU SAWEST THEM GOING WRONG 
     FROM FOLLOWING ME   DIDST THOU THEN DISOBEY MY ORDER    
    AARON  REPLIED     O SON OF MY MOTHER   SEIZE  ME NOT  BY MY BEARD NOR BY  THE HAIR OF  MY HEAD   TRULY I FEARED LEST THOU SHOULDST SAY    THOU HAST CAUSED A DIVISION AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL  AND THOU DIDST NOT RESPECT MY WORD      
    MOSES  SAID     WHAT THEN IS THY CASE  O SĀMIRĪ    
   HE REPLIED     I SAW WHAT THEY SAW NOT   SO I TOOK A HANDFUL  OF DUST  FROM THE FOOTPRINT OF THE APOSTLE  AND THREW IT  INTO THE CALF    THUS DID MY SOUL SUGGEST TO ME  
    MOSES  SAID     GET THEE GONE   BUT THY  PUNISHMENT  IN THIS LIFE WILL BE THAT THOU WILT SAY    TOUCH ME NOT     AND MOREOVER  FOR A FUTURE PENALTY  THOU HAST A PROMISE THAT WILL NOT FAIL   NOW LOOK AT THY GOD  OF WHOM THOU HAST BECOME A DEVOTED WORSHIPPER   WE WILL CERTAINLY  MELT  IT IN A BLAZING FIRE AND SCATTER IT BROADCAST IN THE SEA    
   BUT THE GOD OF YOU ALL IS THE ONE GOD   THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE   ALL THINGS HE COMPREHENDS IN HIS KNOWLEDGE 
   THUS DO WE RELATE TO THEE SOME STORIES OF WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE   FOR WE HAVE SENT THEE A MESSAGE FROM OUR OWN PRESENCE 
   IF ANY DO TURN AWAY THEREFROM  VERILY THEY WILL BEAR A BURDEN ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT  
   THEY WILL ABIDE IN THIS  STATE    AND GRIEVOUS WILL THE BURDEN BE TO THEM ON THAT DAY  
   THE DAY WHEN THE TRUMPET WILL BE SOUNDED   THAT DAY  WE SHALL GATHER THE SINFUL  BLEAR EYED  WITH TERROR  
   IN WHISPERS WILL THEY CONSULT EACH OTHER     YE TARRIED NOT LONGER THAN TEN  DAYS     
   WE KNOW BEST WHAT THEY WILL SAY  WHEN THEIR LEADER MOST EMINENT IN CONDUCT WILL SAY     YE TARRIED NOT LONGER THAN A DAY    SECTION  
   THEY ASK THEE CONCERNING THE MOUNTAINS   SAY    MY LORD WILL UPROOT THEM AND SCATTER THEM AS DUST  
     HE WILL LEAVE THEM AS PLAINS SMOOTH AND LEVEL  
     NOTHING CROOKED OR CURVED WILT THOU SEE IN THEIR PLACE  
   ON THAT DAY WILL THEY FOLLOW THE CALLER  STRAIGHT    NO CROOKEDNESS  CAN THEY SHOW  HIM   ALL SOUNDS SHALL HUMBLE THEMSELVES IN THE PRESENCE OF  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS   NOTHING SHALT THOU HEAR BUT THE TRAMP OF THEIR FEET  AS THEY MARCH  
   ON THAT DAY SHALL NO INTERCESSION AVAIL EXCEPT FOR THOSE FOR WHOM PERMISSION HAS BEEN GRANTED BY  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS AND WHOSE WORD IS ACCEPTABLE TO HIM 
   HE KNOWS WHAT  APPEARS TO HIS CREATURES AS  BEFORE OR AFTER OR BEHIND THEM   BUT THEY SHALL NOT COMPASS IT WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE 
    ALL  FACES SHALL BE HUMBLED BEFORE  HIM  THE LIVING  THE SELF SUBSISTING  ETERNAL   HOPELESS INDEED WILL BE THE MAN THAT CARRIES INIQUITY  ON HIS BACK  
   BUT HE WHO WORKS DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  AND HAS FAITH  WILL HAVE NO FEAR OF HARM NOR OF ANY CURTAILMENT  OF WHAT IS HIS DUE  
   THUS HAVE WE SENT THIS DOWN AN ARABIC QUR ĀN AND EXPLAINED THEREIN IN DETAIL SOME OF THE WARNINGS  IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY FEAR GOD  OR THAT IT MAY CAUSE THEIR REMEMBRANCE  OF HIM  
   HIGH ABOVE ALL IS GOD  THE KING  THE TRUTH   BE NOT IN HASTE WITH THE QUR ĀN BEFORE ITS REVELATION TO THEE IS COMPLETED  BUT SAY    O MY LORD   ADVANCE ME IN KNOWLEDGE  
   WE HAD ALREADY  BEFOREHAND  TAKEN THE COVENANT OF ADAM  BUT HE FORGOT   AND WE FOUND ON HIS PART NO FIRM RESOLVE SECTION  
   WHEN WE SAID TO THE ANGELS    PROSTRATE YOURSELVES TO ADAM    THEY PROSTRATED THEMSELVES  BUT NOT IBLĪS   HE REFUSED 
   THEN WE SAID     O ADAM   VERILY  THIS IS AN ENEMY TO THEE AND THY WIFE   SO LET HIM NOT GET YOU BOTH OUT OF THE GARDEN  SO THAT THOU ART LANDED IN MISERY 
     THERE IS THEREIN  ENOUGH PROVISION  FOR THEE NOT TO GO HUNGRY NOR TO GO NAKED 
     NOR TO SUFFER FROM THIRST  NOR FROM THE SUN S HEAT  
   BUT SATAN WHISPERED EVIL TO HIM   HE SAID    O ADAM   SHALL I LEAD THEE TO THE TREE OF ETERNITY AND TO A KINGDOM THAT NEVER DECAYS    
   IN THE RESULT  THEY BOTH ATE OF THE TREE  AND SO THEIR NAKEDNESS APPEARED TO THEM   THEY BEGAN TO SEW TOGETHER  FOR THEIR COVERING  LEAVES FROM THE GARDEN   THUS DID ADAM DISOBEY HIS LORD  AND ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE SEDUCED 
   BUT HIS LORD CHOSE HIM  FOR HIS GRACE    HE TURNED TO HIM  AND GAVE HIM GUIDANCE 
   HE SAID     GET YE DOWN  BOTH OF YOU  ALL TOGETHER  FROM THE GARDEN  WITH ENMITY ONE TO ANOTHER   BUT IF  AS IS SURE  THERE COMES TO YOU GUIDANCE FROM ME  WHOSOEVER FOLLOWS MY GUIDANCE  WILL NOT LOSE HIS WAY  NOR FALL INTO MISERY 
     BUT WHOSOEVER TURNS AWAY FROM MY MESSAGE  VERILY FOR HIM IS A LIFE NARROWED DOWN  AND WE SHALL RAISE HIM UP BLIND ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  
   HE WILL SAY     O MY LORD   WHY HAST THOU RAISED ME UP BLIND  WHILE I HAD SIGHT  BEFORE     
    GOD  WILL SAY     THUS DIDST THOU  WHEN OUR SIGNS CAME UNTO THEE  DISREGARD THEM   SO WILT THOU  THIS DAY  BE DISREGARDED  
   AND THUS DO WE RECOMPENSE HIM WHO TRANSGRESSES BEYOND BOUNDS AND BELIEVES NOT IN THE SIGNS OF HIS LORD   AND THE PENALTY OF THE HEREAFTER IS FAR MORE GRIEVOUS AND MORE ENDURING 
   IT IS NOT A WARNING TO SUCH MEN  TO CALL TO MIND  HOW MANY GENERATIONS BEFORE THEM WE DESTROYED  IN WHOSE HAUNTS THEY  NOW  MOVE   VERILY  IN THIS ARE SIGNS FOR MEN ENDUED WITH UNDERSTANDING SECTION  
   HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR A WORD THAT WENT FORTH BEFORE FROM THY LORD   THEIR PUNISHMENT  MUST NECESSARILY HAVE COME   BUT THERE IS A TERM APPOINTED  FOR RESPITE  
   THEREFORE BE PATIENT WITH WHAT THEY SAY  AND CELEBRATE  CONSTANTLY  THE PRAISES OF THY LORD  BEFORE THE RISING OF THE SUN  AND BEFORE ITS SETTING   YEA  CELEBRATE THEM FOR PART OF THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT  AND AT THE SIDES OF THE DAY   THAT THOU MAYEST HAVE  SPIRITUAL  JOY 
   NOR STRAIN THINE EYES IN LONGING FOR THE THINGS WE HAVE GIVEN FOR ENJOYMENT TO PARTIES OF THEM  THE SPLENDOUR OF THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD  THROUGH WHICH WE TEST THEM   BUT THE PROVISION OF THY LORD IS BETTER AND MORE ENDURING 
   ENJOIN PRAYER ON THY PEOPLE  AND BE CONSTANT THEREIN  WE ASK THEE NOT TO PROVIDE SUSTENANCE   WE PROVIDE IT FOR THEE  BUT THE  FRUIT OF  THE HEREAFTER IS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS 
   THEY SAY     WHY DOES HE NOT BRING US A SIGN FROM HIS LORD     HAS NOT A CLEAR SIGN COME TO THEM OF ALL THAT WAS IN THE FORMER BOOKS OF REVELATION  
   AND IF WE HAD INFLICTED ON THEM A PENALTY BEFORE THIS  THEY WOULD HAVE SAID     OUR LORD   IF ONLY THOU HADST SENT US AN APOSTLE  WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FOLLOWED THY SIGNS BEFORE WE WERE HUMBLED AND PUT TO SHAME  
   SAY     EACH ONE  OF US  IS WAITING   WAIT YE  THEREFORE  AND SOON SHALL YE KNOW WHO IT IS THAT IS ON THE STRAIGHT AND EVEN WAY  AND WHO IT IS THAT HAS RECEIVED GUIDANCE  
   CLOSER AND CLOSER TO MANKIND COMES THEIR RECKONING   YET THEY HEED NOT AND THEY TURN AWAY 
   NEVER COMES  AUGHT  TO THEM OF A RENEWED MESSAGE FROM THEIR LORD  BUT THEY LISTEN TO IT AS IN JEST  
   THEIR HEARTS TOYING AS WITH TRIFLES  THE WRONG DOERS CONCEAL THEIR PRIVATE COUNSELS   SAYING     IS THIS  ONE  MORE THAN A MAN LIKE YOURSELVES   WILL YE GO TO WITCHCRAFT WITH YOUR EYES OPEN    
   SAY     MY LORD KNOWETH  EVERY  WORD  SPOKEN  IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   HE IS THE ONE THAT HEARETH AND KNOWETH  ALL THINGS   
     NAY   THEY SAY     THESE ARE  MEDLEYS OF DREAMS   NAY  HE FORGED IT   NAY  HE IS  BUT  A POET   LET HIM THEN BRING US A SIGN LIKE THE ONES THAT WERE SENT TO  PROPHETS  OF OLD    
    AS TO THOSE  BEFORE THEM  NOT ONE OF THE POPULATIONS WHICH WE DESTROYED BELIEVED   WILL THESE BELIEVE  
   BEFORE THEE  ALSO  THE APOSTLES WE SENT WERE BUT MEN  TO WHOM WE GRANTED INSPIRATION   IF YE REALISE THIS NOT  ASK OF THOSE WHO POSSESS THE MESSAGE 
   NOR DID WE GIVE THEM BODIES THAT ATE NO FOOD  NOR WERE THEY EXEMPT FROM DEATH 
   IN THE END WE FULFILLED TO THEM OUR PROMISE  AND WE SAVED THEM AND THOSE WHOM WE PLEASED  BUT WE DESTROYED THOSE WHO TRANSGRESSED BEYOND BOUNDS 
   WE HAVE REVEALED FOR YOU  O MEN    A BOOK IN WHICH IS A MESSAGE FOR YOU   WILL YE NOT THEN UNDERSTAND  SECTION  
   HOW MANY WERE THE POPULATIONS WE UTTERLY DESTROYED BECAUSE OF THEIR INIQUITIES  SETTING UP IN THEIR PLACES OTHER PEOPLES  
   YET  WHEN THEY FELT OUR PUNISHMENT  COMING   BEHOLD  THEY  TRIED TO  FLEE FROM IT 
   FLEE NOT  BUT RETURN TO THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS LIFE WHICH WERE GIVEN YOU  AND TO YOUR HOMES  IN ORDER THAT YE MAY BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT 
   THEY SAID     AH   WOE TO US   WE WERE INDEED WRONG DOERS    
   AND THAT CRY OF THEIRS CEASED NOT  TILL WE MADE THEM AS A FIELD THAT IS MOWN  AS ASHES SILENT AND QUENCHED 
   NOT FOR  IDLE  SPORT DID WE CREATE THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL THAT IS BETWEEN  
   IF IT HAD BEEN OUR WISH TO TAKE  JUST  A PASTIME  WE SHOULD SURELY HAVE TAKEN IT FROM THE THINGS NEAREST TO US  IF WE WOULD DO  SUCH A THING   
   NAY  WE HURL THE TRUTH AGAINST FALSEHOOD  AND IT KNOCKS OUT ITS BRAIN  AND BEHOLD  FALSEHOOD DOTH PERISH   AH   WOE BE TO YOU FOR THE  FALSE  THINGS YE ASCRIBE  TO US  
   TO HIM BELONG ALL  CREATURES  IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   EVEN THOSE WHO ARE IN HIS  VERY  PRESENCE ARE NOT TOO PROUD TO SERVE HIM  NOR ARE THEY  EVER  WEARY  OF HIS SERVICE   
   THEY CELEBRATE HIS PRAISES NIGHT AND DAY  NOR DO THEY EVER FLAG OR INTERMIT 
   OR HAVE THEY TAKEN  FOR WORSHIP  GODS FROM THE EARTH WHO CAN RAISE  THE DEAD   
   IF THERE WERE  IN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  OTHER GODS BESIDES GOD  THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONFUSION IN BOTH   BUT GLORY TO GOD  THE LORD OF THE THRONE    HIGH IS HE  ABOVE WHAT THEY ATTRIBUTE TO HIM  
   HE CANNOT BE QUESTIONED FOR HIS ACTS  BUT THEY WILL BE QUESTIONED  FOR THEIRS  
   OR HAVE THEY TAKEN FOR WORSHIP  OTHER  GODS BESIDES HIM   SAY    BRING YOUR CONVINCING PROOF   THIS IS THE MESSAGE OF THOSE WITH ME AND THE MESSAGE OF THOSE BEFORE ME   BUT MOST OF THEM KNOW NOT THE TRUTH  AND SO TURN AWAY 
   NOT AN APOSTLE DID WE SEND BEFORE THEE WITHOUT THIS INSPIRATION SENT BY US TO HIM   THAT THERE IS NO GOD BUT I   THEREFORE WORSHIP AND SERVE ME 
   AND THEY SAY      GOD  MOST GRACIOUS HAS BEGOTTEN OFFSPRING   GLORY TO HIM   THEY ARE  BUT  SERVANTS RAISED TO HONOUR 
   THEY SPEAK NOT BEFORE HE SPEAKS  AND THEY ACT  IN ALL THINGS  BY HIS COMMAND 
   HE KNOWS WHAT IS BEFORE THEM  AND WHAT IS BEHIND THEM  AND THEY OFFER NO INTERCESSION EXCEPT FOR THOSE WHO ARE ACCEPTABLE  AND THEY STAND IN AWE AND REVERENCE OF HIS  GLORY  
   IF ANY OF THEM SHOULD SAY    I AM A GOD BESIDES HIM    SUCH A ONE WE SHOULD REWARD WITH HELL   THUS DO WE REWARD THOSE WHO DO WRONG SECTION  
   DO NOT THE UNBELIEVERS SEE THAT THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH WERE JOINED TOGETHER  AS ONE UNIT OF CREATION   BEFORE WE CLOVE THEM ASUNDER   WE MADE FROM WATER EVERY LIVING THING  WILL THEY NOT THEN BELIEVE  
   AND WE HAVE SET ON THE EARTH MOUNTAINS STANDING FIRM  LEST IT SHOULD SHAKE WITH THEM  AND WE HAVE MADE THEREIN BROAD HIGHWAYS  BETWEEN MOUNTAINS  FOR THEM TO PASS THROUGH   THAT THEY MAY RECEIVE GUIDANCE 
   AND WE HAVE MADE THE HEAVENS AS A CANOPY WELL GUARDED   YET DO THEY TURN AWAY FROM THE SIGNS WHICH THESE THINGS  POINT TO   
   IT IS HE WHO CREATED THE NIGHT AND THE DAY  AND THE SUN AND THE MOON   ALL  THE CELESTIAL BODIES  SWIM ALONG  EACH IN ITS ROUNDED COURSE 
   WE GRANTED NOT TO ANY MAN BEFORE THEE PERMANENT LIFE  HERE    IF THEN THOU SHOULDST DIE  WOULD THEY LIVE PERMANENTLY  
   EVERY SOUL SHALL HAVE A TASTE OF DEATH   AND WE TEST YOU BY EVIL AND BY GOOD BY WAY OF TRIAL  TO US MUST YE RETURN 
   WHEN THE UNBELIEVERS SEE THEE  THEY TREAT THEE NOT EXCEPT WITH RIDICULE    IS THIS    THEY SAY     THE ONE WHO TALKS OF YOUR GODS     AND THEY BLASPHEME AT THE MENTION OF  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  
   MAN IS A CREATURE OF HASTE   SOON  ENOUGH  WILL I SHOW YOU MY SIGNS   THEN YE WILL NOT ASK ME TO HASTEN THEM  
   THEY SAY     WHEN WILL THIS PROMISE COME TO PASS  IF YE ARE TELLING THE TRUTH    
   IF ONLY THE UNBELIEVERS KNEW  THE TIME  WHEN THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WARD OFF THE FIRE FROM THEIR FACES  NOR YET FROM THEIR BACKS  AND  WHEN  NO HELP CAN REACH THEM  
   NAY  IT MAY COME TO THEM ALL OF A SUDDEN AND CONFOUND THEM   NO POWER WILL THEY HAVE THEN TO AVERT IT  NOR WILL THEY  THEN  GET RESPITE 
   MOCKED WERE  MANY  APOSTLES BEFORE THEE   BUT THEIR SCOFFERS WERE HEMMED IN BY THE THING THAT THEY MOCKED SECTION  
   SAY    WHO CAN KEEP YOU SAFE BY NIGHT AND BY DAY FROM  THE WRATH OF   GOD  MOST GRACIOUS     YET THEY TURN AWAY FROM THE MENTION OF THEIR LORD 
   OR HAVE THEY GODS THAT CAN GUARD THEM FROM US   THEY HAVE NO POWER TO AID THEMSELVES  NOR CAN THEY BE DEFENDED FROM US 
   NAY  WE GAVE THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS LIFE TO THESE MEN AND THEIR FATHERS UNTIL THE PERIOD GREW LONG FOR THEM   SEE THEY NOT THAT WE GRADUALLY REDUCE THE LAND  IN THEIR CONTROL  FROM ITS OUTLYING BORDERS   IS IT THEN THEY WHO WILL WIN  
   SAY    I DO BUT WARN YOU ACCORDING TO REVELATION     BUT THE DEAF WILL NOT HEAR THE CALL   EVEN  WHEN THEY ARE WARNED  
   IF BUT A BREATH OF THE WRATH OF THY LORD DO TOUCH THEM  THEY WILL THEN SAY    WOE TO US   WE DID WRONG INDEED    
   WE SHALL SET UP SCALES OF JUSTICE FOR THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  SO THAT NOT A SOUL WILL BE DEALT WITH UNJUSTLY IN THE LEAST  AND IF THERE BE  NO MORE THAN  THE WEIGHT OF A MUSTARD SEED  WE WILL BRING IT  TO ACCOUNT    AND ENOUGH ARE WE TO TAKE ACCOUNT 
   IN THE PAST WE GRANTED TO MOSES AND AARON THE CRITERION  FOR JUDGMENT   AND A LIGHT AND A MESSAGE FOR THOSE WHO WOULD DO RIGHT  
   THOSE WHO FEAR THEIR LORD IN THEIR MOST SECRET THOUGHTS  AND WHO HOLD THE HOUR  OF JUDGMENT  IN AWE 
   AND THIS IS A BLESSED MESSAGE WHICH WE HAVE SENT DOWN   WILL YE THEN REJECT IT  SECTION  
   WE BESTOWED AFORETIME ON ABRAHAM HIS RECTITUDE OF CONDUCT  AND WELL WERE WE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM 
   BEHOLD   HE SAID TO HIS FATHER AND HIS PEOPLE    WHAT ARE THESE IMAGES  TO WHICH YE ARE  SO ASSIDUOUSLY  DEVOTED    
   THEY SAID    WE FOUND OUR FATHERS WORSHIPPING THEM  
   HE SAID    INDEED YE HAVE BEEN IN MANIFEST ERROR YE AND YOUR FATHERS  
   THEY SAID    HAVE YOU BROUGHT US THE TRUTH  OR ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE WHO JEST    
   HE SAID    NAY  YOUR LORD IS THE LORD OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  HE WHO CREATED THEM  FROM NOTHING    AND I AM A WITNESS TO THIS  TRUTH  
     AND BY GOD  I HAVE A PLAN FOR YOUR IDOLS  AFTER YE GO AWAY AND TURN YOUR BACKS   
   SO HE BROKE THEM TO PIECES   ALL  BUT THE BIGGEST OF THEM  THAT THEY MIGHT TURN  AND ADDRESS THEMSELVES  TO IT 
   THEY SAID    WHO HAS DONE THIS TO OUR GODS   HE MUST INDEED BE SOME MAN OF IMPIETY    
   THEY SAID    WE HEARD A YOUTH TALK OF THEM   HE IS CALLED ABRAHAM  
   THEY SAID    THEN BRING HIM BEFORE THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE  THAT THEY MAY BEAR WITNESS    
   THEY SAID    ART THOU THE ONE THAT DID THIS WITH OUR GODS  O ABRAHAM    
   HE SAID     NAY  THIS WAS DONE BY  THIS IS THEIR IS THEIR BIGGEST ONE   ASK THEM  IF THEY CAN SPEAK INTELLIGENTLY    
   SO THEY TURNED TO THEMSELVES AND SAID    SURELY YE ARE THE ONES IN THE WRONG    
   THEN WERE THEY CONFOUNDED WITH SHAME    THEY SAID     THOU KNOWEST FULL WELL THAT THESE  IDOLS  DO NOT SPEAK    
    ABRAHAM  SAID    DO YE THEN WORSHIP  BESIDES GOD  THINGS THAT CAN NEITHER BE OF ANY GOOD TO YOU NOR DO YOU HARM  
     FIE UPON YOU  AND UPON THE THINGS THAT YE WORSHIP BESIDES GOD   HAVE YE NO SENSE     
   THEY SAID    BURN HIM AND PROTECT YOUR GODS  IF YE DO  ANYTHING AT ALL     
   WE SAID    O FIRE   BE THOU COOL  AND  A MEANS OF  SAFETY FOR ABRAHAM    
   THEN THEY SOUGHT A STRATAGEM AGAINST HIM   BUT WE MADE THEM THE ONES THAT LOST MOST  
   BUT WE DELIVERED HIM AND  HIS NEPHEW  LŪṬ  AND DIRECTED THEM  TO THE LAND WHICH WE HAVE BLESSED FOR THE NATIONS 
   AND WE BESTOWED ON HIM ISAAC AND  AS AN ADDITIONAL GIFT   A GRANDSON   JACOB  AND WE MADE RIGHTEOUS MEN OF EVERY ONE  OF THEM  
   AND WE MADE THEM LEADERS  GUIDING  MEN  BY OUR COMMAND  AND WE SENT THEM INSPIRATION TO DO GOOD DEEDS  TO ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS  AND TO PRACTICE REGULAR CHARITY   AND THEY CONSTANTLY SERVED US  AND US ONLY  
   AND TO LŪṬ  TOO  WE GAVE JUDGMENT AND KNOWLEDGE  AND WE SAVED HIM FROM THE TOWN WHICH PRACTICED ABOMINATIONS   TRULY THEY WERE A PEOPLE GIVEN TO EVIL  A REBELLIOUS PEOPLE 
   AND WE ADMITTED HIM TO OUR MERCY   FOR HE WAS ONE OF THE RIGHTEOUS SECTION  
    REMEMBER  NOAH  WHEN HE CRIED  TO US  AFORETIME   WE LISTENED TO HIS  PRAYER  AND DELIVERED HIM AND HIS FAMILY FROM GREAT DISTRESS 
   WE HELPED HIM AGAINST PEOPLE WHO REJECTED OUR SIGNS   TRULY THEY WERE A PEOPLE GIVEN TO EVIL   SO WE DROWNED THEM  IN THE FLOOD  ALL TOGETHER 
   AND REMEMBER DAVID AND SOLOMON  WHEN THEY GAVE JUDGMENT IN THE MATTER OF THE FIELD INTO WHICH THE SHEEP OF CERTAIN PEOPLE HAD STRAYED BY NIGHT   WE DID WITNESS THEIR JUDGMENT 
   TO SOLOMON WE INSPIRED THE  RIGHT  UNDERSTANDING OF THE MATTER   TO EACH  OF THEM  WE GAVE JUDGMENT AND KNOWLEDGE   IT WAS OUR POWER THAT MADE THE HILLS AND THE BIRDS CELEBRATE OUR PRAISES  WITH DAVID   IT WAS WE WHO DID  ALL THESE THINGS  
   IT WAS WE WHO TAUGHT HIM THE MAKING OF COATS OF MAIL FOR YOUR BENEFIT  TO GUARD YOU FROM EACH OTHER S VIOLENCE   WILL YE THEN BE GRATEFUL  
    IT WAS OUR POWER THAT MADE  THE VIOLENT  UNRULY  WIND FLOW  TAMELY  FOR SOLOMON  TO HIS ORDER  TO THE LAND WHICH WE HAD BLESSED   FOR WE DO KNOW ALL THINGS 
   AND OF THE EVIL ONES  WERE SOME WHO DIVED FOR HIM  AND DID OTHER WORK BESIDES   AND LIT WAS WE WHO GUARDED THEM 
   AND  REMEMBER  JOB  WHEN HE CRIED TO HIS LORD    TRULY DISTRESS HAS SEIZED ME  BUT THOU ART THE MOST MERCIFUL OF THOSE THAT ARE MERCIFUL  
   SO WE LISTENED TO HIM   WE REMOVED THE DISTRESS THAT WAS ON HIM  AND WE RESTORED HIS PEOPLE TO HIM  AND DOUBLED THEIR NUMBER  AS A GRACE FROM OURSELVES  AND A THING FOR COMMEMORATION  FOR ALL WHO SERVE US 
   AND  REMEMBER  ISMĀ ĪL  IDRĪS  AND ẒUL KIFL  ALL  MEN  OF CONSTANCY AND PATIENCE  
   WE ADMITTED THEM TO OUR MERCY   FOR THEY WERE OF THE RIGHTEOUS ONES 
   AND REMEMBER ẒUN NŪN  WHEN HE DEPARTED IN WRATH   HE IMAGINED THAT WE HAD NO POWER OVER HIM   BUT HE CRIED THROUGH THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS    THERE IS NO GOD BUT THOU   GLORY TO THEE   I WAS INDEED WRONG    
   SO WE LISTENED TO HIM   AND DELIVERED HIM FROM DISTRESS   AND THUS DO WE DELIVER THOSE WHO HAVE FAITH 
   AND  REMEMBER  ZAKARĪYĀ  WHEN HE CRIED TO HIS LORD     O MY LORD   LEAVE ME NOT WITHOUT OFFSPRING  THOUGH THOU ART THE BEST OF INHERITORS  
   SO WE LISTENED TO HIM   AND WE GRANTED HIM YAḤYĀ   WE CURED HIS WIFE S  BARRENNESS  FOR HIM  THESE  THREE  WERE EVER QUICK IN EMULATION IN GOOD WORKS   THEY USED TO CALL ON US WITH LOVE AND REVERENCE  AND HUMBLE THEMSELVES BEFORE US 
   AND  REMEMBER  HER WHO GUARDED HER CHASTITY   WE BREATHED INTO HER OF OUR SPIRIT  AND WE MADE HER AND HER SON A SIGN FOR ALL PEOPLES 
   VERILY  THIS BROTHERHOOD OF YOURS IS A SINGLE BROTHERHOOD  AND I AM YOUR LORD AND CHERISHER   THEREFORE SERVE ME  AND NO OTHER  
   BUT  LATER GENERATIONS  CUT OFF THEIR AFFAIR  OF UNITY   ONE FROM ANOTHER    YET  WILL THEY ALL RETURN TO US SECTION  
   WHOEVER WORKS ANY ACT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HAS FAITH   HIS ENDEAVOUR WILL NOT BE REJECTED   WE SHALL RECORD IT IN HIS FAVOUR 
   BUT THERE IS A BAN ON ANY POPULATION WHICH WE HAVE DESTROYED   THAT THEY SHALL NOT RETURN 
   UNTIL THE GOG AND MAGOG  PEOPLE  ARE LET THROUGH  THEIR BARRIER   AND THEY SWIFTLY SWARM FROM EVERY HILL 
   THEN WILL THE TRUE PROMISE DRAW NIGH  OF FULFILMENT    THEN BEHOLD   THE EYES OF THE UNBELIEVERS WILL FIXEDLY STARE IN HORROR     AH   WOE TO US   WE WERE INDEED HEEDLESS OF THIS   NAY   WE TRULY DID WRONG    
   VERILY YE   UNBELIEVERS   AND THE  FALSE  GODS THAT YE WORSHIP BESIDES GOD  ARE  BUT  FUEL FOR HELL   TO IT WILL YE  SURELY  COME  
   IF THESE HAD BEEN GODS  THEY WOULD NOT HAVE GOT THERE   BUT EACH ONE WILL ABIDE THEREIN 
   THERE  SOBBING WILL BE THEIR LOT  NOR WILL THEY THERE HEAR  AUGHT ELSE  
   THOSE FOR WHOM THE GOOD  RECORD  FROM US HAS GONE BEFORE  WILL BE REMOVED FAR THEREFROM 
   NOT THE SLIGHTEST SOUND WILL THEY HEAR OF HELL   WHAT THEIR SOULS DESIRED  IN THAT WILL THEY DWELL 
   THE GREAT TERROR WILL BRING THEM NO GRIEF   BUT THE ANGELS WILL MEET THEM  WITH MUTUAL GREETINGS      THIS IS YOUR DAY    THE DAY  THAT YE WERE PROMISED  
   THE DAY THAT WE ROLL UP THE HEAVENS LIKE A SCROLL ROLLED UP FOR BOOKS  COMPLETED    EVEN AS WE PRODUCED THE FIRST CREATION  SO SHALL WE PRODUCE A NEW ONE   A PROMISE WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN   TRULY SHALL WE FULFIL IT 
   BEFORE THIS WE WROTE IN THE PSALMS  AFTER THE MESSAGE  GIVEN TO MOSES      MY SERVANTS  THE RIGHTEOUS  SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH  
   VERILY IN THE  QUR ĀN  IS A MESSAGE FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD  TRULY  WORSHIP GOD 
   WE SENT THEE NOT  BUT AS A MERCY FOR ALL CREATURES 
   SAY     WHAT HAS COME TO ME BY INSPIRATION IS THAT YOUR GOD IS ONE GOD   WILL YE THEREFORE BOW TO HIS WILL  IN ISLĀM     
   BUT IF THEY TURN BACK  SAY     I HAVE PROCLAIMED THE MESSAGE TO YOU ALL ALIKE AND IN TRUTH   BUT I KNOW NOT WHETHER THAT WHICH YE ARE PROMISED IS NEAR OR FAR 
     IT IS HE WHO KNOWS WHAT IS OPEN IN SPEECH AND WHAT YE HIDE  IN YOUR HEARTS  
     I KNOW NOT BUT THAT IT MAY BE A TRIAL FOR YOU  AND A GRANT OF  WORLDLY  LIVELIHOOD  TO YOU  FOR A TIME  
   SAY     O MY LORD   JUDGE THOU IN TRUTH       OUR LORD MOST GRACIOUS IS THE ONE WHOSE ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE SOUGHT AGAINST THE BLASPHEMIES YE UTTER    
   O MANKIND   FEAR YOUR LORD   FOR THE CONVULSION OF THE HOUR  OF JUDGMENT  WILL BE A THING TERRIBLE  
   THE DAY YE SHALL SEE IT  EVERY MOTHER GIVING SUCK SHALL FORGET HER SUCKLING BABE  AND EVERY PREGNANT FEMALE SHALL DROP HER LOAD  UNFORMED    THOU SHALT SEE MANKIND AS IN A DRUNKEN RIOT  YET NOT DRUNK   BUT DREADFUL WILL BE THE WRATH OF GOD 
   AND YET AMONG MEN THERE ARE SUCH AS DISPUTE ABOUT GOD  WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE  AND FOLLOW EVERY EVIL ONE OBSTINATE IN REBELLION  
   ABOUT THE  EVIL ONE  IT IS DECREED THAT WHOEVER TURNS TO HIM FOR FRIENDSHIP  HIM WILL HE LEAD ASTRAY  AND HE WILL GUIDE HIM TO THE PENALTY OF THE FIRE 
   O MANKIND   IF YE HAVE A DOUBT ABOUT THE RESURRECTION   CONSIDER  THAT WE CREATED YOU OUT OF DUST  THEN OUT OF SPERM  THEN OUT OF A LEECH LIKE CLOT  THEN OUT A MORSEL OF FLESH  PARTLY FORMED AND PARTLY UNFORMED  IN ORDER THAT WE MAY MANIFEST  OUR POWER  TO YOU   AND WE CAUSE WHOM WE WILL TO REST IN THE WOMBS FOR AN APPOINTED TERM  THEN DO WE BRING YOU OUT AS BABES  THEN  FOSTER YOU  THAT YE MAY REACH YOUR AGE OF FULL STRENGTH   AND SOME OF YOU ARE CALLED TO DIE  AND SOME ARE SENT BACK TO THE FEEBLEST OLD AGE  SO THAT THEY KNOW NOTHING AFTER HAVING KNOWN  MUCH   AND  FURTHER   THOU SEEST THE EARTH BARREN AND LIFELESS  BUT WHEN WE POUR DOWN RAIN ON IT  IT IS STIRRED  TO LIFE   IT SWELLS  AND IT PUTS FORTH EVERY KIND OF BEAUTIFUL GROWTH  IN PAIRS  
   THIS IS SO  BECAUSE GOD IS THE REALITY   IT IS HE WHO GIVES LIFE TO THE DEAD  AND IT IS HE WHO HAS POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   AND VERILY THE HOUR WILL COME   THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT  OR ABOUT  THE FACT  THAT GOD WILL RAISE UP ALL WHO ARE IN THE GRAVES 
   YET THERE IS AMONG MEN SUCH A ONE AS DISPUTES ABOUT GOD  WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE  WITHOUT GUIDANCE  AND WITHOUT A BOOK OF ENLIGHTENMENT  
    DISDAINFULLY  BENDING HIS SIDE  IN ORDER TO LEAD  MEN  ASTRAY FROM THE PATH OF GOD   FOR HIM THERE IS DISGRACE IN THIS LIFE  AND ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT WE SHALL MAKE HIM TASTE THE PENALTY OF BURNING  FIRE  
    IT WILL BE SAID      THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE DEEDS WHICH THY HANDS SENT FORTH  FOR VERILY GOD IS NOT UNJUST TO HIS SERVANTS  SECTION  
   THERE ARE AMONG MEN SOME WHO SERVE GOD  AS IT WERE  ON THE VERGE   IF GOOD BEFALLS THEM  THEY ARE  THEREWITH  WELL CONTENT   BUT IF A TRIAL COMES TO THEM  THEY TURN ON THEIR FACES   THEY LOSE BOTH THIS WORLD AND THE HEREAFTER   THAT IS LOSS FOR ALL TO SEE  
   THEY CALL ON SUCH DEITIES  BESIDES GOD  AS CAN NEITHER HURT NOR PROFIT THEM   THAT IS STRAYING FAR INDEED  FROM THE WAY   
    PERHAPS  THEY CALL ON ONE WHOSE HURT IS NEARER THAN HIS PROFIT   EVIL  INDEED  IS THE PATRON  AND EVIL THE COMPANION  FOR HELP   
   VERILY GOD WILL ADMIT THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  TO GARDENS  BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW   FOR GOD CARRIES OUT ALL THAT HE PLANS 
   IF ANY THINK THAT GOD WILL NOT HELP HIM  HIS APOSTLE  IN THIS WORLD AND THE HEREAFTER  LET HIM STRETCH OUT A ROPE TO THE CEILING AND CUT  HIMSELF  OFF   THEN LET HIM SEE WHETHER HIS PLAN WILL REMOVE THAT WHICH ENRAGES  HIM   
   THUS HAVE WE SENT DOWN CLEAR SIGNS   AND VERILY GOD DOTH GUIDE WHOM HE WILL  
   THOSE WHO BELIEVE  IN THE QUR ĀN   THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE JEWISH  SCRIPTURES   AND THE SABIANS  CHRISTIANS  MAGIANS  AND POLYTHEISTS   GOD WILL JUDGE BETWEEN THEM ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT   FOR GOD IS WITNESS OF ALL THINGS 
   SEEST THOU NOT THAT TO GOD BOW DOWN IN WORSHIP ALL THINGS THAT ARE IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   THE SUN  THE MOON  THE STARS   THE HILLS  THE TREES  THE ANIMALS   AND A GREAT NUMBER AMONG MANKIND   BUT A GREAT NUMBER ARE  ALSO  SUCH AS ARE FIT FOR PUNISHMENT   AND SUCH AS GOD SHALL DISGRACE   NONE CAN RAISE TO HONOUR   FOR GOD CARRIES OUT ALL THAT HE WILLS 
   THESE TWO ANTAGONISTS DISPUTE WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT THEIR LORD   BUT THOSE WHO DENY  THEIR LORD    FOR THEM WILL BE CUT OUT A GARMENT OF FIRE   OVER THEIR HEADS WILL BE POURED OUT BOILING WATER 
   WITH IT WILL BE SCALDED WHAT IS WITHIN THEIR BODIES  AS WELL AS  THEIR  SKINS 
   IN ADDITION THERE WILL BE MACES OF IRON  TO PUNISH  THEM 
   EVERY TIME THEY WISH TO GET AWAY THEREFROM  FROM ANGUISH  THEY WILL BE FORCED BACK THEREIN  AND  IT WILL BE SAID     TASTE YE THE PENALTY OF BURNING    SECTION  
   GOD WILL ADMIT THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  TO GARDENS BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW   THEY SHALL BE ADORNED THEREIN WITH BRACELETS OF GOLD AND PEARLS   AND THEIR GARMENTS THERE WILL BE OF SILK 
   FOR THEY HAVE BEEN GUIDED  IN THIS LIFE  TO THE PUREST OF SPEECHES   THEY HAVE BEEN GUIDED TO THE PATH OF HIM WHO IS WORTHY OF  ALL  PRAISE 
   AS TO THOSE WHO HAVE REJECTED  GOD   AND WOULD KEEP BACK  MEN  FROM THE WAY OF GOD  AND FROM THE SACRED MOSQUE  WHICH WE HAVE MADE  OPEN  TO  ALL  MEN  EQUAL IS THE DWELLER THERE AND THE VISITOR FROM THE COUNTRY  AND ANY WHOSE PURPOSE THEREIN IS PROFANITY OR WRONG DOING  THEM WILL WE CAUSE TO TASTE OF A MOST GRIEVOUS PENALTY SECTION  
   BEHOLD   WE GAVE THE SITE  TO ABRAHAM  OF THE  SACRED  HOUSE   SAYING      ASSOCIATE NOT ANYTHING  IN WORSHIP  WITH ME   AND SANCTIFY MY HOUSE FOR THOSE WHO COMPASS IT ROUND  OR STAND UP  OR BOW  OR PROSTRATE THEMSELVES  THEREIN IN PRAYER  
     AND PROCLAIM THE PILGRIMAGE AMONG MEN   THEY WILL COME TO THEE ON FOOT AND  MOUNTED  ON EVERY KIND OF CAMEL  LEAN ON ACCOUNT OF JOURNEYS THROUGH DEEP AND DISTANT MOUNTAIN HIGHWAYS  
     THAT THEY MAY WITNESS THE BENEFITS  PROVIDED  FOR THEM  AND CELEBRATE THE NAME OF GOD  THROUGH THE DAYS APPOINTED  OVER THE CATTLE WHICH HE HAS PROVIDED FOR THEM  FOR SACRIFICE    THEN EAT YE THEREOF AND FEED THE DISTRESSED ONES IN WANT 
     THEN LET THEM COMPLETE THE RITES PRESCRIBED FOR THEM  PERFORM THEIR VOWS  AND  AGAIN  CIRCUMAMBULATE THE ANCIENT HOUSE  
   SUCH  IS THE PILGRIMAGE    WHOEVER HONOURS THE SACRED RITES OF GOD  FOR HIM IT IS GOOD IN THE SIGHT OF HIS LORD  LAWFUL TO YOU  FOR FOOD IN PILGRIMAGE  ARE CATTLE  EXCEPT THOSE MENTIONED TO YOU  AS EXCEPTIONS    BUT SHUN THE ABOMINATION OF IDOLS  AND SHUN THE WORD THAT IS FALSE  
   BEING TRUE IN FAITH TO GOD  AND NEVER ASSIGNING PARTNERS TO HIM   IF ANYONE ASSIGNS PARTNERS TO GOD  HE IS AS IF HE HAD FALLEN FROM HEAVEN AND BEEN SNATCHED UP BY BIRDS  OR THE WIND HAD SWOOPED  LIKE A BIRD ON ITS PREY  AND THROWN HIM INTO A FAR DISTANT PLACE 
   SUCH  IS HIS STATE    AND WHOEVER HOLDS IN HONOUR THE SYMBOLS OF GOD   IN THE SACRIFICE OF ANIMALS   SUCH  HONOUR  SHOULD COME TRULY FROM PIETY OF HEART 
   IN THEM YE HAVE BENEFITS FOR A TERM APPOINTED   IN THE END THEIR PLACE OF SACRIFICE IS NEAR THE ANCIENT HOUSE SECTION  
   TO EVERY PEOPLE DID WE APPOINT RITES  OF SACRIFICE   THAT THEY MIGHT CELEBRATE THE NAME OF GOD OVER THE SUSTENANCE HE GAVE THEM FROM ANIMALS  FIT FOR FOOD   BUT YOUR GOD IS ONE GOD   SUBMIT THEN YOUR WILLS TO HIM  IN ISLAM    AND GIVE THOU THE GOOD NEWS TO THOSE WHO HUMBLE THEMSELVES  
   TO THOSE WHOSE HEARTS  WHEN GOD IS MENTIONED  ARE FILLED WITH FEAR  WHO SHOW PATIENT PERSEVERANCE OVER THEIR AFFLICTIONS  KEEP UP REGULAR PRAYER  AND SPEND  IN CHARITY  OUT OF WHAT WE HAVE BESTOWED UPON THEM 
   THE SACRIFICIAL CAMELS WE HAVE MADE FOR YOU AS AMONG THE SYMBOLS FROM GOD   IN THEM IS  MUCH  GOOD FOR YOU   THEN PRONOUNCE THE NAME OF GOD OVER THEM AS THEY LINE UP  FOR SACRIFICE    WHEN THEY ARE DOWN ON THEIR SIDES  AFTER SLAUGHTER   EAT YE THEREOF  AND FEED SUCH AS  BEG NOT BUT  LIVE IN CONTENTMENT  AND SUCH AS BEG WITH DUE HUMILITY   THUS HAVE WE MADE ANIMALS SUBJECT TO YOU  THAT YE MAY BE GRATEFUL 
   IT IS NOT THEIR MEAT NOR THEIR BLOOD  THAT REACHES GOD   IT IS YOUR PIETY THAT REACHES HIM   HE HAS THUS MADE THEM SUBJECT TO YOU  THAT YE MAY GLORIFY GOD FOR HIS GUIDANCE TO YOU   AND PROCLAIM THE GOOD NEWS TO ALL WHO DO RIGHT 
   VERILY GOD WILL DEFEND  FROM ILL  THOSE WHO BELIEVE   VERILY  GOD LOVETH NOT ANY THAT IS A TRAITOR TO FAITH  OR SHOWS INGRATITUDE SECTION  
   TO THOSE AGAINST WHOM WAR IS MADE  PERMISSION IS GIVEN  TO FIGHT   BECAUSE THEY ARE WRONGED   AND VERILY  GOD IS MOST POWERFUL FOR THEIR AID   
    THEY ARE  THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN EXPELLED FROM THEIR HOMES IN DEFIANCE OF RIGHT    FOR NO CAUSE  EXCEPT THAT THEY SAY    OUR LORD IS GOD    DID NOT GOD CHECK ONE SET OF PEOPLE BY MEANS OF ANOTHER  THERE WOULD SURELY HAVE BEEN PULLED DOWN MONASTERIES  CHURCHES  SYNAGOGUES  AND MOSQUES  IN WHICH THE NAME OF GOD IS COMMEMORATED IN ABUNDANT MEASURE  GOD WILL CERTAINLY AID THOSE WHO AID HIS  CAUSE    FOR VERILY GOD IS FULL OF STRENGTH  EXALTED IN MIGHT   ABLE TO ENFORCE HIS WILL  
    THEY ARE  THOSE WHO  IF WE ESTABLISH THEM IN THE LAND  ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER AND GIVE REGULAR CHARITY  ENJOIN THE RIGHT AND FORBID WRONG   WITH GOD RESTS THE END  AND DECISION  OF  ALL  AFFAIRS 
   IF THEY TREAT THY  MISSION  AS FALSE  SO DID THE PEOPLES BEFORE THEM  WITH THEIR PROPHETS    THE PEOPLE OF NOAH  AND  ĀD AND THAMŪD  
   THOSE OF ABRAHAM AND LŪṬ  
   AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE MADYAN PEOPLE   AND MOSES WAS REJECTED  IN THE SAME WAY   BUT I GRANTED RESPITE TO THE UNBELIEVERS  AND  ONLY  AFTER THAT DID I PUNISH THEM   BUT HOW  TERRIBLE  WAS MY REJECTION  OF THEM   
   HOW MANY POPULATIONS HAVE WE DESTROYED  WHICH WERE GIVEN TO WRONG DOING   THEY TUMBLED DOWN ON THEIR ROOFS  AND HOW MANY WELLS ARE LYING IDLE AND NEGLECTED  AND CASTLES LOFTY AND WELL BUILT  
   DO THEY NOT TRAVEL THROUGH THE LAND  SO THAT THEIR HEARTS  AND MIND  MAY THUS LEARN WISDOM AND THEIR EARS MAY THUS LEARN TO HEAR   TRULY IT IS NOT THEIR EYES THAT ARE BLIND  BUT THEIR HEARTS WHICH ARE IN THEIR BREASTS 
   YET THEY ASK THEE TO HASTEN ON THE PUNISHMENT   BUT GOD WILL NOT FAIL IN HIS PROMISE  VERILY A DAY IN THE SIGHT OF THY LORD IS LIKE A THOUSAND YEARS OF YOUR RECKONING 
   AND TO HOW MANY POPULATIONS DID I GIVE RESPITE  WHICH WERE GIVEN TO WRONG DOING   IN THE END I PUNISHED THEM  TO ME IS THE DESTINATION  OF ALL  SECTION  
   SAY     O MEN   I AM  SENT  TO YOU ONLY TO GIVE A CLEAR WARNING  
     THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS  FOR THEM IS FORGIVENESS AND A SUSTENANCE MOST GENEROUS 
     BUT THOSE WHO STRIVE AGAINST OUR SIGNS  TO FRUSTRATE THEM  THEY WILL BE COMPANIONS OF THE FIRE  
   NEVER DID WE SEND AN APOSTLE OR A PROPHET BEFORE THEE  BUT  WHEN HE FRAMED A DESIRE  SATAN THREW SOME  VANITY  INTO HIS DESIRE   BUT GOD WILL CANCEL ANYTHING  VAIN  THAT SATAN THROWS IN  AND GOD WILL CONFIRM  AND ESTABLISH  HIS SIGNS   FOR GOD IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM  
   THAT HE MAY MAKE THE SUGGESTIONS THROWN IN BY SATAN  BUT A TRIAL FOR THOSE IN WHOSE HEARTS IS A DISEASE AND WHO ARE HARDENED OF HEART   VERILY THE WRONG DOERS ARE IN A SCHISM FAR  FROM THE TRUTH   
   AND THAT THOSE ON WHOM KNOWLEDGE HAS BEEN BESTOWED MAY LEARN THAT THE  QUR ĀN  IS THE TRUTH FROM THY LORD  AND THAT THEY MAY BELIEVE THEREIN  AND THEIR HEARTS MAY BE MADE HUMBLY  OPEN  TO IT   FOR VERILY GOD IS THE GUIDE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE  TO THE STRAIGHT WAY 
   THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH WILL NOT CEASE TO BE IN DOUBT CONCERNING  REVELATION  UNTIL THE HOUR  OF JUDGMENT  COMES SUDDENLY UPON THEM  OR THERE COMES TO THEM THE PENALTY OF A DAY OF DISASTER 
   ON THAT DAY THE DOMINION WILL BE THAT OF GOD   HE WILL JUDGE BETWEEN THEM   SO THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUS DEEDS WILL BE IN GARDENS OF DELIGHT 
   AND FOR THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH AND DENY OUR SIGNS  THERE WILL BE A HUMILIATING PUNISHMENT SECTION  
   THOSE WHO LEAVE THEIR HOMES IN THE CAUSE OF GOD  AND ARE THEN SLAIN OR DIE   ON THEM WILL GOD BESTOW VERILY A GOODLY PROVISION     GOD IS HE WHO BESTOWS THE BEST PROVISION 
   VERILY HE WILL ADMIT THEM TO A PLACE WITH WHICH THEY SHALL BE WELL PLEASED   FOR GOD IS ALL KNOWING  MOST FORBEARING 
   THAT  IS SO   AND IF ONE HAS RETALIATED TO NO GREATER EXTENT THAN THE INJURY HE RECEIVED  AND IS AGAIN SET UPON INORDINATELY  GOD WILL HELP HIM   FOR GOD IS ONE THAT BLOTS OUT  SINS  AND FORGIVES  AGAIN AND AGAIN  
   THAT IS BECAUSE GOD MERGES NIGHT INTO DAY  AND HE MERGES DAY INTO NIGHT  AND VERILY IT IS GOD WHO HEARS AND SEES  ALL THINGS  
   THAT IS BECAUSE GOD HE IS THE REALITY   AND THOSE BESIDES HIM WHOM THEY INVOKE   THEY ARE BUT VAIN FALSEHOOD   VERILY GOD IS HE  MOST HIGH  MOST GREAT 
   SEEST THOU NOT THAT GOD SENDS DOWN RAIN FROM THE SKY  AND FORTHWITH THE EARTH BECOMES CLOTHED WITH GREEN   FOR GOD IS HE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE FINEST MYSTERIES  AND IS WELL ACQUAINTED  WITH THEM  
   TO HIM BELONGS ALL THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   FOR VERILY GOD  HE IS FREE OF ALL WANTS  WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE SECTION  
   SEEST THOU NOT THAT GOD HAS MADE SUBJECT TO YOU  MEN  ALL THAT IS ON THE EARTH  AND THE SHIPS THAT SAIL THROUGH THE SEA BY HIS COMMAND   HE WITHHOLDS THE SKY  RAIN  FROM FALLING ON THE EARTH EXCEPT BY HIS LEAVE   FOR GOD IS MOST KIND AND MOST MERCIFUL TO MAN 
   IT IS HE WHO GAVE YOU LIFE  WILL CAUSE YOU TO DIE  AND WILL AGAIN GIVE YOU LIFE   TRULY MAN IS A MOST UNGRATEFUL CREATURE  
   TO EVERY PEOPLE HAVE WE APPOINTED RITES AND CEREMONIES WHICH THEY MUST FOLLOW   LET THEM NOT THEN DISPUTE WITH THEE ON THE MATTER  BUT DO THOU INVITE  THEM  TO THY LORD   FOR THOU ART ASSUREDLY ON THE RIGHT WAY 
   IF THEY DO WRANGLE WITH THEE  SAY    GOD KNOWS BEST WHAT IT IS YE ARE DOING  
     GOD WILL JUDGE BETWEEN YOU ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT CONCERNING THE MATTERS IN WHICH YE DIFFER  
   KNOWEST THOU NOT THAT GOD KNOWS ALL THAT IS IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH   INDEED IT IS ALL IN A RECORD  AND THAT IS EASY FOR GOD 
   YET THEY WORSHIP  BESIDES GOD  THINGS FOR WHICH NO AUTHORITY HAS BEEN SENT DOWN TO THEM  AND OF WHICH THEY HAVE  REALLY  NO KNOWLEDGE   FOR THOSE THAT DO WRONG THERE IS NO HELPER 
   WHEN OUR CLEAR SIGNS ARE REHEARSED TO THEM  THOU WILT NOTICE A DENIAL ON THE FACES OF THE UNBELIEVERS   THEY NEARLY ATTACK WITH VIOLENCE THOSE WHO REHEARSE OUR SIGNS TO THEM  SAY    SHALL I TELL YOU OF SOMETHING  FAR  WORSE THAN THESE SIGNS   IT IS THE FIRE  OF HELL    GOD HAS PROMISED IT TO THE UNBELIEVERS   AND EVIL IS THAT DESTINATION    SECTION  
   O MEN   HERE IS A PARABLE SET FORTH   LISTEN TO IT   THOSE ON WHOM  BESIDES GOD  YE CALL  CANNOT CREATE  EVEN  A FLY  IF THEY ALL MET TOGETHER FOR THE PURPOSE   AND IF THE FLY SHOULD SNATCH AWAY ANYTHING FROM THEM  THEY WOULD HAVE NO POWER TO RELEASE IT FROM THE FLY  FEEBLE ARE THOSE WHO PETITION AND THOSE WHOM THEY PETITION  
   NO JUST ESTIMATE HAVE THEY MADE OF GOD   FOR GOD IS HE WHO IS STRONG AND ABLE TO CARRY OUT HIS WILL 
   GOD CHOOSES MESSENGERS FROM ANGELS AND FROM MEN FOR GOD IS HE WHO HEARS AND SEES  ALL THINGS  
   HE KNOWS WHAT IS BEFORE THEM AND WHAT IS BEHIND THEM   AND TO GOD GO BACK ALL QUESTIONS  FOR DECISION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   BOW DOWN  PROSTRATE YOURSELVES  AND ADORE YOUR LORD   AND DO GOOD   THAT YE MAY PROSPER 
   AND STRIVE IN HIS CAUSE AS YE OUGHT TO STRIVE   WITH SINCERITY AND UNDER DISCIPLINE   HE HAS CHOSEN YOU  AND HAS IMPOSED NO DIFFICULTIES ON YOU IN RELIGION   IT IS THE CULT OF YOUR FATHER ABRAHAM  IT IS HE WHO HAS NAMED YOU MUSLIMS  BOTH BEFORE AND IN THIS  REVELATION    THAT THE APOSTLE MAY BE A WITNESS FOR YOU  AND YE BE WITNESSES FOR MANKIND   SO ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER  GIVE REGULAR CHARITY  AND HOLD FAST TO GOD   HE IS YOUR PROTECTOR  THE BEST TO PROTECT AND THE BEST TO HELP  
   THE BELIEVERS MUST  EVENTUALLY  WIN THROUGH  
   THOSE WHO HUMBLE THEMSELVES IN THEIR PRAYERS  
   WHO AVOID VAIN TALK  
   WHO ARE ACTIVE IN DEEDS OF CHARITY  
   WHO ABSTAIN FROM SEX 
   EXCEPT WITH THOSE JOINED TO THEM IN THE MARRIAGE BOND  OR  THE CAPTIVES  WHOM THEIR RIGHT HANDS POSSESS   FOR  IN THEIR CASE  THEY ARE FREE FROM BLAME 
   BUT THOSE WHOSE DESIRES EXCEED THOSE LIMITS ARE TRANSGRESSORS   
   THOSE WHO FAITHFULLY OBSERVE THEIR TRUSTS AND THEIR COVENANTS  
   AND WHO  STRICTLY  GUARD THEIR PRAYERS   
   THOSE WILL BE THE HEIRS 
   WHO WILL INHERIT PARADISE   THEY WILL DWELL THEREIN  FOR EVER  
   MAN WE DID CREATE FROM A QUINTESSENCE  OF CLAY   
   THEN WE PLACED HIM AS  A DROP OF  SPERM IN A PLACE OF REST  FIRMLY FIXED  
   THEN WE MADE THE SPERM INTO A CLOT OF CONGEALED BLOOD   THEN OF THAT CLOT WE MADE A  FŒTUS  LUMP   THEN WE MADE OUT OF THAT LUMP BONES AND CLOTHED THE BONES WITH FLESH   THEN WE DEVELOPED OUT OF IT ANOTHER CREATURE  SO BLESSED BE GOD  THE BEST TO CREATE  
   AFTER THAT  AT LENGTH YE WILL DIE 
   AGAIN  ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  WILL YE BE RAISED UP 
   AND WE HAVE MADE  ABOVE YOU  SEVEN TRACTS   AND WE ARE NEVER UNMINDFUL OF  OUR  CREATION 
   AND WE SEND DOWN WATER FROM THE SKY ACCORDING TO  DUE  MEASURE  AND WE CAUSE IT TO SOAK IN THE SOIL   AND WE CERTAINLY ARE ABLE TO DRAIN IT OFF  WITH EASE  
   WITH IT WE GROW FOR YOU GARDENS OF DATE PALMS AND VINES   IN THEM HAVE YE ABUNDANT FRUITS   AND OF THEM YE EAT  AND HAVE ENJOYMENT   
   ALSO A TREE SPRINGING OUT OF MOUNT SINAI  WHICH PRODUCES OIL  AND RELISH FOR THOSE WHO USE IT FOR FOOD 
   AND IN CATTLE  TOO  YE HAVE AN INSTRUCTIVE EXAMPLE   FROM WITHIN THEIR BODIES WE PRODUCE  MILK  FOR YOU TO DRINK   THERE ARE  IN THEM   BESIDES   NUMEROUS  OTHER  BENEFITS FOR YOU   AND OF THEIR  MEAT  YE EAT  
   AND ON THEM  AS WELL AS IN SHIPS  YE RIDE SECTION  
    FURTHER  WE SENT A LONG LINE OF PROPHETS FOR YOUR INSTRUCTION   WE SENT NOAH TO HIS PEOPLE   HE SAID    O MY PEOPLE   WORSHIP GOD   YE HAVE NO OTHER GOD BUT HIM  WILL YE NOT FEAR  HIM     
   THE CHIEFS OF THE UNBELIEVERS AMONG HIS PEOPLE SAID     HE IS NO MORE THAN A MAN LIKE YOURSELVES   HIS WISH IS TO ASSERT HIS SUPERIORITY OVER YOU   IF GOD HAD WISHED  TO SEND MESSENGERS   HE COULD HAVE SENT DOWN ANGELS   NEVER DID WE HEAR SUCH A THING  AS HE SAYS   AMONG OUR ANCESTORS OF OLD  
    AND SOME SAID      HE IS ONLY A MAN POSSESSED   WAIT  AND HAVE PATIENCE  WITH HIM FOR A TIME  
    NOAH  SAID     O MY LORD   HELP ME   FOR THAT THEY ACCUSE ME OF FALSEHOOD    
   SO WE INSPIRED HIM  WITH THIS MESSAGE      CONSTRUCT THE ARK WITHIN OUR SIGHT AND UNDER OUR GUIDANCE   THEN WHEN COMES OUR COMMAND  AND THE FOUNTAINS OF THE EARTH GUSH FORTH  TAKE THOU ON BOARD PAIRS OF EVERY SPECIES  MALE AND FEMALE  AND THY FAMILY  EXCEPT THOSE OF THEM AGAINST WHOM THE WORD HAS ALREADY GONE FORTH   AND ADDRESS ME NOT IN FAVOUR OF THE WRONG DOERS   FOR THEY SHALL BE DROWNED  IN THE FLOOD  
   AND WHEN THOU HAST EMBARKED ON THE ARK THOU AND THOSE WITH THEE  SAY     PRAISE BE TO GOD  WHO HAS SAVED US FROM THE PEOPLE WHO DO WRONG  
   AND SAY     O MY LORD   ENABLE ME TO DISEMBARK WITH THY BLESSING   FOR THOU ART THE BEST TO ENABLE  US  TO DISEMBARK  
   VERILY IN THIS THERE ARE SIGNS  FOR MEN TO UNDERSTAND     THUS  DO WE TRY  MEN  
   THEN WE RAISED AFTER THEM ANOTHER GENERATION 
   AND WE SENT TO THEM AN APOSTLE FROM AMONG THEMSELVES   SAYING     WORSHIP GOD   YE HAVE NO OTHER GOD BUT HIM  WILL YE NOT FEAR  HIM     SECTION  
   AND THE CHIEFS OF HIS PEOPLE  WHO DISBELIEVED AND DENIED THE MEETING IN THE HEREAFTER  AND ON WHOM WE HAD BESTOWED THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS LIFE  SAID     HE IS NO MORE THAN A MAN LIKE YOURSELVES   HE EATS OF THAT OF WHICH YE EAT  AND DRINKS OF WHAT YE DRINK 
     IF YE OBEY A MAN LIKE YOURSELVES  BEHOLD  IT IS CERTAIN YE WILL BE LOST 
     DOES HE PROMISE THAT WHEN YE DIE AND BECOME DUST AND BONES  YE SHALL BE BROUGHT FORTH  AGAIN   
     FAR  VERY FAR IS THAT WHICH YE ARE PROMISED  
     THERE IS NOTHING BUT OUR LIFE IN THIS WORLD   WE SHALL DIE AND WE LIVE   BUT WE SHALL NEVER BE RAISED UP AGAIN  
     HE IS ONLY A MAN WHO INVENTS A LIE AGAINST GOD  BUT WE ARE NOT THE ONES TO BELIEVE IN HIM    
    THE PROPHET  SAID     O MY LORD   HELP ME   FOR THAT THEY ACCUSE ME OF FALSEHOOD  
    GOD  SAID     IN BUT A LITTLE WHILE  THEY ARE SURE TO BE SORRY    
   THEN THE BLAST OVERTOOK THEM WITH JUSTICE  AND WE MADE THEM AS RUBBISH OF DEAD LEAVES  FLOATING ON THE STREAM OF TIME    SO AWAY WITH THE PEOPLE WHO DO WRONG  
   THEN WE RAISED AFTER THEM OTHER GENERATIONS 
   NO PEOPLE CAN HASTEN THEIR TERM  NOR CAN THEY DELAY  IT  
   THEN SENT WE OUR APOSTLES IN SUCCESSION   EVERY TIME THERE CAME TO A PEOPLE THEIR APOSTLE  THEY ACCUSED HIM OF FALSEHOOD   SO WE MADE THEM FOLLOW EACH OTHER  IN PUNISHMENT    WE MADE THEM AS A TALE  THAT IS TOLD    SO AWAY WITH A PEOPLE THAT WILL NOT BELIEVE  
   THEN WE SENT MOSES AND HIS BROTHER AARON  WITH OUR SIGNS AND AUTHORITY MANIFEST 
   TO PHARAOH AND HIS CHIEFS   BUT THESE BEHAVED INSOLENTLY   THEY WERE AN ARROGANT PEOPLE 
   THEY SAID     SHALL WE BELIEVE IN TWO MEN LIKE OURSELVES   AND THEIR PEOPLE ARE SUBJECT TO US    
   SO THEY ACCUSED THEM OF FALSEHOOD  AND THEY BECAME OF THOSE WHO WERE DESTROYED 
   AND WE GAVE MOSES THE BOOK  IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT RECEIVE GUIDANCE 
   AND WE MADE THE SON OF MARY AND HIS MOTHER AS A SIGN   WE GAVE THEM BOTH SHELTER ON HIGH GROUND  AFFORDING REST AND SECURITY AND FURNISHED WITH SPRINGS SECTION  
   O YE APOSTLES   ENJOY  ALL  THINGS GOOD AND PURE  AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS   FOR I AM WELL ACQUAINTED WITH  ALL  THAT YE DO 
   AND VERILY THIS BROTHERHOOD OF YOURS IS A SINGLE BROTHERHOOD  AND I AM YOUR LORD AND CHERISHER   THEREFORE FEAR ME  AND NO OTHER  
   BUT PEOPLE HAVE CUT OFF THEIR AFFAIR  OF UNITY   BETWEEN THEM  INTO SECTS   EACH PARTY REJOICES IN THAT WHICH IS WITH ITSELF 
   BUT LEAVE THEM IN THEIR CONFUSED IGNORANCE FOR A TIME 
   DO THEY THINK THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE GRANTED THEM ABUNDANCE OF WEALTH AND SONS 
   WE WOULD HASTEN THEM ON IN EVERY GOOD   NAY  THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND 
   VERILY THOSE WHO LIVE IN AWE FOR FEAR OF THEIR LORD  
   THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THE SIGNS OF THEIR LORD  
   THOSE WHO JOIN NOT  IN WORSHIP  PARTNERS WITH THEIR LORD  
   AND THOSE WHO DISPENSE THEIR CHARITY WITH THEIR HEARTS FULL OF FEAR  BECAUSE THEY WILL RETURN TO THEIR LORD   
   IT IS THESE WHO HASTEN IN EVERY GOOD WORK  AND THESE WHO ARE FOREMOST IN THEM 
   ON NO SOUL DO WE PLACE A BURDEN GREATER THAN IT CAN BEAR   BEFORE US IS A RECORD WHICH CLEARLY SHOWS THE TRUTH   THEY WILL NEVER BE WRONGED 
   BUT THEIR HEARTS ARE IN CONFUSED IGNORANCE OF THIS   AND THERE ARE  BESIDES THAT  DEEDS OF THEIRS  WHICH THEY WILL  CONTINUE  TO DO  
   UNTIL  WHEN WE SEIZE IN PUNISHMENT THOSE OF THEM WHO RECEIVED THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS WORLD  BEHOLD  THEY WILL GROAN IN SUPPLICATION  
    IT WILL BE SAID      GROAN NOT IN SUPPLICATION THIS DAY   FOR YE SHALL CERTAINLY NOT BE HELPED BY US 
     MY SIGNS USED TO BE REHEARSED TO YOU  BUT YE USED TO TURN BACK ON YOUR HEELS 
     IN ARROGANCE   TALKING NONSENSE ABOUT THE  QUR ĀN   LIKE ONE TELLING FABLES BY NIGHT  
   DO THEY NOT PONDER OVER THE WORD  OF GOD   OR HAS ANYTHING  NEW  COME TO THEM THAT DID NOT COME TO THEIR FATHERS OF OLD  
   OR DO THEY NOT RECOGNISE THEIR APOSTLE  THAT THEY DENY HIM  
   OR DO THEY SAY    HE IS POSSESSED     NAY  HE HAS BROUGHT THEM THE TRUTH  BUT MOST OF THEM HATE THE TRUTH 
   IF THE TRUTH HAD BEEN IN ACCORD WITH THEIR DESIRES  TRULY THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND ALL BEINGS THEREIN WOULD HAVE BEEN IN CONFUSION AND CORRUPTION   NAY  WE HAVE SENT THEM THEIR ADMONITION  BUT THEY TURN AWAY FROM THEIR ADMONITION 
   OR IS IT THAT THOU ASKEST THEM FOR SOME RECOMPENSE   BUT THE RECOMPENSE OF THY LORD IS BEST   HE IS THE BEST OF THOSE WHO GIVE SUSTENANCE 
   BUT VERILY THOU CALLEST THEM TO THE STRAIGHT WAY  
   AND VERILY THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT IN THE HEREAFTER ARE DEVIATING FROM THAT WAY 
   IF WE HAD MERCY ON THEM AND REMOVED THE DISTRESS WHICH IS ON THEM  THEY WOULD OBSTINATELY PERSIST IN THEIR TRANSGRESSION  WANDERING IN DISTRACTION TO AND FRO 
   WE INFLICTED PUNISHMENT ON THEM  BUT THEY HUMBLED NOT THEMSELVES TO THEIR LORD  NOR DO THEY SUBMISSIVELY ENTREAT  HIM    
   UNTIL WE OPEN ON THEM A GATE LEADING TO A SEVERE PUNISHMENT   THEN LO   THEY WILL BE PLUNGED IN DESPAIR THEREIN  SECTION  
   IT IS HE WHO HAS CREATED FOR YOU  THE FACULTIES OF  HEARING  SIGHT  FEELING AND UNDERSTANDING   LITTLE THANKS IT IS YE GIVE  
   AND HE HAS MULTIPLIED YOU THROUGH THE EARTH  AND TO HIM SHALL YE BE GATHERED BACK 
   IT IS HE WHO GIVES LIFE AND DEATH  AND TO HIM  IS DUE  THE ALTERNATION OF NIGHT AND DAY   WILL YE NOT THEN UNDERSTAND  
   ON THE CONTRARY THEY SAY THINGS SIMILAR TO WHAT THE ANCIENTS SAID 
   THEY SAY     WHAT   WHEN WE DIE AND BECOME DUST AND BONES  COULD WE REALLY BE RAISED UP AGAIN  
     SUCH THINGS HAVE BEEN PROMISED TO US AND TO OUR FATHERS BEFORE   THEY ARE NOTHING BUT TALES OF THE ANCIENTS    
   SAY     TO WHOM BELONG THE EARTH AND ALL BEINGS THEREIN    SAY  IF YE KNOW    
   THEY WILL SAY    TO GOD     SAY     YET WILL YE NOT RECEIVE ADMONITION    
   SAY     WHO IS THE LORD OF THE SEVEN HEAVENS  AND THE LORD OF THE THRONE  OF GLORY  SUPREME    
   THEY WILL SAY     THEY BELONG  TO GOD   SAY     WILL YE NOT THEN BE FILLED WITH AWE    
   SAY     WHO IS IT IN WHOSE HANDS IS THE GOVERNANCE OF ALL THINGS  WHO PROTECTS  ALL   BUT IS NOT PROTECTED  OF ANY     SAY  IF YE KNOW  
   THEY WILL SAY     IT BELONGS  TO GOD   SAY     THEN HOW ARE YE DELUDED    
   WE HAVE SENT THEM THE TRUTH   BUT THEY INDEED PRACTICE FALSEHOOD  
   NO SON DID GOD BEGET  NOR IS THERE ANY GOD ALONG WITH HIM    IF THERE WERE MANY GODS   BEHOLD  EACH GOD WOULD HAVE TAKEN AWAY WHAT HE HAD CREATED  AND SOME WOULD HAVE LORDED IT OVER OTHERS   GLORY TO GOD    HE IS FREE  FROM THE  SORT OF  THINGS THEY ATTRIBUTE TO HIM  
   HE KNOWS WHAT IS HIDDEN AND WHAT IS OPEN   TOO HIGH IS HE FOR THE PARTNERS THEY ATTRIBUTE TO HIM  SECTION  
   SAY     O MY LORD   IF THOU WILT SHOW ME  IN MY LIFETIME  THAT WHICH THEY ARE WARNED AGAINST  
     THEN  O MY LORD   PUT ME NOT AMONGST THE PEOPLE WHO DO WRONG    
   AND WE ARE CERTAINLY ABLE TO SHOW THEE  IN FULFILMENT  THAT AGAINST WHICH THEY ARE WARNED 
   REPEL EVIL WITH THAT WHICH IS BEST   WE ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE THINGS THEY SAY 
   AND SAY   O MY LORD   I SEEK REFUGE WITH THEE FROM THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE EVIL ONES 
     AND I SEEK REFUGE WITH THEE O MY LORD   LEST THEY SHOULD COME NEAR ME  
    IN FALSEHOOD WILL THEY BE  UNTIL  WHEN DEATH COMES TO ONE OF THEM  HE SAYS     O MY LORD   SEND ME BACK  TO LIFE   
     IN ORDER THAT I MAY WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE THINGS I NEGLECTED     BY NO MEANS   IT IS BUT A WORD HE SAYS    BEFORE THEM IS A PARTITION TILL THE DAY THEY ARE RAISED UP 
   THEN WHEN THE TRUMPET IS BLOWN  THERE WILL BE NO MORE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM THAT DAY  NOR WILL ONE ASK AFTER ANOTHER  
   THEN THOSE WHOSE BALANCE  OF GOOD DEEDS  IS HEAVY   THEY WILL ATTAIN SALVATION  
   BUT THOSE WHOSE BALANCE IS LIGHT  WILL BE THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR SOULS   IN HELL WILL THEY ABIDE 
   THE FIRE WILL BURN THEIR FACES  AND THEY WILL THEREIN GRIN  WITH THEIR LIPS DISPLACED 
     WERE NOT MY SIGNS REHEARSED TO YOU  AND YE DID BUT TREAT THEM AS FALSEHOODS    
   THEY WILL SAY     OUR LORD   OUR MISFORTUNE OVERWHELMED US  AND WE BECAME A PEOPLE ASTRAY  
     OUR LORD   BRING US OUT OF THIS   IF EVER WE RETURN  TO EVIL   THEN SHALL WE BE WRONG DOERS INDEED    
   HE WILL SAY     BE YE DRIVEN INTO IT  WITH IGNOMINY    AND SPEAK YE NOT TO ME  
     A PART OF MY SERVANTS THERE WAS  WHO USED TO PRAY    OUR LORD   WE BELIEVE   THEN DO THOU FORGIVE US  AND HAVE MERCY UPON US   FOR THOU ART THE BEST OF THOSE WHO SHOW MERCY    
     BUT YE TREATED THEM WITH RIDICULE  SO MUCH SO THAT  RIDICULE OF  THEM MADE YOU FORGET MY MESSAGE WHILE YE WERE LAUGHING AT THEM  
     I HAVE REWARDED THEM THIS DAY FOR THEIR PATIENCE AND CONSTANCY   THEY ARE INDEED THE ONES THAT HAVE ACHIEVED BLISS  
   HE WILL SAY     WHAT NUMBER OF YEARS DID YE STAY ON EARTH    
   THEY WILL SAY     WE STAYED A DAY OR PART OF A DAY   BUT ASK THOSE WHO KEEP ACCOUNT  
   HE WILL SAY     YE STAYED NOT BUT A LITTLE   IF YE HAD ONLY KNOWN  
     DID YE THEN THINK THAT WE HAD CREATED YOU IN JEST  AND THAT YE WOULD NOT BE BROUGHT BACK TO US  FOR ACCOUNT     
   THEREFORE EXALTED BE GOD  THE KING  THE REALITY   THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE  THE LORD OF THE THRONE OF HONOUR  
   IF ANYONE INVOKES  BESIDES GOD  ANY OTHER GOD  HE HAS NO AUTHORITY THEREFOR   AND HIS RECKONING WILL BE ONLY WITH HIS LORD   AND VERILY THE UNBELIEVERS WILL FAIL TO WIN THROUGH  
   SO SAY     O MY LORD   GRANT THOU FORGIVENESS AND MERCY   FOR THOU ART THE BEST OF THOSE WHO SHOW MERCY    
   A SŪRA WHICH WE HAVE SENT DOWN AND WHICH WE HAVE ORDAINED   IN IT HAVE WE SENT DOWN CLEAR SIGNS  IN ORDER THAT YE MAY RECEIVE ADMONITION 
   THE WOMAN AND THE MAN GUILTY OF ADULTERY OR FORNICATION   FLOG EACH OF THEM WITH A HUNDRED STRIPES   LET NOT COMPASSION MOVE YOU IN THEIR CASE  IN A MATTER PRESCRIBED BY GOD  IF YE BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY   AND LET A PARTY OF THE BELIEVERS WITNESS THEIR PUNISHMENT 
    LET NO MAN GUILTY OF ADULTERY OR FORNICATION MARRY ANY BUT A WOMAN SIMILARLY GUILTY  OR AN UNBELIEVER   NOR LET ANY BUT SUCH A MAN OR AN UNBELIEVER MARRY SUCH A WOMAN   TO THE BELIEVERS SUCH A THING IS FORBIDDEN 
   AND THOSE WHO LAUNCH A CHARGE AGAINST CHASTE WOMEN  AND PRODUCE NOT FOUR WITNESSES  TO SUPPORT THEIR ALLEGATION    FLOG THEM WITH EIGHTY STRIPES   AND REJECT THEIR EVIDENCE EVER AFTER   FOR SUCH MEN ARE WICKED TRANSGRESSORS   
    UNLESS THEY REPENT THEREAFTER AND MEND  THEIR CONDUCT    FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING MOST MERCIFUL 
   AND FOR THOSE WHO LAUNCH A CHARGE AGAINST THEIR SPOUSES  AND HAVE  IN SUPPORT  NO EVIDENCE BUT THEIR OWN   THEIR SOLITARY EVIDENCE  CAN BE RECEIVED  IF THEY BEAR WITNESS FOUR TIMES  WITH AN OATH  BY GOD THAT THEY ARE SOLEMNLY TELLING THE TRUTH  
    AND THE FIFTH  OATH   SHOULD BE  THAT THEY SOLEMNLY INVOKE THE CURSE OF GOD ON THEMSELVES IF THEY TELL A LIE 
    BUT IT WOULD AVERT THE PUNISHMENT FROM THE WIFE  IF SHE BEARS WITNESS FOUR TIMES  WITH AN OATH  BY GOD  THAT  HER HUSBAND  IS TELLING A LIE  
    AND THE FIFTH  OATH  SHOULD BE THAT SHE SOLEMNLY INVOKES THE WRATH OF GOD ON HERSELF IF  HER ACCUSER  IS TELLING THE TRUTH 
   IF IT WERE NOT FOR GOD S GRACE AND MERCY ON YOU  AND THAT GOD IS OFT RETURNING  FULL OF WISDOM    YE WOULD BE RUINED INDEED  SECTION  
   THOSE WHO BROUGHT FORWARD THE LIE ARE A BODY AMONG YOURSELVES   THINK IT NOT TO BE AN EVIL TO YOU   ON THE CONTRARY IT IS GOOD FOR YOU   TO EVERY MAN AMONG THEM  WILL COME THE PUNISHMENT  OF THE SIN THAT HE EARNED  AND TO HIM WHO TOOK ON HIMSELF THE LEAD AMONG THEM  WILL BE A PENALTY GRIEVOUS 
   WHY DID NOT BELIEVERS  MEN AND WOMEN  WHEN YE HEARD OF THE AFFAIR  PUT THE BEST CONSTRUCTION ON IT IN THEIR OWN MINDS AND SAY    THIS  CHARGE  IS AN OBVIOUS LIE    
   WHY DID THEY NOT BRING FOUR WITNESSES TO PROVE IT   WHEN THEY HAVE NOT BROUGHT THE WITNESSES  SUCH MEN  IN THE SIGHT OF GOD   STAND FORTH  THEMSELVES AS LIARS  
   WERE IT NOT FOR THE GRACE AND MERCY OF GOD ON YOU  IN THIS WORLD AND THE HEREAFTER  A GRIEVOUS PENALTY WOULD HAVE SEIZED YOU IN THAT YE RUSHED GLIBLY INTO THIS AFFAIR 
   BEHOLD  YE RECEIVED IT ON YOUR TONGUES  AND SAID OUT OF YOUR MOUTHS THINGS OF WHICH YE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE   AND YE THOUGHT IT TO BE A LIGHT MATTER  WHILE IT WAS MOST SERIOUS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD 
   AND WHY DID YE NOT  WHEN YE HEARD IT  SAY      IT IS NOT RIGHT OF US TO SPEAK OF THIS   GLORY TO GOD   THIS IS A MOST SERIOUS SLANDER    
   GOD DOTH ADMONISH YOU  THAT YE MAY NEVER REPEAT SUCH  CONDUCT   IF YE ARE  TRUE  BELIEVERS 
   AND GOD MAKES THE SIGNS PLAIN TO YOU   FOR GOD IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM 
   THOSE WHO LOVE  TO SEE  SCANDAL PUBLISHED BROADCAST AMONG THE BELIEVERS  WILL HAVE A GRIEVOUS PENALTY IN THIS LIFE AND IN THE HEREAFTER   GOD KNOWS  AND YE KNOW NOT 
   WERE IT NOT FOR THE GRACE AND MERCY OF GOD ON YOU  AND THAT GOD IS FULL OF KINDNESS AND MERCY   YE WOULD BE RUINED INDEED  SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   FOLLOW NOT SATAN S FOOTSTEPS   IF ANY WILL FOLLOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF SATAN  HE WILL  BUT  COMMAND WHAT IS SHAMEFUL AND WRONG   AND WERE IT NOT FOR THE GRACE AND MERCY OF GOD ON YOU  NOT ONE OF YOU WOULD EVER HAVE BEEN PURE   BUT GOD DOTH PURIFY WHOM HE PLEASES   AND GOD IS ONE WHO HEARS AND KNOWS  ALL THINGS  
   LET NOT THOSE AMONG YOU WHO ARE ENDUED WITH GRACE AND AMPLITUDE OF MEANS RESOLVE BY OATH AGAINST HELPING THEIR KINSMEN  THOSE IN WANT  AND THOSE WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR HOMES IN GOD S CAUSE   LET THEM FORGIVE AND OVERLOOK  DO YOU NOT WISH THAT GOD SHOULD FORGIVE YOU   FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   THOSE WHO SLANDER CHASTE WOMEN  INDISCREET BUT BELIEVING  ARE CURSED IN THIS LIFE AND IN THE HEREAFTER   FOR THEM IS A GRIEVOUS PENALTY  
   ON THE DAY WHEN THEIR TONGUES  THEIR HANDS  AND THEIR FEET WILL BEAR WITNESS AGAINST THEM AS TO THEIR ACTIONS 
   ON THAT DAY GOD WILL PAY THEM BACK  ALL  THEIR JUST DUES  AND THEY WILL REALISE THAT GOD IS THE  VERY  TRUTH  THAT MAKES ALL THINGS MANIFEST 
   WOMEN IMPURE ARE FOR MEN IMPURE  AND MEN IMPURE ARE FOR WOMEN IMPURE AND WOMEN OF PURITY ARE FOR MEN OF PURITY  AND MEN OF PURITY ARE FOR WOMEN OF PURITY   THESE ARE NOT AFFECTED BY WHAT PEOPLE SAY   FOR THEM THERE IS FORGIVENESS  AND A PROVISION HONOURABLE SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   ENTER NOT HOUSES OTHER THAN YOUR OWN  UNTIL YE HAVE ASKED PERMISSION AND SALUTED THOSE IN THEM   THAT IS BEST FOR YOU  IN ORDER THAT YE MAY HEED  WHAT IS SEEMLY  
   IF YE FIND NO ONE IN THE HOUSE  ENTER NOT UNTIL PERMISSION IS GIVEN TO YOU   IF YE ARE ASKED TO GO BACK  GO BACK   THAT MAKES FOR GREATER PURITY FOR YOURSELVES   AND GOD KNOWS WELL ALL THAT YE DO 
   IT IS NO FAULT ON YOUR PART TO ENTER HOUSES NOT USED FOR LIVING IN  WHICH SERVE SOME  OTHER  USE FOR YOU   AND GOD HAS KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT YE REVEAL AND WHAT YE CONCEAL 
   SAY TO THE BELIEVING MEN THAT THEY SHOULD LOWER THEIR GAZE AND GUARD THEIR MODESTY   THAT WILL MAKE FOR GREATER PURITY FOR THEM   AND GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THAT THEY DO 
    AND SAY TO THE BELIEVING WOMEN THAT THEY SHOULD LOWER THEIR GAZE AND GUARD THEIR MODESTY   THAT THEY SHOULD NOT DISPLAY THEIR BEAUTY AND ORNAMENTS EXCEPT WHAT  MUST ORDINARILY  APPEAR THEREOF   THAT THEY SHOULD DRAW THEIR VEILS OVER THEIR BOSOMS AND NOT DISPLAY THEIR BEAUTY EXCEPT TO THEIR HUSBANDS  THEIR FATHERS  THEIR HUSBANDS  FATHERS  THEIR SONS  THEIR HUSBANDS  SONS  THEIR BROTHERS OR THEIR BROTHERS  SONS  OR THEIR SISTERS  SONS  OR THEIR WOMEN  OR THE SLAVES WHOM THEIR RIGHT HANDS POSSESS  OR MALE SERVANTS FREE OF PHYSICAL NEEDS  OR SMALL CHILDREN WHO HAVE NO SENSE OF THE SHAME OF SEX   AND THAT THEY SHOULD NOT STRIKE THEIR FEET IN ORDER TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THEIR HIDDEN ORNAMENTS  AND O YE BELIEVERS   TURN YE ALL TOGETHER TOWARDS GOD  THAT YE MAY ATTAIN BLISS 
   MARRY THOSE AMONG YOU WHO ARE SINGLE  OR THE VIRTUOUS ONES AMONG YOUR SLAVES  MALE OR FEMALE   IF THEY ARE IN POVERTY  GOD WILL GIVE THEM MEANS OUT OF HIS GRACE   FOR GOD ENCOMPASSETH ALL  AND HE KNOWETH ALL THINGS 
   LET THOSE WHO FIND NOT THE WHEREWITHAL FOR MARRIAGE KEEP THEMSELVES CHASTE  UNTIL GOD GIVES THEM MEANS OUT OF HIS GRACE  AND IF ANY OF YOUR SLAVES ASK FOR A DEED IN WRITING  TO ENABLE THEM TO EARN THEIR FREEDOM FOR A CERTAIN SUM   GIVE THEM SUCH A DEED IF YE KNOW ANY GOOD IN THEM   YEA  GIVE THEM SOMETHING YOURSELVES OUT OF THE MEANS WHICH GOD HAS GIVEN TO YOU  BUT FORCE NOT YOUR MAIDS TO PROSTITUTION WHEN THEY DESIRE CHASTITY  IN ORDER THAT YE MAY MAKE A GAIN IN THE GOODS OF THIS LIFE  BUT IF ANYONE COMPELS THEM  YET  AFTER SUCH COMPULSION  IS GOD OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL  TO THEM  
   WE HAVE ALREADY SENT DOWN TO YOU VERSES MAKING THINGS CLEAR  AN ILLUSTRATION FROM  THE STORY OF  PEOPLE WHO PASSED AWAY BEFORE YOU  AND AN ADMONITION FOR THOSE WHO FEAR  GOD  SECTION  
   GOD IS THE LIGHT OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  THE PARABLE OF HIS LIGHT IS AS IF THERE WERE A NICHE AND WITHIN IT A LAMP   THE LAMP ENCLOSED IN GLASS   THE GLASS AS IT WERE A BRILLIANT STAR   LIT FROM A BLESSED TREE  AN OLIVE  NEITHER OF THE EAST NOR OF THE WEST  WHOSE OIL IS WELL NIGH LUMINOUS  THOUGH FIRE SCARCE TOUCHED IT   LIGHT UPON LIGHT   GOD DOTH GUIDE WHOM HE WILL TO HIS LIGHT   GOD DOTH SET FORTH PARABLES FOR MEN   AND GOD DOTH KNOW ALL THINGS 
    LIT IS SUCH A LIGHT  IN HOUSES  WHICH GOD HATH PERMITTED TO BE RAISED TO HONOUR   FOR THE CELEBRATION  IN THEM  OF HIS NAME   IN THEM IS HE GLORIFIED IN THE MORNINGS AND IN THE EVENINGS   AGAIN AND AGAIN   
   BY MEN WHOM NEITHER TRAFFIC NOR MERCHANDISE CAN DIVERT FROM THE REMEMBRANCE OF GOD  NOR FROM REGULAR PRAYER  NOR FROM THE PRACTICE OF REGULAR CHARITY   THEIR  ONLY  FEAR IS FOR THE DAY WHEN HEARTS AND EYES WILL BE TRANSFORMED  IN A WORLD WHOLLY NEW   
   THAT GOD MAY REWARD THEM ACCORDING TO THE BEST OF THEIR DEEDS  AND ADD EVEN MORE FOR THEM OUT OF HIS GRACE   FOR GOD DOTH PROVIDE FOR THOSE WHOM HE WILL  WITHOUT MEASURE 
   BUT THE UNBELIEVERS   THEIR DEEDS ARE LIKE A MIRAGE IN SANDY DESERTS  WHICH THE MAN PARCHED WITH THIRST MISTAKES FOR WATER   UNTIL WHEN HE COMES UP TO IT  HE FINDS IT TO BE NOTHING   BUT HE FINDS GOD  EVER  WITH HIM  AND GOD WILL PAY HIM HIS ACCOUNT   AND GOD IS SWIFT IN TAKING ACCOUNT 
   OR  THE UNBELIEVERS  STATE  IS LIKE THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS IN A VAST DEEP OCEAN  OVERWHELMED WITH BILLOW TOPPED BY BILLOW  TOPPED BY  DARK  CLOUDS   DEPTHS OF DARKNESS  ONE ABOVE ANOTHER   IF A MAN STRETCHES OUT HIS HAND  HE CAN HARDLY SEE IT   FOR ANY TO WHOM GOD GIVETH NOT LIGHT  THERE IS NO LIGHT  SECTION  
   SEEST THOU NOT THAT IT IS GOD WHOSE PRAISES ALL BEINGS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH DO CELEBRATE  AND THE BIRDS  OF THE AIR  WITH WINGS OUTSPREAD   EACH ONE KNOWS ITS OWN  MODE OF  PRAYER AND PRAISE  AND GOD KNOWS WELL ALL THAT THEY DO 
   YEA  TO GOD BELONGS THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   AND TO GOD IS THE FINAL GOAL  OF ALL  
   SEEST THOU NOT THAT GOD MAKES THE CLOUDS MOVE GENTLY  THEN JOINS THEM TOGETHER  THEN MAKES THEM INTO A HEAP   THEN WILT THOU SEE RAIN ISSUE FORTH FROM THEIR MIDST  AND HE SENDS DOWN FROM THE SKY MOUNTAIN MASSES  OF CLOUDS  WHEREIN IS HAIL   HE STRIKES THEREWITH WHOM HE PLEASES AND HE TURNS IT AWAY FROM WHOM HE PLEASES  THE VIVID FLASH OF HIS LIGHTNING WELL NIGH BLINDS THE SIGHT 
   IT IS GOD WHO ALTERNATES THE NIGHT AND THE DAY   VERILY IN THESE THINGS IS AN INSTRUCTIVE EXAMPLE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE VISION  
   AND GOD HAS CREATED EVERY ANIMAL FROM WATER   OF THEM THERE ARE SOME THAT CREEP ON THEIR BELLIES   SOME THAT WALK ON TWO LEGS   AND SOME THAT WALK ON FOUR  GOD CREATES WHAT HE WILLS   FOR VERILY GOD HAS POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   WE HAVE INDEED SENT DOWN SIGNS THAT MAKE THINGS MANIFEST   AND GOD GUIDES WHOM HE WILLS TO A WAY THAT IS STRAIGHT 
   THEY SAY    WE BELIEVE IN GOD AND IN THE APOSTLE  AND WE OBEY     BUT EVEN AFTER THAT  SOME OF THEM TURN AWAY   THEY ARE NOT  REALLY  BELIEVERS 
   WHEN THEY ARE SUMMONED TO GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  IN ORDER THAT HE MAY JUDGE BETWEEN THEM  BEHOLD  SOME OF THEM DECLINE  TO COME  
   BUT IF THE RIGHT IS ON THEIR SIDE  THEY COME TO HIM WITH ALL SUBMISSION 
   IS IT THAT THERE IS A DISEASE IN THEIR HEARTS   OR DO THEY DOUBT  OR ARE THEY IN FEAR  THAT GOD AND HIS APOSTLE WILL DEAL UNJUSTLY WITH THEM   NAY  IT IS THEY THEMSELVES WHO DO WRONG SECTION  
   THE ANSWER OF THE BELIEVERS  WHEN SUMMONED TO GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  IN ORDER THAT HE MAY JUDGE BETWEEN THEM  IS NO OTHER THAN THIS   THEY SAY    WE HEAR AND WE OBEY     IT IS SUCH AS THESE THAT WILL ATTAIN FELICITY 
   IT IS SUCH AS OBEY GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  AND FEAR GOD AND DO RIGHT  THAT WILL WIN  IN THE END  
   THEY SWEAR THEIR STRONGEST OATHS BY GOD THAT  IF ONLY THOU WOULDST COMMAND THEM  THEY WOULD LEAVE  THEIR HOMES   SAY     SWEAR YE NOT   OBEDIENCE IS  MORE  REASONABLE   VERILY  GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THAT YE DO  
   SAY     OBEY GOD  AND OBEY THE APOSTLE     BUT IF YE TURN AWAY  HE IS ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DUTY PLACED ON HIM AND YE FOR THAT PLACED ON YOU  IF YE OBEY HIM  YE SHALL BE ON RIGHT GUIDANCE  THE APOSTLE S DUTY IS ONLY TO PREACH THE CLEAR  MESSAGE  
   GOD HAS PROMISED  TO THOSE AMONG YOU WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  THAT HE WILL  OF A SURETY  GRANT THEM IN THE LAND  INHERITANCE  OF POWER   AS HE GRANTED IT TO THOSE BEFORE THEM   THAT HE WILL ESTABLISH IN AUTHORITY THEIR RELIGION THE ONE WHICH HE HAS CHOSEN FOR THEM   AND THAT HE WILL CHANGE  THEIR STATE   AFTER THE FEAR IN WHICH THEY  LIVED   TO ONE OF SECURITY AND PEACE     THEY WILL WORSHIP ME  ALONE  AND NOT ASSOCIATE AUGHT WITH ME   IF ANY DO REJECT FAITH AFTER THIS  THEY ARE REBELLIOUS AND WICKED 
   SO ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER AND GIVE REGULAR CHARITY   AND OBEY THE APOSTLE   THAT YE MAY RECEIVE MERCY 
   NEVER THINK THOU THAT THE UNBELIEVERS ARE GOING TO FRUSTRATE  GOD S PLAN  ON EARTH   THEIR ABODE IS THE FIRE   AND IT IS INDEED AN EVIL REFUGE  SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   LET THOSE WHOM YOUR RIGHT HANDS POSSESS  AND THE  CHILDREN  AMONG YOU WHO HAVE NOT COME OF AGE ASK YOUR PERMISSION  BEFORE THEY COME TO YOUR PRESENCE   ON THREE OCCASIONS   BEFORE MORNING PRAYER   THE WHILE YE DOFF YOUR CLOTHES FOR THE NOONDAY HEAT   AND AFTER THE LATE NIGHT PRAYER   THESE ARE YOUR THREE TIMES OF UNDRESS   OUTSIDE THOSE TIMES IT IS NOT WRONG FOR YOU OR FOR THEM TO MOVE ABOUT ATTENDING TO EACH OTHER   THUS DOES GOD MAKE CLEAR THE SIGNS TO YOU   FOR GOD IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM 
   BUT WHEN THE CHILDREN AMONG YOU COME OF AGE  LET THEM  ALSO  ASK FOR PERMISSION  AS DO THOSE SENIOR TO THEM  IN AGE    THUS DOES GOD MAKE CLEAR HIS SIGNS TO YOU   FOR GOD IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM 
   SUCH ELDERLY WOMEN AS ARE PAST THE PROSPECT OF MARRIAGE   THERE IS NO BLAME ON THEM IF THEY LAY ASIDE THEIR  OUTER  GARMENTS  PROVIDED THEY MAKE NOT A WANTON DISPLAY OF THEIR BEAUTY   BUT IT IS BEST FOR THEM TO BE MODEST   AND GOD IS ONE WHO SEES AND KNOWS ALL THINGS 
   IT IS NO FAULT IN THE BLIND NOR IN ONE BORN LAME  NOR IN ONE AFFLICTED WITH ILLNESS  NOR IN YOURSELVES  THAT YE SHOULD EAT IN YOUR OWN HOUSES  OR THOSE OF YOUR FATHERS  OR YOUR MOTHERS  OR YOUR BROTHERS  OR YOUR SISTERS  OR YOUR FATHER S BROTHERS OR YOUR FATHER S SISTERS  OR YOUR MOTHER S BROTHERS  OR YOUR MOTHER S SISTERS  OR IN HOUSES OF WHICH THE KEYS ARE IN YOUR POSSESSION  OR IN THE HOUSE OF A SINCERE FRIEND OF YOURS   THERE IS NO BLAME ON YOU  WHETHER YE EAT IN COMPANY OR SEPARATELY  BUT IF YE ENTER HOUSES  SALUTE EACH OTHER  A GREETING OF BLESSING AND PURITY AS FROM GOD  THUS DOES GOD MAKE CLEAR THE SIGNS TO YOU   THAT YE MAY UNDERSTAND SECTION  
   ONLY THOSE ARE BELIEVERS  WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND HIS APOSTLE   WHEN THEY ARE WITH HIM ON A MATTER REQUIRING COLLECTIVE ACTION  THEY DO NOT DEPART UNTIL THEY HAVE ASKED FOR HIS LEAVE   THOSE WHO ASK FOR THY LEAVE ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND HIS APOSTLE   SO WHEN THEY ASK FOR THY LEAVE  FOR SOME BUSINESS OF THEIRS  GIVE LEAVE TO THOSE OF THEM WHOM THOU WILT  AND ASK GOD FOR THEIR FORGIVENESS   FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   DEEM NOT THE SUMMONS OF THE APOSTLE AMONG YOURSELVES LIKE THE SUMMONS OF ONE OF YOU TO ANOTHER   GOD DOTH KNOW THOSE OF YOU WHO SLIP AWAY UNDER SHELTER OF SOME EXCUSE   THEN LET THOSE BEWARE WHO WITHSTAND THE APOSTLE S ORDER  LEST SOME TRIAL BEFALL THEM  OR A GRIEVOUS PENALTY BE INFLICTED ON THEM 
   BE QUITE SURE THAT TO GOD DOTH BELONG WHATEVER IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  WELL DOTH HE KNOW WHAT YE ARE INTENT UPON   AND ONE DAY THEY WILL BE BROUGHT BACK TO HIM  AND HE WILL TELL THEM THE TRUTH OF WHAT THEY DID   FOR GOD DOTH KNOW ALL THINGS 
   BLESSED IS HE WHO SENT DOWN THE CRITERION TO HIS SERVANT  THAT IT MAY BE AN ADMONITION TO ALL CREATURE   
    HE TO WHOM BELONGS THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   NO SON HAS HE BEGOTTEN  NOR HAS HE A PARTNER IN HIS DOMINION   IT IS HE WHO CREATED ALL THINGS  AND ORDERED THEM IN DUE PROPORTIONS 
    YET HAVE THEY TAKEN  BESIDES HIM  GODS THAT CAN CREATE NOTHING BUT ARE THEMSELVES CREATED   THAT HAVE NO CONTROL OF HURT OR GOOD TO THEMSELVES   NOR CAN THEY CONTROL DEATH NOR LIFE NOR RESURRECTION 
   BUT THE MISBELIEVERS SAY     NAUGHT IS THIS BUT A LIE WHICH HE HAS FORGED  AND OTHERS HAVE HELPED HIM AT IT   IN TRUTH IT IS THEY WHO HAVE PUT FORWARD AN INIQUITY AND A FALSEHOOD 
    AND THEY SAY     TALES OF THE ANCIENTS  WHICH HE HAS CAUSED TO BE WRITTEN   AND THEY ARE DICTATED BEFORE HIM MORNING AND EVENING  
    SAY     THE  QUR ĀN  WAS SENT DOWN BY HIM WHO KNOWS THE MYSTERY  THAT IS  IN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   VERILY HE IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL  
   AND THEY SAY     WHAT SORT OF AN APOSTLE IS THIS  WHO EATS FOOD  AND WALKS THROUGH THE STREETS   WHY HAS NOT AN ANGEL BEEN SENT DOWN TO HIM TO GIVE ADMONITION WITH HIM  
      OR  WHY  HAS NOT A TREASURE BEEN BESTOWED ON HIM  OR WHY HAS HE  NOT  A GARDEN FOR ENJOYMENT     THE WICKED SAY     YE FOLLOW NONE OTHER THAN A MAN BEWITCHED  
    SEE WHAT KINDS OF COMPARISONS THEY MAKE FOR THEE   BUT THEY HAVE GONE ASTRAY  AND NEVER A WAY WILL THEY BE ABLE TO FIND  SECTION  
   BLESSED IS HE WHO  IF THAT WERE HIS WILL  COULD GIVE THEE BETTER  THINGS  THAN THOSE  GARDENS BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW   AND HE COULD GIVE THEE PALACES  SECURE TO DWELL IN  
   NAY  THEY DENY THE HOUR  OF THE JUDGMENT TO COME    BUT WE HAVE PREPARED A BLAZING FIRE FOR SUCH AS DENY THE HOUR  
   WHEN IT SEES THEM FROM A PLACE FAR OFF  THEY WILL HEAR ITS FURY AND ITS RAGING SIGH 
   AND WHEN THEY ARE CAST  BOUND TOGETHER  INTO A CONSTRICTED PLACE THEREIN  THEY WILL PLEAD FOR DESTRUCTION THERE AND THEN  
     THIS DAY PLEAD NOT FOR A SINGLE DESTRUCTION   PLEAD FOR DESTRUCTION OFT REPEATED    
   SAY     IS THAT BEST  OR THE ETERNAL GARDEN  PROMISED TO THE RIGHTEOUS   FOR THEM  THAT IS A REWARD AS WELL AS A GOAL  OF ATTAINMENT  
     FOR THEM THERE WILL BE THEREIN ALL THAT THEY WISH FOR   THEY WILL DWELL  THERE  FOR AYE   A PROMISE TO BE PRAYED FOR FROM THY LORD  
   THE DAY HE WILL GATHER THEM TOGETHER AS WELL AS THOSE WHOM THEY WORSHIP BESIDES GOD  HE WILL ASK     WAS IT YE WHO LED THESE MY SERVANTS ASTRAY  OR DID THEY STRAY FROM THE PATH THEMSELVES    
   THEY WILL SAY     GLORY TO THEE   NOT MEET WAS IT FOR US THAT WE SHOULD TAKE FOR PROTECTORS OTHERS BESIDES THEE   BUT THOU DIDST BESTOW  ON THEM AND THEIR FATHERS  GOOD THINGS  IN LIFE   UNTIL THEY FORGOT THE MESSAGE   FOR THEY WERE A PEOPLE  WORTHLESS AND  LOST  
    GOD WILL SAY      NOW HAVE THEY PROVED YOU LIARS IN WHAT YE SAY   SO YE CANNOT AVERT  YOUR PENALTY  NOR  GET  HELP   AND WHOEVER AMONG YOU DOES WRONG  HIM SHALL WE CAUSE TO TASTE OF A GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   AND THE APOSTLES WHOM WE SENT BEFORE THEE WERE ALL  MEN  WHO ATE FOOD AND WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS   WE HAVE MADE SOME OF YOU AS A TRIAL FOR OTHERS   WILL YE HAVE PATIENCE   FOR GOD IS ONE WHO SEES  ALL THINGS  SECTION  
   SUCH AS FEAR NOT THE MEETING WITH US  FOR JUDGMENT  SAY     WHY ARE NOT THE ANGELS SENT DOWN TO US  OR  WHY  DO WE NOT SEE OUR LORD     INDEED THEY HAVE AN ARROGANT CONCEIT OF THEMSELVES  AND MIGHTY IS THE INSOLENCE OF THEIR IMPIETY  
   THE DAY THEY SEE THE ANGELS   NO JOY WILL THERE BE TO THE SINNERS THAT DAY   THE  ANGELS  WILL SAY     THERE IS A BARRIER FORBIDDEN  TO YOU  ALTOGETHER    
   AND WE SHALL TURN TO WHATEVER DEEDS THEY DID  IN THIS LIFE   AND WE SHALL MAKE SUCH DEEDS AS FLOATING DUST SCATTERED ABOUT 
   THE COMPANIONS OF THE GARDEN WILL BE WELL  THAT DAY  IN THEIR ABODE  AND HAVE THE FAIREST OF PLACES FOR REPOSE 
   THE DAY THE HEAVEN SHALL BE RENT ASUNDER WITH CLOUDS  AND ANGELS SHALL BE SENT DOWN  DESCENDING  IN RANKS   
   THAT DAY  THE DOMINION AS OF RIGHT AND TRUTH  SHALL BE  WHOLLY  FOR  GOD  MOST MERCIFUL   IT WILL BE A DAY OF DIRE DIFFICULTY FOR THE MISBELIEVERS 
   THE DAY THAT THE WRONG DOER WILL BITE AT HIS HANDS  HE WILL SAY    OH   WOULD THAT I HAD TAKEN A  STRAIGHT  PATH WITH THE APOSTLE  
     AH   WOE IS ME   WOULD THAT I HAD NEVER TAKEN SUCH A ONE FOR A FRIEND  
     HE DID LEAD ME ASTRAY FROM THE MESSAGE  OF GOD  AFTER IT HAD COME TO ME   AH   THE EVIL ONE IS BUT A TRAITOR TO MAN  
   THEN THE APOSTLE WILL SAY     O MY LORD   TRULY MY PEOPLE TOOK THIS QUR ĀN FOR JUST FOOLISH NONSENSE  
   THUS HAVE WE MADE FOR EVERY PROPHET AN ENEMY AMONG THE SINNERS   BUT ENOUGH IS THY LORD TO GUIDE AND TO HELP 
   THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH SAY     WHY IS NOT THE QUR ĀN REVEALED TO HIM ALL AT ONCE     THUS  IS IT REVEALED   THAT WE MAY STRENGTHEN THY HEART THEREBY  AND WE HAVE REHEARSED IT TO THEE IN SLOW  WELL ARRANGED STAGES  GRADUALLY 
   AND NO QUESTION DO THEY BRING TO THEE BUT WE REVEAL TO THEE THE TRUTH AND THE BEST EXPLANATION  THEREOF  
   THOSE WHO WILL BE GATHERED TO HELL  PRONE  ON THEIR FACES   THEY WILL BE IN AN EVIL PLIGHT  AND  AS TO PATH  MOST ASTRAY SECTION  
    BEFORE THIS   WE SENT MOSES THE BOOK  AND APPOINTED HIS BROTHER AARON WITH HIM AS MINISTER  
   AND WE COMMANDED     GO YE BOTH  TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE REJECTED OUR SIGNS     AND THOSE  PEOPLE  WE DESTROYED WITH UTTER DESTRUCTION 
   AND THE PEOPLE OF NOAH   WHEN THEY REJECTED THE APOSTLES  WE DROWNED THEM  AND WE MADE THEM AS A SIGN FOR MANKIND   AND WE HAVE PREPARED FOR  ALL  WRONG DOERS A GRIEVOUS PENALTY   
   AS ALSO  ĀD AND THAMŪD  AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE RASS  AND MANY A GENERATION BETWEEN THEM 
   TO TEACH ONE WE SET FORTH PARABLES AND EXAMPLES   AND EACH ONE WE BROKE TO UTTER ANNIHILATION  FOR THEIR SINS  
   AND THE  UNBELIEVERS  MUST INDEED HAVE PASSED BY THE TOWN ON WHICH WAS RAINED A SHOWER OF EVIL   DID THEY NOT THEN SEE IT  WITH THEIR OWN EYES    BUT THEY FEAR NOT THE RESURRECTION 
   WHEN THEY SEE THEE  THEY TREAT THEE NO OTHERWISE THAN IN MOCKERY     IS THIS THE ONE WHOM GOD HAS SENT AS AN APOSTLE    
     HE INDEED WOULD WELL NIGH HAVE MISLED US FROM OUR GODS  HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT WE WERE CONSTANT TO THEM     SOON WILL THEY KNOW  WHEN THEY SEE THE PENALTY  WHO IT IS THAT IS MOST MISLED IN PATH  
   SEEST THOU SUCH A ONE AS TAKETH FOR HIS GOD HIS OWN PASSION  OR IMPULSE    COULDST THOU BE A DISPOSER OF AFFAIRS FOR HIM  
   OR THINKEST THOU THAT MOST OF THEM LISTEN OR UNDERSTAND   THEY ARE ONLY LIKE CATTLE    NAY  THEY ARE WORSE ASTRAY IN PATH SECTION  
   HAST THOU NOT TURNED THY VISION TO THY LORD    HOW HE DOTH PROLONG THE SHADOW   IF HE WILLED  HE COULD MAKE IT STATIONARY   THEN DO WE MAKE THE SUN ITS GUIDE  
   THEN WE DRAW IT IN TOWARDS OURSELVES   A CONTRACTION BY EASY STAGES 
   AND HE IT IS WHO MAKES THE NIGHT AS A ROBE FOR YOU  AND SLEEP AS REPOSE  AND MAKES THE DAY  AS IT WERE  A RESURRECTION 
   AND HE IT IS WHO SENDS THE WINDS AS HERALDS OF GLAD TIDINGS  GOING BEFORE HIS MERCY  AND WE SEND DOWN PURIFYING WATER FROM THE SKY  
   THAT WITH IT WE MAY GIVE LIFE TO A DEAD LAND  AND SLAKE THE THIRST OF THINGS WE HAVE CREATED   CATTLE AND MEN IN GREAT NUMBERS 
   AND WE HAVE DISTRIBUTED THE  WATER  AMONGST THEM  IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY CELEBRATE  OUR  PRAISES  BUT MOST MEN ARE AVERSE  TO AUGHT  BUT  RANK  INGRATITUDE 
   HAD IT BEEN OUR WILL  WE COULD HAVE SENT A WARNER TO EVERY CENTRE OF POPULATION
   THEREFORE LISTEN NOT TO THE UNBELIEVERS  BUT STRIVE AGAINST THEM WITH THE UTMOST STRENUOUSNESS  WITH THE  QUR ĀN  
   IT IS HE WHO HAS LET FREE THE TWO BODIES OF FLOWING WATER   ONE PALATABLE AND SWEET  AND THE OTHER SALT AND BITTER   YET HAS HE MADE A BARRIER BETWEEN THEM  A PARTITION THAT IS FORBIDDEN TO BE PASSED 
   IT IS HE WHO HAS CREATED MAN FROM WATER   THEN HAS HE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS OF LINEAGE AND MARRIAGE   FOR THY LORD HAS POWER  OVER ALL THINGS  
   YET DO THEY WORSHIP  BESIDES GOD  THINGS THAT CAN NEITHER PROFIT THEM NOR HARM THEM   AND THE MISBELIEVER IS A HELPER  OF EVIL   AGAINST HIS OWN LORD  
   BUT THEE WE ONLY SENT TO GIVE GLAD TIDINGS AND ADMONITION 
   SAY     NO REWARD DO I ASK OF YOU FOR IT BUT THIS   THAT EACH ONE WHO WILL MAY TAKE A  STRAIGHT  PATH TO HIS LORD  
   AND PUT THY TRUST IN HIM WHO LIVES AND DIES NOT   AND CELEBRATE HIS PRAISE   AND ENOUGH IS HE TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE FAULTS OF HIS SERVANTS   
   HE WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL THAT IS BETWEEN  IN SIX DAYS  AND IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED ON THE THRONE  OF AUTHORITY    GOD MOST GRACIOUS   ASK THOU  THEN  ABOUT HIM OF ANY ACQUAINTED  WITH SUCH THINGS  
   WHEN IT IS SAID TO THEM    ADORE YE  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS      THEY SAY    AND WHAT IS  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS   SHALL WE ADORE THAT WHICH THOU COMMANDEST US     AND IT INCREASES THEIR FLIGHT  FROM THE TRUTH  SECTION  
   BLESSED IS HE WHO MADE CONSTELLATIONS IN THE SKIES  AND PLACED THEREIN A LAMP AND A MOON GIVING LIGHT  
   AND IT IS HE WHO MADE THE NIGHT AND THE DAY TO FOLLOW EACH OTHER   FOR SUCH AS HAVE THE WILL TO CELEBRATE HIS PRAISES OR TO SHOW THEIR GRATITUDE 
   AND THE SERVANTS OF  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS ARE THOSE WHO WALK ON THE EARTH IN HUMILITY  AND WHEN THE IGNORANT ADDRESS THEM  THEY SAY    PEACE      
   THOSE WHO SPEND THE NIGHT IN ADORATION OF THEIR LORD PROSTRATE AND STANDING  
   THOSE WHO SAY    OUR LORD   AVERT FROM US THE WRATH OF HELL  FOR ITS WRATH IS INDEED AN AFFLICTION GRIEVOUS  
     EVIL INDEED IS IT AS AN ABODE  AND AS A PLACE TO REST IN    
   THOSE WHO  WHEN THEY SPEND  ARE NOT EXTRAVAGANT AND NOT NIGGARDLY  BUT HOLD A JUST  BALANCE  BETWEEN THOSE  EXTREMES   
   THOSE WHO INVOKE NOT  WITH GOD  ANY OTHER GOD  NOR SLAY SUCH LIFE AS GOD HAS MADE SACRED  EXCEPT FOR JUST CAUSE  NOT COMMIT FORNICATION   AND ANY THAT DOES THIS  NOT ONLY  MEETS PUNISHMENT
    BUT  THE PENALTY ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT WILL BE DOUBLED TO HIM  AND HE WILL DWELL THEREIN IN IGNOMINY  
   UNLESS HE REPENTS  BELIEVES  AND WORKS RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  FOR GOD WILL CHANGE THE EVIL OF SUCH PERSONS INTO GOOD  AND GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   AND WHOEVER REPENTS AND DOES GOOD HAS TRULY TURNED TO GOD WITH AN  ACCEPTABLE  CONVERSION   
   THOSE WHO WITNESS NO FALSEHOOD  AND  IF THEY PASS BY FUTILITY  THEY PASS BY IT WITH HONOURABLE  AVOIDANCE   
   THOSE WHO  WHEN THEY ARE ADMONISHED WITH THE SIGNS OF THEIR LORD  DROOP NOT DOWN AT THEM AS IF THEY WERE DEAF OR BLIND  
   AND THOSE WHO PRAY    OUR LORD   GRANT UNTO US WIVES AND OFFSPRING WHO WILL BE THE COMFORT OF OUR EYES  AND GIVE US  THE GRACE  TO LEAD THE RIGHTEOUS  
   THOSE ARE THE ONES WHO WILL BE REWARDED WITH THE HIGHEST PLACE IN HEAVEN  BECAUSE OF THEIR PATIENT CONSTANCY   THEREIN SHALL THEY BE MET WITH SALUTATIONS AND PEACE 
   DWELLING THEREIN   HOW BEAUTIFUL AN ABODE AND PLACE OF REST  
   SAY  TO THE REJECTERS      MY LORD IS NOT UNEASY BECAUSE OF YOU IF YE CALL NOT ON HIM   BUT YE HAVE INDEED REJECTED  HIM   AND SOON WILL COME THE INEVITABLE  PUNISHMENT     
   TĀ  SĪN  MĪM 
   THESE ARE VERSES OF THE BOOK THAT MAKES  THINGS  CLEAR 
   IT MAY BE THOU FRETTEST THY SOUL WITH GRIEF  THAT THEY DO NOT BECOME BELIEVERS 
   IF  SUCH  WERE OUR WILL  WE COULD SEND DOWN TO THEM FROM THE SKY A SIGN  TO WHICH THEY WOULD BEND THEIR NECKS IN HUMILITY 
   BUT THERE COMES NOT TO THEM A NEWLY REVEALED MESSAGE FROM  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  BUT THEY TURN AWAY THEREFROM 
   THEY HAVE INDEED REJECTED  THE MESSAGE    SO THEY WILL KNOW SOON  ENOUGH  THE TRUTH OF WHAT THEY MOCKED AT  
   DO THEY NOT LOOK AT THE EARTH  HOW MANY NOBLE THINGS OF ALL KINDS WE HAVE PRODUCED THEREIN  
   VERILY  IN THIS IS A SIGN   BUT MOST OF THEM DO NOT BELIEVE 
   AND VERILY  THY LORD IS HE  THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  MOST MERCIFUL SECTION  
   BEHOLD  THY LORD CALLED MOSES     GO TO THE PEOPLE OF INIQUITY  
     THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH   WILL THEY NOT FEAR GOD    
   HE SAID     O MY LORD   I DO FEAR THAT THEY WILL CHARGE ME WITH FALSEHOOD  
     MY BREAST WILL BE STRAITENED  AND MY SPEECH MAY NOT GO  SMOOTHLY    SO SEND UNTO AARON 
     AND  FURTHER   THEY HAVE A CHARGE OF CRIME AGAINST ME   AND I FEAR THEY MAY SLAY ME  
   GOD SAID     BY NO MEANS   PROCEED THEN  BOTH OF YOU  WITH OUR SIGNS   WE ARE WITH YOU  AND WILL LISTEN  TO YOUR CALL  
     SO GO FORTH  BOTH OF YOU  TO PHARAOH  AND SAY     WE HAVE BEEN SENT BY THE LORD AND CHERISHER OF THE WORLDS  
       SEND THOU WITH US THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL    
    PHARAOH  SAID     DID WE NOT CHERISH THEE AS A CHILD AMONG US  AND DIDST THOU NOT STAY IN OUR MIDST MANY YEARS OF THY LIFE  
     AND THOU DIDST A DEED OF THINE WHICH  THOU KNOWEST  THOU DIDST  AND THOU ART AN UNGRATEFUL  WRETCH     
   MOSES     I DID IT THEN  WHEN I WAS IN ERROR 
     SO I FLED FROM YOU  ALL  WHEN I FEARED YOU   BUT MY LORD HAS  SINCE  INVESTED ME WITH JUDGMENT  AND WISDOM  AND APPOINTED ME AS ONE OF THE APOSTLES 
     AND THIS IS THE FAVOUR WITH WHICH THOU DOST REPROACH ME  THAT THOU HAST ENSLAVED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL    
   PHARAOH SAID     AND WHAT IS THE   LORD AND CHERISHER OF THE WORLDS      
    MOSES  SAID     THE LORD AND CHERISHER OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND ALL BETWEEN  IF YE WANT TO BE QUITE SURE  
    PHARAOH  SAID TO THOSE AROUND     DO YE NOT LISTEN  TO WHAT HE SAYS     
    MOSES  SAID     YOUR LORD AND THE LORD OF YOUR FATHERS FROM THE BEGINNING    
    PHARAOH  SAID     TRULY YOUR APOSTLE WHO HAS BEEN SENT TO YOU IS A VERITABLE MADMAN    
    MOSES  SAID     LORD OF THE EAST AND THE WEST  AND ALL BETWEEN   IF YE ONLY HAD SENSE    
    PHARAOH  SAID     IF THOU DOST PUT FORWARD ANY GOD OTHER THAN ME  I WILL CERTAINLY PUT THEE IN PRISON    
    MOSES  SAID     EVEN IF I SHOWED YOU SOMETHING CLEAR  AND  CONVINCING    
    PHARAOH  SAID     SHOW IT THEN  IF THOU TELLEST THE TRUTH    
   SO  MOSES  THREW HIS ROD  AND BEHOLD  IT WAS A SERPENT  PLAIN  FOR ALL TO SEE   
   AND HE DREW OUT HIS HAND  AND BEHOLD  IT WAS WHITE TO ALL BEHOLDERS  SECTION  
    PHARAOH  SAID TO THE CHIEFS AROUND HIM     THIS IS INDEED A SORCERER WELL VERSED  
     HIS PLAN IS TO GET YOU OUT OF YOUR LAND BY HIS SORCERY   THEN WHAT IS IT YE COUNSEL    
   THEY SAID     KEEP HIM AND HIS BROTHER IN SUSPENSE  FOR A WHILE   AND DISPATCH TO THE CITIES HERALDS TO COLLECT 
     AND BRING UP TO THEE ALL  OUR  SORCERERS WELL VERSED  
   SO THE SORCERERS WERE GOT TOGETHER FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A DAY WELL KNOWN 
   AND THE PEOPLE WERE TOLD     ARE YE  NOW  ASSEMBLED   
     THAT WE MAY FOLLOW THE SORCERERS  IN RELIGION  IF THEY WIN    
   SO WHEN THE SORCERERS ARRIVED  THEY SAID TO PHARAOH     OF COURSE SHALL WE HAVE A  SUITABLE  REWARD IF WE WIN    
   HE SAID     YEA   AND MORE    FOR YE SHALL IN THAT CASE BE  RAISED TO POSTS  NEAREST  TO MY PERSON   
   MOSES SAID TO THEM     THROW YE THAT WHICH YE ARE ABOUT TO THROW    
   SO THEY THREW THEIR ROPES AND THEIR RODS  AND SAID     BY THE MIGHT OF PHARAOH  IT IS WE WHO WILL CERTAINLY WIN    
   THEN MOSES THREW HIS ROD WHEN  BEHOLD  IT STRAIGHTWAY SWALLOWS UP ALL THE FALSEHOODS WHICH THEY FAKE  
   THEN DID THE SORCERERS FALL DOWN  PROSTRATE IN ADORATION 
   SAYING     WE BELIEVE IN THE LORD OF THE WORLDS 
     THE LORD OF MOSES AND AARON  
   SAID  PHARAOH      BELIEVE YE IN HIM BEFORE I GIVE YOU PERMISSION   SURELY HE IS YOUR LEADER  WHO HAS TAUGHT YOU SORCERY   BUT SOON SHALL YE KNOW   BE SURE I WILL CUT OFF YOUR HANDS AND YOUR FEET ON OPPOSITE SIDES  AND I WILL CAUSE YOU ALL TO DIE ON THE CROSS    
   THEY SAID     NO MATTER   FOR US  WE SHALL BUT RETURN TO OUR LORD  
     ONLY  OUR DESIRE IS THAT OUR LORD WILL FORGIVE US OUR FAULTS  THAT WE MAY BECOME FOREMOST AMONG THE BELIEVERS    SECTION  
   BY INSPIRATION WE TOLD MOSES     TRAVEL BY NIGHT WITH MY SERVANTS   FOR SURELY YE SHALL BE PURSUED  
   THEN PHARAOH SENT HERALDS TO  ALL  THE CITIES 
    SAYING      THESE  ISRAELITES  ARE BUT A SMALL BAND 
     AND THEY ARE RAGING FURIOUSLY AGAINST US  
     BUT WE ARE A MULTITUDE AMPLY FORE WARNED  
   SO WE EXPELLED THEM FROM GARDENS  SPRINGS 
   TREASURES  AND EVERY KIND OF HONOURABLE POSITION  
   THUS IT WAS  BUT WE MADE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL INHERITORS OF SUCH THINGS 
   SO THEY PURSUED THEM AT SUNRISE 
   AND WHEN THE TWO BODIES SAW EACH OTHER  THE PEOPLE OF MOSES SAID     WE ARE SURE TO BE OVERTAKEN  
    MOSES  SAID     BY NO MEANS   MY LORD IS WITH ME   SOON WILL HE GUIDE ME    
   THEN WE TOLD MOSES BY INSPIRATION     STRIKE THE SEA WITH THY ROD   SO IT DIVIDED  AND EACH SEPARATE PART BECOME LIKE THE HUGE  FIRM MASS OF A MOUNTAIN 
   AND WE MADE THE OTHER PARTY APPROACH THITHER 
   WE DELIVERED MOSES AND ALL WHO WERE WITH HIM  
   BUT WE DROWNED THE OTHERS 
   VERILY IN THIS IS A SIGN   BUT MOST OF THEM DO NOT BELIEVE 
   AND VERILY THY LORD IS HE  THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  MOST MERCIFUL SECTION  
   AND REHEARSE TO THEM  SOMETHING OF  ABRAHAM S STORY 
   BEHOLD  HE SAID TO HIS FATHER AND HIS PEOPLE     WHAT WORSHIP YE    
   THEY SAID     WE WORSHIP IDOLS  AND WE REMAIN CONSTANTLY IN ATTENDANCE ON THEM  
   HE SAID     DO THEY LISTEN TO YOU WHEN YE CALL  ON THEM  
     OR DO YOU GOOD OR HARM    
   THEY SAID     NAY  BUT WE FOUND OUR FATHERS DOING THUS  WHAT WE DO   
   HE SAID     DO YE THEN SEE WHOM YE HAVE BEEN WORSHIPPING  
     YE AND YOUR FATHERS BEFORE YOU   
     FOR THEY ARE ENEMIES TO ME   NOT SO THE LORD AND CHERISHER OF THE WORLDS  
     WHO CREATED ME  AND IT IS HE WHO GUIDES ME  
     WHO GIVES ME FOOD AND DRINK 
     AND WHEN I AM ILL  IT IS HE WHO CURES ME  
     WHO WILL CAUSE ME TO DIE  AND THEN TO LIVE  AGAIN   
     AND WHO  I HOPE  WILL FORGIVE ME MY FAULTS ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 
   O MY LORD   BESTOW WISDOM ON ME  AND JOIN ME WITH THE RIGHTEOUS  
     GRANT ME HONOURABLE MENTION ON THE TONGUE OF TRUTH AMONG THE LATEST  GENERATIONS   
     MAKE ME ONE OF THE INHERITORS OF THE GARDEN OF BLISS  
     FORGIVE MY FATHER  FOR THAT HE IS AMONG THOSE ASTRAY  
     AND LET ME NOT BE IN DISGRACE ON THE DAY WHEN  MEN  WILL BE RAISED UP   
     THE DAY WHEREON NEITHER WEALTH NOR SONS WILL AVAIL 
     BUT ONLY HE  WILL PROSPER  THAT BRINGS TO GOD A SOUND HEART  
     TO THE RIGHTEOUS  THE GARDEN WILL BE BROUGHT NEAR 
     AND TO THOSE STRAYING IN EVIL  THE FIRE WILL BE PLACED IN FULL VIEW  
     AND IT SHALL BE SAID TO THEM     WHERE ARE THE  GODS  YE WORSHIPPED 
       BESIDES GOD   CAN THEY HELP YOU OR HELP THEMSELVES    
     THEN THEY WILL BE THROWN HEADLONG INTO THE  FIRE    THEY AND THOSE STRAYING IN EVIL 
     AND THE WHOLE HOSTS OF IBLĪS TOGETHER 
     THEY WILL SAY THERE IN THEIR MUTUAL BICKERINGS  
       BY GOD  WE WERE TRULY IN AN ERROR MANIFEST 
       WHEN WE HELD YOU AS EQUALS WITH THE LORD OF THE WORLDS  
       AND OUR SEDUCERS WERE ONLY THOSE WHO WERE STEEPED IN GUILT 
       NOW  THEN  WE HAVE NONE TO INTERCEDE  FOR US  
       NOR A SINGLE FRIEND TO FEEL  FOR US  
       NOW IF WE ONLY HAD A CHANCE OF RETURN  WE SHALL TRULY BE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE

   VERILY THIS IS A REVELATION FROM THE LORD OF THE WORLDS  
   WITH IT CAME DOWN THE SPIRIT OF FAITH AND TRUTH 
   TO THY HEART AND MIND  THAT THOU MAYEST ADMONISH
   IN THE PERSPICUOUS ARABIC TONGUE 
   WITHOUT DOUBT IT IS  ANNOUNCED  IN THE MYSTIC BOOKS OF FORMER PEOPLES 
   IS IT NOT A SIGN TO THEM THAT THE LEARNED OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL KNEW IT  AS TRUE   
   HAD WE REVEALED IT TO ANY OF THE NON ARABS 
   AND HAD HE RECITED IT TO THEM  THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IN IT 
   THUS HAVE WE CAUSED IT TO ENTER THE HEARTS OF THE SINNERS 
   THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE IN IT UNTIL THEY SEE THE GRIEVOUS PENALTY  
   BUT THE  PENALTY  WILL COME TO THEM OF A SUDDEN  WHILE THEY PERCEIVE IT NOT  
   THEN THEY WILL SAY     SHALL WE BE RESPITED    
   DO THEY THEN ASK FOR OUR PENALTY TO BE HASTENED ON  
   SEEST THOU   IF WE DO LET THEM ENJOY  THIS LIFE  FOR A FEW YEARS 
   YET THERE COMES TO THEM AT LENGTH THE  PUNISHMENT  WHICH THEY WERE PROMISED  
   IT WILL PROFIT THEM NOT THAT THEY ENJOYED  THIS LIFE   
   NEVER DID WE DESTROY A POPULATION  BUT HAD ITS WARNERS 
   BY WAY OF REMINDER   AND WE NEVER ARE UNJUST 
   NO EVIL ONES HAVE BROUGHT DOWN THIS  REVELATION   
   IT WOULD NEITHER SUIT THEM NOR WOULD THEY BE ABLE  TO PRODUCE IT  
   INDEED THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FAR FROM EVEN  A CHANCE OF  HEARING IT 
   SO CALL NOT ON ANY OTHER GOD WITH GOD  OR THOU WILT BE AMONG THOSE UNDER THE PENALTY 
   AND ADMONISH THY NEAREST KINSMEN 
   AND LOWER THY WING TO THE BELIEVERS WHO FOLLOW THEE 
   THEN IF THEY DISOBEY THEE  SAY     I AM FREE  OF RESPONSIBILITY  FOR WHAT YE DO    
   AND PUT THY TRUST ON THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  THE MERCIFUL  
   WHO SEETH THEE STANDING FORTH  IN PRAYER  
   AND THY MOVEMENTS AMONG THOSE WHO PROSTRATE THEMSELVES 
   FOR IT IS HE WHO HEARETH AND KNOWETH ALL THINGS

   THEY DESCEND ON EVERY LYING  WICKED PERSON 
    INTO WHOSE EARS  THEY POUR HEARSAY VANITIES  AND MOST OF THEM ARE LIARS 
   AND THE POETS   IT IS THOSE STRAYING IN EVIL  WHO FOLLOW THEM  
   SEEST THOU NOT THAT THEY WANDER DISTRACTED IN EVERY VALLEY   
   AND THAT THEY SAY WHAT THEY PRACTICE NOT   
   EXCEPT THOSE WHO BELIEVE  WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS  ENGAGE MUCH IN THE REMEMBRANCE OF GOD  AND DEFEND THEMSELVES ONLY AFTER THEY ARE UNJUSTLY ATTACKED  AND SOON WILL THE UNJUST ASSAILANTS KNOW WHAT VICISSITUDES THEIR AFFAIRS WILL TAKE  
   TĀ  SĪN  THESE ARE VERSES OF THE QUR ĀN  A BOOK THAT MAKES  THINGS  CLEAR  
    A GUIDE   AND GLAD TIDINGS FOR THE BELIEVERS  
    THOSE WHO ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS AND GIVE IN REGULAR CHARITY  AND ALSO HAVE  FULL  ASSURANCE OF THE HEREAFTER 
    AS TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT IN THE HEREAFTER  WE HAVE MADE THEIR DEEDS PLEASING IN THEIR EYES   AND SO THEY WANDER ABOUT IN DISTRACTION 
    SUCH ARE THEY FOR WHOM A GRIEVOUS PENALTY IS  WAITING    AND IN THE HEREAFTER THEIRS WILL BE THE GREATEST LOSS 
    AS TO THEE  THE QUR ĀN IS BESTOWED UPON THEE FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO IS WISE AND ALL KNOWING 
   BEHOLD   MOSES SAID TO HIS FAMILY     I PERCEIVE A FIRE   SOON WILL I BRING YOU FROM THERE SOME INFORMATION  OR I WILL BRING YOU A BURNING BRAND TO LIGHT OUR FUEL  THAT YE MAY WARM YOURSELVES  
    BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE  FIRE   A VOICE WAS HEARD     BLESSED ARE THOSE IN THE FIRE AND THOSE AROUND   AND GLORY TO GOD  THE LORD OF THE WORLDS 
      O MOSES   VERILY  I AM GOD  THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  THE WISE   
     NOW DO THOU THROW THY ROD     BUT WHEN HE SAW IT MOVING  OF ITS OWN ACCORD  AS IF IT HAD BEEN A SNAKE  HE TURNED BACK IN RETREAT  AND RETRACED NOT HIS STEPS     O MOSES      IT WAS SAID     FEAR NOT   TRULY  IN MY PRESENCE  THOSE CALLED AS APOSTLES HAVE NO FEAR  
     BUT IF ANY HAVE DONE WRONG AND HAVE THEREAFTER SUBSTITUTED GOOD TO TAKE THE PLACE OF EVIL  TRULY  I AM OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
     NOW PUT THY HAND INTO THY BOSOM  AND IT WILL COME FORTH WHITE WITHOUT STAIN  OR HARM     THESE ARE  AMONG THE NINE SIGNS  THOU WILT TAKE  TO PHARAOH AND HIS PEOPLE   FOR THEY ARE A PEOPLE REBELLIOUS IN TRANSGRESSION  
   BUT WHEN OUR SIGNS CAME TO THEM  THAT SHOULD HAVE OPENED THEIR EYES  THEY SAID     THIS IS SORCERY MANIFEST    
   AND THEY REJECTED THOSE SIGNS IN INIQUITY AND ARROGANCE  THOUGH THEIR SOULS WERE CONVINCED THEREOF   SO SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE WHO ACTED CORRUPTLY  SECTION  
   WE GAVE  IN THE PAST  KNOWLEDGE TO DAVID AND SOLOMON   AND THEY BOTH SAID     PRAISE BE TO GOD  WHO HAS FAVOURED US ABOVE MANY OF HIS SERVANTS WHO BELIEVE    
   AND SOLOMON WAS DAVID S HEIR  HE SAID     O YE PEOPLE   WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THE SPEECH OF BIRDS  AND ON US HAS BEEN BESTOWED  A LITTLE  OF ALL THINGS   THIS IS INDEED GRACE MANIFEST  FROM GOD    
   AND BEFORE SOLOMON WERE MARSHALLED HIS HOSTS  OF JINNS AND MEN AND BIRDS  AND THEY WERE ALL KEPT IN ORDER AND RANKS 
   AT LENGTH  WHEN THEY CAME TO A  LOWLY  VALLEY OF ANTS  ONE OF THE ANTS SAID     O YE ANTS  GET INTO YOUR HABITATIONS  LEST SOLOMON AND HIS HOSTS CRUSH YOU  UNDER FOOT  WITHOUT KNOWING IT  
   SO HE SMILED  AMUSED AT HER SPEECH   AND HE SAID    O MY LORD   SO ORDER ME THAT I MAY BE GRATEFUL FOR THY FAVOURS  WHICH THOU HAST BESTOWED ON ME AND ON MY PARENTS  AND THAT I MAY WORK THE RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT WILL PLEASE THEE   AND ADMIT ME  BY THY GRACE  TO THE RANKS OF THY RIGHTEOUS SERVANTS  
   AND HE TOOK A MUSTER OF THE BIRDS   AND HE SAID     WHY IS IT I SEE NOT THE HOOPOE   OR IS HE AMONG THE ABSENTEES  
     I WILL CERTAINLY PUNISH HIM WITH A SEVERE PENALTY  OR EXECUTE HIM  UNLESS HE BRING ME A CLEAR REASON  FOR ABSENCE   
   BUT THE HOOPOE TARRIED NOT FAR   HE  CAME UP AND  SAID     I HAVE COMPASSED  TERRITORY  WHICH THOU HAST NOT COMPASSED  AND I HAVE COME TO THEE FROM SABĀ WITH TIDINGS TRUE 
     I FOUND  THERE  A WOMAN RULING OVER THEM AND PROVIDED WITH EVERY REQUISITE   AND SHE HAS A MAGNIFICENT THRONE 
     I FOUND HER AND HER PEOPLE WORSHIPPING THE SUN BESIDES GOD   SATAN HAS MADE THEIR DEEDS SEEM PLEASING IN THEIR EYES  AND HAS KEPT THEM AWAY FROM THE PATH  SO THEY RECEIVE NO GUIDANCE  
      KEPT THEM AWAY FROM THE PATH   THAT THEY SHOULD NOT WORSHIP GOD  WHO BRINGS TO LIGHT WHAT IS HIDDEN IN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND KNOWS WHAT YE HIDE AND WHAT YE REVEAL 
     GOD   THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE   LORD OF THE THRONE SUPREME    
    SOLOMON  SAID     SOON SHALL WE SEE WHETHER THOU HAST TOLD THE TRUTH OR LIED  
     GO THOU  WITH THIS LETTER OF MINE  AND DELIVER IT TO THEM   THEN DRAW BACK FROM THEM  AND  WAIT TO  SEE WHAT ANSWER THEY RETURN   
    THE QUEEN  SAID     YE CHIEFS   HERE IS DELIVERED TO ME  A LETTER WORTHY OF RESPECT 
     IT IS FROM SOLOMON  AND IS  AS FOLLOWS      IN THE NAME OF GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  MOST MERCIFUL  
       BE YE NOT ARROGANT AGAINST ME  BUT COME TO ME IN SUBMISSION  TO THE TRUE RELIGION     SECTION  
   SHE SAID     YE CHIEFS   ADVISE ME IN  THIS  MY AFFAIR   NO AFFAIR HAVE I DECIDED EXCEPT IN YOUR PRESENCE  
   THEY SAID     WE ARE ENDUED WITH STRENGTH  AND GIVEN TO VEHEMENT WAR   BUT THE COMMAND IS WITH THEE   SO CONSIDER WHAT THOU WILT COMMAND  
   SHE SAID     KINGS  WHEN THEY ENTER A COUNTRY  DESPOIL IT  AND MAKE THE NOBLEST OF ITS PEOPLE ITS MEANEST   THUS DO THEY BEHAVE 
     BUT I AM GOING TO SEND HIM A PRESENT  AND  WAIT  TO SEE WITH WHAT  ANSWER  RETURN  MY  AMBASSADORS  
   NOW WHEN  THE EMBASSY  CAME TO SOLOMON  HE SAID     WILL YE GIVE ME ABUNDANCE IN WEALTH   BUT THAT WHICH GOD HAS GIVEN ME IS BETTER THAN THAT WHICH HE HAS GIVEN YOU   NAY IT IS YE WHO REJOICE IN YOUR GIFT  
     GO BACK TO THEM  AND BE SURE WE SHALL COME TO THEM WITH SUCH HOSTS AS THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO MEET   WE SHALL EXPEL THEM FROM THERE IN DISGRACE  AND THEY WILL FEEL HUMBLED  INDEED   
   HE SAID  TO HIS OWN MEN      YE CHIEFS   WHICH OF YOU CAN BRING ME HER THRONE BEFORE THEY COME TO ME IN SUBMISSION    
   SAID AN  IFRĪT  OF THE JINNS     I WILL BRING IT TO THEE BEFORE THOU RISE FROM THY COUNCIL   INDEED I HAVE FULL STRENGTH FOR THE PURPOSE  AND MAY BE TRUSTED  
   SAID ONE WHO HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE BOOK     I WILL BRING IT TO THEE WITHIN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE     THEN WHEN  SOLOMON  SAW IT PLACED FIRMLY BEFORE HIM  HE SAID     THIS IS BY THE GRACE OF MY LORD    TO TEST ME WHETHER I AM GRATEFUL OR UNGRATEFUL   AND IF ANY IS GRATEFUL  TRULY HIS GRATITUDE IS  A GAIN  FOR HIS OWN SOUL   BUT IF ANY IS UNGRATEFUL  TRULY MY LORD IS FREE OF ALL NEEDS  SUPREME IN HONOUR    
   HE SAID     TRANSFORM HER THRONE OUT OF ALL RECOGNITION BY HER   LET US SEE WHETHER SHE IS GUIDED  TO THE TRUTH  OR IS ONE OF THOSE WHO RECEIVE NO GUIDANCE  
   SO WHEN SHE ARRIVED  SHE WAS ASKED    IS THIS THY THRONE     SHE SAID    IT WAS JUST LIKE THIS   AND KNOWLEDGE WAS BESTOWED ON US IN ADVANCE OF THIS  AND WE HAVE SUBMITTED TO GOD  IN ISLĀM   
   AND HE DIVERTED HER FROM THE WORSHIP OF OTHERS BESIDES GOD   FOR SHE WAS  SPRUNG  OF A PEOPLE THAT HAD NO FAITH 
   SHE WAS ASKED TO ENTER THAT LOFTY PALACE   BUT WHEN SHE SAW IT  SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A LAKE OF WATER  AND SHE  TUCKED UP HER SKIRTS   UNCOVERING HER LEGS  HE SAID     THIS IS BUT A PALACE PAVED SMOOTH WITH SLABS OF GLASS   SHE SAID     O MY LORD   I HAVE INDEED WRONGED MY SOUL   I DO  NOW  SUBMIT  IN ISLĀM   WITH SOLOMON  TO THE LORD OF THE WORLDS  SECTION  
   WE SENT  AFORETIME   TO THE THAMŪD  THEIR BROTHER ṢĀLIḤ  SAYING    SERVE GOD     BUT BEHOLD  THEY BECAME TWO FACTIONS QUARRELLING WITH EACH OTHER 
   HE SAID     O MY PEOPLE   WHY ASK YE TO HASTEN ON THE EVIL IN PREFERENCE TO THE GOOD   IF ONLY YE ASK GOD FOR FORGIVENESS  YE MAY HOPE TO RECEIVE MERCY  
   THEY SAID     ILL OMEN DO WE AUGUR FROM THEE AND THOSE THAT ARE WITH THEE    HE SAID     YOUR ILL OMEN IS WITH GOD   YEA  YE ARE A PEOPLE UNDER TRIAL  
   THERE WERE IN THE CITY NINE MEN OF A FAMILY  WHO MADE MISCHIEF IN THE LAND  AND WOULD NOT REFORM 
   THEY SAID     SWEAR A MUTUAL OATH BY GOD THAT WE SHALL MAKE A SECRET NIGHT ATTACK ON HIM AND HIS PEOPLE  AND THAT WE SHALL THEN SAY TO HIS HEIR  WHEN HE SEEKS VENGEANCE      WE WERE NOT PRESENT AT THE SLAUGHTER OF HIS PEOPLE  AND WE ARE POSITIVELY TELLING THE TRUTH    
   THEY PLOTTED AND PLANNED  BUT WE TOO PLANNED  EVEN WHILE THEY PERCEIVED IT NOT 
   THEN SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THEIR PLOT   THIS  THAT WE DESTROYED THEM AND THEIR PEOPLE  ALL  OF THEM  
   NOW SUCH WERE THEIR HOUSES   IN UTTER RUIN  BECAUSE THEY PRACTICED WRONG DOING  VERILY IN THIS IS A SIGN FOR PEOPLE OF KNOWLEDGE 
   AND WE SAVED THOSE WHO BELIEVED AND PRACTICED RIGHTEOUSNESS 
    WE ALSO SENT  LŪṬ  AS AN APOSTLE    BEHOLD  HE SAID TO HIS PEOPLE    DO YE DO WHAT IS SHAMEFUL THOUGH YE SEE  ITS INIQUITY   
     WOULD YE REALLY APPROACH MEN IN YOUR LUSTS RATHER THAN WOMEN   NAY  YE ARE A PEOPLE  GROSSLY  IGNORANT    
   BUT HIS PEOPLE GAVE NO OTHER ANSWER BUT THIS   THEY SAID    DRIVE OUT THE FOLLOWERS OF LŪṬ FROM YOUR CITY   THESE ARE INDEED MEN WHO WANT TO BE CLEAN AND PURE    
   BUT WE SAVED HIM AND HIS FAMILY  EXCEPT HIS WIFE   HER WE DESTINED TO BE OF THOSE WHO LAGGED BEHIND 
   AND WE RAINED DOWN ON THEM A SHOWER  OF BRIMSTONE    AND EVIL WAS THE SHOWER ON THOSE WHO WERE ADMONISHED  BUT HEEDED NOT   SECTION  
   SAY   PRAISE BE TO GOD  AND PEACE ON HIS SERVANTS WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN  FOR HIS MESSAGE    WHO  IS BETTER   GOD OR THE FALSE GODS THEY ASSOCIATE  WITH HIM   
   OR  WHO HAS CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND WHO SENDS YOU DOWN RAIN FROM THE SKY   YEA  WITH IT WE CAUSE TO GROW WELL PLANTED ORCHARDS FULL OF BEAUTY AND DELIGHT   IT IS NOT IN YOUR POWER TO CAUSE THE GROWTH OF THE TREES IN THEM   CAN THERE BE ANOTHER  GOD BESIDES GOD   NAY  THEY ARE A PEOPLE WHO SWERVE FROM JUSTICE 
   OR  WHO HAS MADE THE EARTH FIRM TO LIVE IN   MADE RIVERS IN ITS MIDST   SET THEREON MOUNTAINS IMMOVABLE   AND MADE A SEPARATING BAR BETWEEN THE TWO BODIES OF FLOWING WATER    CAN THERE BE ANOTHER  GOD BESIDES GOD   NAY  MOST OF THEM KNOW NOT 
   OR  WHO LISTENS TO THE  SOUL  DISTRESSED WHEN IT CALLS ON HIM  AND WHO RELIEVES ITS SUFFERING  AND MAKES YOU  MANKIND  INHERITORS OF THE EARTH    CAN THERE BE ANOTHER  GOD BESIDES GOD   LITTLE IT IS THAT YE HEED  
   OR  WHO GUIDES YOU THROUGH THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS ON LAND AND SEA  AND WHO SENDS THE WINDS AS HERALDS OF GLAD TIDINGS  GOING BEFORE HIS MERCY    CAN THERE BE ANOTHER  GOD BESIDES GOD    HIGH IS GOD ABOVE WHAT THEY ASSOCIATE WITH HIM  
   OR  WHO ORIGINATES CREATION  THEN REPEATS IT  AND WHO GIVES YOU SUSTENANCE FROM HEAVEN AND EARTH    CAN THERE BE ANOTHER  GOD BESIDES GOD   SAY    BRING FORTH YOUR ARGUMENT  IF YE ARE TELLING THE TRUTH    
   SAY   NONE IN THE HEAVENS OR ON EARTH  EXCEPT GOD  KNOWS WHAT IS HIDDEN   NOR CAN THEY PERCEIVE WHEN THEY SHALL BE RAISED UP  FOR JUDGMENT  
   STILL LESS CAN THEIR KNOWLEDGE COMPREHEND THE HEREAFTER   NAY THEY ARE IN DOUBT AND UNCERTAINTY THEREANENT   NAY  THEY ARE BLIND THEREUNTO  SECTION  
   THE UNBELIEVERS SAY     WHAT   WHEN WE BECOME DUST   WE AND OUR FATHERS  SHALL WE REALLY BE RAISED  FROM THE DEAD   
     IT IS TRUE WE WERE PROMISED THIS  WE AND OUR FATHERS BEFORE  US    THESE ARE NOTHING BUT TALES OF THE ANCIENTS  
   SAY     GO YE THROUGH THE EARTH AND SEE WHAT HAS BEEN THE END OF THOSE GUILTY  OF SIN   
   BUT GRIEVE NOT OVER THEM  NOR DISTRESS THYSELF BECAUSE OF THEIR PLOTS 
   THEY ALSO SAY     WHEN WILL THIS PROMISE  COME TO PASS     SAY  IF YE ARE TRUTHFUL  
   SAY     IT MAY BE THAT SOME OF THE EVENTS WHICH YE WISH TO HASTEN ON MAY BE  CLOSE  IN YOUR PURSUIT    
   BUT VERILY THY LORD IS FULL OF GRACE TO MANKIND   YET MOST OF THEM ARE UNGRATEFUL 
   AND VERILY THY LORD KNOWETH ALL THAT THEIR HEARTS DO HIDE  AS WELL AS ALL THAT THEY REVEAL 
   NOR IS THERE AUGHT OF THE UNSEEN  IN HEAVEN OR EARTH  BUT IS  RECORDED  IN A CLEAR RECORD 
   VERILY THIS QUR ĀN DOTH EXPLAIN TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL MOST OF THE MATTERS IN WHICH THEY DISAGREE 
   AND IT CERTAINLY IS A GUIDE AND A MERCY TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE 
   VERILY THY LORD WILL DECIDE BETWEEN THEM BY HIS DECREE   AND HE IS EXALTED IN MIGHT  ALL KNOWING 
   SO PUT THY TRUST IN GOD   FOR THOU ART ON  THE PATH OF  MANIFEST TRUTH 
   TRULY THOU CANST NOT CAUSE THE DEAD TO LISTEN  NOR CANST THOU CAUSE THE DEAF TO HEAR THE CALL   ESPECIALLY  WHEN THEY TURN BACK IN RETREAT 
   NOR CANST THOU BE A GUIDE TO THE BLIND   TO PREVENT THEM  FROM STRAYING   ONLY THOSE WILT THOU GET TO LISTEN WHO BELIEVE IN OUR SIGNS  AND THEY WILL BOW IN ISLAM 
   AND WHEN THE WORD IS FULFILLED AGAINST THEM  THE UNJUST   WE SHALL PRODUCE FROM THE EARTH A BEAST TO  FACE  THEM   HE WILL SPEAK TO THEM  FOR THAT MANKIND DID NOT BELIEVE WITH ASSURANCE IN OUR SIGNS SECTION  
   ONE DAY WE SHALL GATHER TOGETHER FROM EVERY PEOPLE A TROOP OF THOSE WHO REJECT OUR SIGNS  AND THEY SHALL BE KEPT IN RANKS  
   UNTIL  WHEN THEY COME  BEFORE THE JUDGMENT SEAT    GOD  WILL SAY     DID YE REJECT MY SIGNS  THOUGH YE COMPREHENDED THEM NOT IN KNOWLEDGE  OR WHAT WAS IT YE DID    
   AND THE WORD WILL BE FULFILLED AGAINST THEM  BECAUSE OF THEIR WRONG DOING  AND THEY WILL BE UNABLE TO SPEAK  IN PLEA  
   SEE THEY NOT THAT WE HAVE MADE THE NIGHT FOR THEM TO REST IN AND THE DAY TO GIVE THEM LIGHT   VERILY IN THIS ARE SIGNS FOR ANY PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE  
   AND THE DAY THAT THE TRUMPET WILL BE SOUNDED THEN WILL BE SMITTEN WITH TERROR THOSE WHO ARE IN THE HEAVENS  AND THOSE WHO ARE ON EARTH  EXCEPT SUCH AS GOD WILL PLEASE  TO EXEMPT    AND ALL SHALL COME TO HIS  PRESENCE  AS BEINGS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR LOWLINESS 
   THOU SEEST THE MOUNTAINS AND THINKEST THEM FIRMLY FIXED   BUT THEY SHALL PASS AWAY AS THE CLOUDS PASS AWAY    SUCH IS  THE ARTISTRY OF GOD  WHO DISPOSES OF ALL THINGS IN PERFECT ORDER   FOR HE IS WELLACQUAINTED WITH ALL THAT YE DO 
   IF ANY DO GOOD  GOOD WILL  ACCRUE  TO THEM THEREFROM   AND THEY WILL BE SECURE FROM TERROR THAT DAY 
   AND IF ANY DO EVIL  THEIR FACES WILL BE THROWN HEADLONG INTO THE FIRE     DO YE RECEIVE A REWARD OTHER THAN THAT WHICH YE HAVE EARNED BY YOUR DEEDS    
   FOR ME  I HAVE BEEN COMMANDED TO SERVE THE LORD OF THIS CITY  HIM WHO HAS SANCTIFIED IT AND TO WHOM  BELONG  ALL THINGS   AND I AM COMMANDED TO BE OF THOSE WHO BOW IN ISLAM TO GOD S WILL  
   AND TO REHEARSE THE QUR ĀN   AND IF ANY ACCEPT GUIDANCE  THEY DO IT FOR THE GOOD OF THEIR OWN SOULS  AND IF ANY STRAY  SAY     I AM ONLY A WARNER   
   AND SAY     PRAISE BE TO GOD  WHO WILL SOON SHOW YOU HIS SIGNS  SO THAT YE SHALL KNOW THEM     AND THY LORD IS NOT UNMINDFUL OF ALL THAT YE DO 
   TĀ  SĪN  MĪM 
   THESE ARE VERSES OF THE BOOK THAT MAKES  THINGS  CLEAR 
   WE REHEARSE TO THEE SOME OF THE STORY OF MOSES AND PHARAOH IN TRUTH  FOR PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE 
   TRULY PHARAOH ELATED HIMSELF IN THE LAND AND BROKE UP ITS PEOPLE INTO SECTIONS  DEPRESSING A SMALL GROUP AMONG THEM   THEIR SONS HE SLEW  BUT HE KEPT ALIVE THEIR FEMALES   FOR HE WAS INDEED A MAKER OF MISCHIEF 
   AND WE WISHED TO BE GRACIOUS TO THOSE WHO WERE BEING DEPRESSED IN THE LAND  TO MAKE THEM LEADERS  IN FAITH  AND MAKE THEM HEIRS 
   TO ESTABLISH A FIRM PLACE FOR THEM IN THE LAND  AND TO SHOW PHARAOH  HĀMĀN  AND THEIR HOSTS  AT THEIR HANDS  THE VERY THINGS AGAINST WHICH THEY WERE TAKING PRECAUTIONS 
   SO WE SENT THIS INSPIRATION TO THE MOTHER OF MOSES     SUCKLE  THY CHILD   BUT WHEN THOU HAST FEARS ABOUT HIM  CAST HIM INTO THE RIVER  BUT FEAR NOT NOR GRIEVE   FOR WE SHALL RESTORE HIM TO THEE  AND WE SHALL MAKE HIM ONE OF OUR APOSTLES  
   THEN THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH PICKED HIM UP  FROM THE RIVER     IT WAS INTENDED  THAT  MOSES  SHOULD BE TO THEM AN ADVERSARY AND A CAUSE OF SORROW   FOR PHARAOH AND HĀMĀN AND  ALL  THEIR HOSTS WERE MEN OF SIN 
   THE WIFE OF PHARAOH SAID      HERE IS  A JOY OF THE EYE  FOR ME AND FOR THEE   SLAY HIM NOT  IT MAY BE THAT HE WILL BE OF USE TO US  OR WE MAY ADOPT HIM AS A SON   AND THEY PERCEIVED NOT  WHAT THEY WERE DOING   
   BUT THERE CAME TO BE A VOID IN THE HEART OF THE MOTHER OF MOSES   SHE WAS GOING ALMOST TO DISCLOSE HIS  CASE   HAD WE NOT STRENGTHENED HER HEART  WITH FAITH   SO THAT SHE MIGHT REMAIN A  FIRM  BELIEVER 
   AND SHE SAID TO THE SISTER OF  MOSES     FOLLOW HIM    SO SHE  THE SISTER  WATCHED HIM IN THE CHARACTER OF A STRANGER  AND THEY KNEW NOT 
   AND WE ORDAINED THAT HE REFUSED SUCK AT FIRST  UNTIL  HIS SISTER CAME UP AND  SAID     SHALL I POINT OUT TO YOU THE PEOPLE OF A HOUSE THAT WILL NOURISH AND BRING HIM UP FOR YOU AND BE SINCERELY ATTACHED TO HIM     
   THUS DID WE RESTORE HIM TO HIS MOTHER  THAT HER EYE MIGHT BE COMFORTED  THAT SHE MIGHT NOT GRIEVE  AND THAT SHE MIGHT KNOW THAT THE PROMISE OF GOD IS TRUE   BUT MOST OF THEM DO NOT UNDERSTAND SECTION  
   WHEN HE REACHED FULL AGE  AND WAS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED  IN LIFE   WE BESTOWED ON HIM WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE   FOR THUS DO WE REWARD THOSE WHO DO GOOD 
   AND HE ENTERED THE CITY AT A TIME WHEN ITS PEOPLE WERE NOT WATCHING   AND HE FOUND THERE TWO MEN FIGHTING   ONE OF HIS OWN RELIGION  AND THE OTHER  OF HIS FOES  NOW THE MAN OF HIS OWN RELIGION APPEALED TO HIM AGAINST HIS FOE  AND MOSES STRUCK HIM WITH HIS FIST AND MADE AN END OF HIM  HE SAID     THIS IS A WORK OF EVIL  SATAN    FOR HE IS AN ENEMY THAT MANIFESTLY MISLEADS    
   HE PRAYED     O MY LORD   I HAVE INDEED WRONGED MY SOUL   DO THOU THEN FORGIVE ME     SO  GOD  FORGAVE HIM   FOR HE IS THE OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   HE SAID     O MY LORD   FOR THAT THOU HAST BESTOWED THY GRACE ON ME  NEVER SHALL I BE A HELP TO THOSE WHO SIN    
   SO HE SAW THE MORNING IN THE CITY  LOOKING ABOUT  IN A STATE OF FEAR  WHEN BEHOLD  THE MAN WHO HAD  THE DAY BEFORE  SOUGHT HIS HELP CALLED ALOUD FOR HIS HELP  AGAIN   MOSES SAID TO HIM     THOU ART TRULY  IT IS CLEAR  A QUARRELSOME FELLOW    
   THEN  WHEN HE DECIDED TO LAY HOLD OF THE MAN WHO WAS AN ENEMY TO BOTH OF THEM  THAT MAN SAID     O MOSES   IS IT THY INTENTION TO SLAY ME AS THOU SLEWEST A MAN YESTERDAY   THY INTENTION IS NONE OTHER THAN TO BECOME A POWERFUL VIOLENT MAN IN THE LAND  AND NOT TO BE ONE WHO SETS THINGS RIGHT    
   AND THERE CAME A MAN  RUNNING  FROM THE FURTHEST END OF THE CITY  HE SAID     O MOSES   THE CHIEFS ARE TAKING COUNSEL TOGETHER ABOUT THEE  TO SLAY THEE   SO GET THEE AWAY  FOR I DO GIVE THEE SINCERE ADVICE  
   HE THEREFORE GOT AWAY THEREFROM  LOOKING ABOUT  IN A STATE OF FEAR  HE PRAYED     O MY LORD   SAVE ME FROM PEOPLE GIVEN TO WRONG DOING  SECTION  
   THEN  WHEN HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS  THE LAND OF  MADYAN  HE SAID     I DO HOPE THAT MY LORD WILL SHOW ME THE SMOOTH AND STRAIGHT PATH  
   AND WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE WATERING  PLACE  IN MADYAN  HE FOUND THERE A GROUP OF MEN WATERING  THEIR FLOCKS   AND BESIDES THEM HE FOUND TWO WOMEN WHO WERE KEEPING BACK  THEIR FLOCKS   HE SAID     WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU     THEY SAID     WE CANNOT WATER  OUR FLOCKS  UNTIL THE SHEPHERDS TAKE BACK  THEIR FLOCKS    AND OUR FATHER IS A VERY OLD MAN  
   SO HE WATERED  THEIR FLOCKS  FOR THEM   THEN HE TURNED BACK TO THE SHADE  AND SAID     O MY LORD   TRULY AM I IN  DESPERATE  NEED OF ANY GOOD THAT THOU DOST SEND ME     
   AFTERWARDS ONE OF THE  DAMSELS  CAME  BACK  TO HIM  WALKING BASHFULLY  SHE SAID     MY FATHER INVITES THEE THAT HE MAY REWARD THEE FOR HAVING WATERED  OUR FLOCKS  FOR US   SO WHEN HE CAME TO HIM AND NARRATED THE STORY  HE SAID     FEAR THOU NOT    WELL  HAST THOU ESCAPED FROM UNJUST PEOPLE  
   SAID ONE OF THE  DAMSELS      O MY  DEAR  FATHER   ENGAGE HIM ON WAGES   TRULY THE BEST OF MEN FOR THEE TO EMPLOY IS THE  MAN  WHO IS STRONG AND TRUSTY   
   HE SAID     I INTENDED TO WED ONE OF THESE MY DAUGHTERS TO THEE  ON CONDITION THAT THOU SERVE ME FOR EIGHT YEARS   BUT IF THOU COMPLETE TEN YEARS  IT WILL BE  GRACE  FROM THEE  BUT I INTEND NOT TO PLACE THEE UNDER A DIFFICULTY   THOU WILT FIND ME  INDEED  IF GOD WILLS  ONE OF THE RIGHTEOUS  
   HE SAID     BE THAT  THE AGREEMENT  BETWEEN ME AND THEE   WHICHEVER OF THE TWO TERMS I FULFIL  LET THERE BE NO ILL WILL TO ME  BE GOD A WITNESS TO WHAT WE  SECTION  
   NOW WHEN MOSES HAD FULFILLED THE TERM  AND WAS TRAVELLING WITH HIS FAMILY  HE PERCEIVED A FIRE IN THE DIRECTION OF MOUNT ṬŪR  HE SAID TO HIS FAMILY     TARRY YE   I PERCEIVE A FIRE   I HOPE TO BRING YOU FROM THERE SOME INFORMATION  OR A BURNING FIREBRAND  THAT YE MAY WARM YOURSELVES  
   BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE  FIRE   A VOICE WAS HEARD FROM THE RIGHT BANK OF THE VALLEY  FROM A TREE IN HALLOWED GROUND     O MOSES   VERILY I AM GOD  THE LORD OF THE WORLDS 
     NOW DO THOU THROW THY ROD     BUT WHEN HE SAW IT MOVING  OF ITS OWN ACCORD  AS IF IT HAD BEEN A SNAKE  HE TURNED BACK IN RETREAT  AND RETRACED NOT HIS STEPS     O MOSES      IT WAS SAID     DRAW NEAR  AND FEAR NOT   FOR THOU ART OF THOSE WHO ARE SECURE 
     MOVE THY HAND INTO THY BOSOM  AND IT WILL COME FORTH WHITE WITHOUT STAIN  OR HARM   AND DRAW THY HAND CLOSE TO THY SIDE  TO GUARD  AGAINST FEAR  THOSE ARE THE TWO CREDENTIALS FROM THY LORD TO PHARAOH AND HIS CHIEFS   FOR TRULY THEY ARE A PEOPLE REBELLIOUS AND WICKED  
   HE SAID     O MY LORD   I HAVE SLAIN A MAN AMONG THEM  AND I FEAR LEST THEY SLAY ME 
     AND MY BROTHER AARON  HE IS MORE ELOQUENT IN SPEECH THAN I   SO SEND HIM WITH ME AS A HELPER  TO CONFIRM  AND STRENGTHEN  ME   FOR I FEAR THAT THEY MAY ACCUSE ME OF FALSEHOOD  
   HE SAID     WE WILL CERTAINLY STRENGTHEN THY ARM THROUGH THY BROTHER  AND INVEST YOU BOTH WITH AUTHORITY  SO THEY SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO TOUCH YOU   WITH OUR SIGNS SHALL YE TRIUMPH  YOU TWO AS WELL AS THOSE WHO FOLLOW YOU  
   WHEN MOSES CAME TO THEM WITH OUR CLEAR SIGNS  THEY SAID     THIS IS NOTHING BUT SORCERY FAKED UP   NEVER DID WE HEAR THE LIKE AMONG OUR FATHERS OF OLD    
   MOSES SAID     MY LORD KNOWS BEST WHO IT IS THAT COMES WITH GUIDANCE FROM HIM AND WHOSE END WILL BE BEST IN THE HEREAFTER   CERTAIN IT IS THAT THE WRONG DOERS WILL NOT PROSPER  
   PHARAOH SAID     O CHIEFS   NO GOD DO I KNOW FOR YOU BUT MYSELF   THEREFORE  O HĀMĀN   LIGHT ME A  KILN TO BAKE BRICKS  OUT OF CLAY  AND BUILD ME A LOFTY PALACE  THAT I MAY MOUNT UP TO THE GOD OF MOSES   BUT AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED  I THINK  MOSES  IS A LIAR    
   AND HE WAS ARROGANT AND INSOLENT IN THE LAND  BEYOND REASON   HE AND HIS HOSTS   THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO RETURN TO US  
   SO WE SEIZED HIM AND HIS HOSTS  AND WE FLUNG THEM INTO THE SEA   NOW BEHOLD WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE WHO DID WRONG  
   AND WE MADE THEM  BUT  LEADERS INVITING TO THE FIRE   AND ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT NO HELP SHALL THEY FIND 
   IN THIS WORLD WE MADE A CURSE TO FOLLOW THEM   AND ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT THEY WILL BE AMONG THE LOATHED  AND DESPISED  SECTION  
   WE DID REVEAL TO MOSES THE BOOK AFTER WE HAD DESTROYED THE EARLIER GENERATIONS   TO GIVE  INSIGHT TO MEN  AND GUIDANCE AND MERCY  THAT THEY MIGHT RECEIVE ADMONITION 
   THOU WAST NOT ON THE WESTERN SIDE WHEN WE DECREED THE COMMISSION TO MOSES  NOR WAST THOU A WITNESS  OF THOSE EVENTS  
   BUT WE RAISED UP  NEW  GENERATIONS  AND LONG WERE THE AGES THAT PASSED OVER THEM   BUT THOU WAST NOT A DWELLER AMONG THE PEOPLE OF MADYAN  REHEARSING OUR SIGNS TO THEM   BUT IT IS WE WHO SEND APOSTLES  WITH INSPIRATION  
   NOR WAST THOU AT THE SIDE OF  THE MOUNTAIN OF  ṬŪR WHEN WE CALLED  TO MOSES   YET  ART THOU SENT  AS A MERCY FROM THY LORD  TO GIVE WARNING TO A PEOPLE TO WHOM NO WARNER HAD COME BEFORE THEE   IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY RECEIVE ADMONITION 
   IF  WE HAD  NOT  SENT THEE TO THE QURAISH   IN CASE A CALAMITY SHOULD SEIZE THEM FOR  THE DEEDS  THAT THEIR HANDS HAVE SENT FORTH  THEY MIGHT SAY     OUR LORD   WHY DIDST THOU NOT SEND US AN APOSTLE   WE SHOULD THEN HAVE FOLLOWED THY SIGNS AND BEEN AMONGST THOSE WHO BELIEVE    
   BUT  NOW   WHEN THE TRUTH HAS COME TO THEM FROM OURSELVES  THEY SAY    WHY ARE NOT  SIGNS  SENT TO HIM  LIKE THOSE WHICH WERE SENT TO MOSES     DO THEY NOT THEN REJECT  THE SIGNS  WHICH WERE FORMERLY SENT TO MOSES   THEY SAY     TWO KINDS OF SORCERY  EACH ASSISTING THE OTHER     AND THEY SAY     FOR US  WE REJECT ALL  SUCH THINGS     
   SAY     THEN BRING YE A BOOK FROM GOD  WHICH IS A BETTER GUIDE THAN EITHER OF THEM  THAT I MAY FOLLOW IT    DO   IF YE ARE TRUTHFUL    
   BUT IF THEY HEARKEN NOT TO THEE  KNOW THAT THEY ONLY FOLLOW THEIR OWN LUSTS   AND WHO IS MORE ASTRAY THAN ONE WHO FOLLOWS HIS OWN LUSTS  DEVOID OF GUIDANCE FROM GOD   FOR GOD GUIDES NOT PEOPLE GIVEN TO WRONG DOING SECTION  
   NOW HAVE WE CAUSED THE WORD TO REACH THEM THEMSELVES  IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY RECEIVE ADMONITION 
   THOSE TO WHOM WE SENT THE BOOK BEFORE THIS  THEY DO BELIEVE IN THIS  REVELATION   
   AND WHEN IT IS RECITED TO THEM  THEY SAY     WE BELIEVE THEREIN  FOR IT IS THE TRUTH FROM OUR LORD   INDEED WE HAVE BEEN MUSLIMS  BOWING TO GOD S WILL  FROM BEFORE THIS  
   TWICE WILL THEY BE GIVEN THEIR REWARD  FOR THAT THEY HAVE PERSEVERED  THAT THEY AVERT EVIL WITH GOOD  AND THAT THEY SPEND  IN CHARITY  OUT OF WHAT WE HAVE GIVEN THEM 
   AND WHEN THEY HEAR VAIN TALK  THEY TURN AWAY THEREFROM AND SAY     TO US OUR DEEDS  AND TO YOU YOURS   PEACE BE TO YOU   WE SEEK NOT THE IGNORANT  
   IT IS TRUE THOU WILT NOT BE ABLE TO GUIDE EVERY ONE WHOM THOU LOVEST   BUT GOD GUIDES THOSE WHOM HE WILL  AND HE KNOWS BEST THOSE WHO RECEIVE GUIDANCE 
   THEY SAY     IF WE WERE TO FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE WITH THEE  WE SHOULD BE SNATCHED AWAY FROM OUR LAND   HAVE WE NOT ESTABLISHED FOR THEM A SECURE SANCTUARY  TO WHICH ARE BROUGHT AS TRIBUTE FRUITS OF ALL KINDS   A PROVISION FROM OURSELVES   BUT MOST OF THEM UNDERSTAND NOT 
   AND HOW MANY POPULATIONS WE DESTROYED  WHICH EXULTED IN THEIR LIFE  OF EASE AND PLENTY    NOW THOSE HABITATIONS OF THEIRS  AFTER THEM  ARE DESERTED   ALL BUT A  MISERABLE  FEW   AND WE ARE THEIR HEIRS  
   NOR WAS THY LORD THE ONE TO DESTROY A POPULATION UNTIL HE HAD SENT TO ITS CENTER AN APOSTLE  REHEARSING TO THEM OUR SIGNS   NOR ARE WE GOING TO DESTROY A POPULATION EXCEPT WHEN ITS MEMBERS PRACTICE INIQUITY 
   THE  MATERIAL  THINGS WHICH YE ARE GIVEN ARE BUT THE CONVENIENCES OF THIS LIFE AND THE GLITTER THEREOF   BUT THAT WHICH IS WITH GOD IS BETTER AND MORE ENDURING   WILL YE NOT THEN BE WISE  SECTION  
   ARE  THESE TWO  ALIKE    ONE TO WHOM WE HAVE MADE A GOODLY PROMISE  AND WHO IS GOING TO REACH ITS  FULFILMENT   AND ONE TO WHOM WE HAVE GIVEN THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS LIFE  BUT WHO  ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  IS TO BE AMONG THOSE BROUGHT UP  FOR PUNISHMENT   
   THAT DAY  GOD  WILL CALL TO THEM  AND SAY     WHERE ARE MY   PARTNERS      WHOM YE IMAGINED  TO BE SUCH     
   THOSE AGAINST WHOM THE CHARGE WILL BE PROVED  WILL SAY     OUR LORD   THESE ARE THE ONES WHOM WE LED ASTRAY   WE LED THEM ASTRAY  AS WE WERE ASTRAY OURSELVES   WE FREE OURSELVES  FROM THEM  IN THY PRESENCE   IT WAS NOT US THEY WORSHIPPED  
   IT WILL BE SAID  TO THEM      CALL UPON YOUR   PARTNERS    FOR HELP      THEY WILL CALL UPON THEM  BUT THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO THEM   AND THEY WILL SEE THE PENALTY  BEFORE THEM     HOW THEY WILL WISH    IF ONLY THEY HAD BEEN OPEN TO GUIDANCE    
   THAT DAY  GOD  WILL CALL TO THEM  AND SAY     WHAT WAS THE ANSWER YE GAVE TO THE APOSTLES    
   THEN THE  WHOLE  STORY THAT DAY WILL SEEM OBSCURE TO THEM  LIKE LIGHT TO THE BLIND  AND THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE  EVEN  TO QUESTION EACH OTHER 
   BUT ANY THAT  IN THIS LIFE  HAD REPENTED  BELIEVED  AND WORKED RIGHTEOUSNESS  WILL HAVE HOPES TO BE AMONG THOSE WHO ACHIEVE SALVATION 
   THY LORD DOES CREATE AND CHOOSE AS HE PLEASES   NO CHOICE HAVE THEY  IN THE MATTER    GLORY TO GOD   AND FAR IS HE ABOVE THE PARTNERS THEY ASCRIBE  TO HIM   
   AND THY LORD KNOWS ALL THAT THEIR HEARTS CONCEAL AND ALL THAT THEY REVEAL 
   AND HE IS GOD   THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE  TO HIM BE PRAISE  AT THE FIRST AND AT THE LAST   FOR HIM IS THE COMMAND  AND TO HIM SHALL YE  ALL  BE BROUGHT BACK 
   SAY   SEE YE   IF GOD WERE TO MAKE THE NIGHT PERPETUAL OVER YOU TO THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  WHAT GOD IS THERE OTHER THAN GOD  WHO CAN GIVE YOU ENLIGHTENMENT   WILL YE NOT THEN HEARKEN  
   SAY   SEE YE   IF GOD WERE TO MAKE THE DAY PERPETUAL OVER YOU TO THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  WHAT GOD IS THERE OTHER THAN GOD  WHO CAN GIVE YOU A NIGHT IN WHICH YE CAN REST   WILL YE NOT THEN SEE  
   IT IS OUT OF HIS MERCY THAT HE HAS MADE FOR YOU NIGHT AND DAY  THAT YE MAY REST THEREIN  AND THAT YE MAY SEEK OF HIS GRACE    AND IN ORDER THAT YE MAY BE GRATEFUL 
   THE DAY THAT HE WILL CALL ON THEM  HE WILL SAY     WHERE ARE MY   PARTNERS      WHOM YE IMAGINED  TO BE SUCH     
   AND FROM EACH PEOPLE SHALL WE DRAW A WITNESS  AND WE SHALL SAY     PRODUCE YOUR PROOF     THEN SHALL THEY KNOW THAT THE TRUTH IS IN GOD  ALONE   AND THE  LIES  WHICH THEY INVENTED WILL LEAVE THEM IN THE LURCH SECTION  
   QĀRŪN WAS DOUBTLESS  OF THE PEOPLE OF MOSES   BUT HE ACTED INSOLENTLY TOWARDS THEM   SUCH WERE THE TREASURES WE HAD BESTOWED ON HIM  THAT THEIR VERY KEYS WOULD HAVE BEEN A BURDEN TO A BODY OF STRONG MEN  BEHOLD  HIS PEOPLE SAID TO HIM     EXULT NOT  FOR GOD LOVETH NOT THOSE WHO EXULT  IN RICHES  
     BUT SEEK  WITH THE  WEALTH  WHICH GOD HAS BESTOWED ON THEE  THE HOME OF THE HEREAFTER  NOR FORGET THY PORTION IN THIS WORLD   BUT DO THOU GOOD  AS GOD HAS BEEN GOOD TO THEE  AND SEEK NOT  OCCASIONS FOR  MISCHIEF IN THE LAND   FOR GOD LOVES NOT THOSE WHO DO MISCHIEF  
   HE SAID     THIS HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ME BECAUSE OF A CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE WHICH I HAVE   DID HE NOT KNOW THAT GOD HAD DESTROYED  BEFORE HIM   WHOLE  GENERATIONS  WHICH WERE SUPERIOR TO HIM IN STRENGTH AND GREATER IN AMOUNT  OF RICHES  THEY HAD COLLECTED   BUT THE WICKED ARE NOT CALLED  IMMEDIATELY  TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR SINS 
   SO HE WENT FORTH AMONG HIS PEOPLE IN THE  PRIDE OF HIS WORLDLY  GLITTER  SAID THOSE WHOSE AIM IS THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD     OH   THAT WE HAD THE LIKE OF WHAT QĀRŪN HAS GOT   FOR HE IS TRULY A LORD OF MIGHTY GOOD FORTUNE    
   BUT THOSE WHO HAD BEEN GRANTED  TRUE  KNOWLEDGE SAID     ALAS FOR YOU   THE REWARD OF GOD  IN THE HEREAFTER  IS BEST FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS   BUT THIS NONE SHALL ATTAIN  SAVE THOSE WHO STEADFASTLY PERSEVERE  IN GOOD   
   THEN WE CAUSED THE EARTH TO SWALLOW UP HIM AND HIS HOUSE   AND HE HAD NOT  THE LEAST LITTLE  PARTY TO HELP HIM AGAINST GOD  NOR COULD HE DEFEND HIMSELF 
   AND THOSE WHO HAD ENVIED HIS POSITION THE DAY BEFORE BEGAN TO SAY ON THE MORROW     AH   IT IS INDEED GOD WHO ENLARGES THE PROVISION OR RESTRICTS IT  TO ANY OF HIS SERVANTS HE PLEASES   HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT GOD WAS GRACIOUS TO US  HE COULD HAVE CAUSED THE EARTH TO SWALLOW US UP   AH   THOSE WHO REJECT GOD WILL ASSUREDLY NEVER PROSPER  SECTION  
   THAT HOME OF THE HEREAFTER WE SHALL GIVE TO THOSE WHO INTEND NOT HIGH HANDEDNESS OR MISCHIEF ON EARTH   AND THE END IS  BEST  FOR THE RIGHTEOUS 
   IF ANY DOES GOOD  THE REWARD TO HIM IS BETTER THAN HIS DEED   BUT IF ANY DOES EVIL  THE DOERS OF EVIL ARE ONLY PUNISHED  TO THE EXTENT  OF THEIR DEEDS 
   VERILY HE WHO ORDAINED THE QUR ĀN FOR THEE  WILL BRING THEE BACK TO THE PLACE OF RETURN  SAY     MY LORD KNOWS BEST WHO IT IS THAT BRINGS TRUE GUIDANCE  AND WHO IS IN MANIFEST ERROR  
   AND THOU HADST NOT EXPECTED THAT THE BOOK WOULD BE SENT TO THEE EXCEPT AS A MERCY FROM THY LORD   THEREFORE LEND NOT THOU SUPPORT IN ANY WAY TO THOSE WHO REJECT  GOD S MESSAGE  
   AND LET NOTHING KEEP THEE BACK FROM THE SIGNS OF GOD AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN REVEALED TO THEE   AND INVITE  MEN  TO THY LORD  AND BE NOT OF THE COMPANY OF THOSE WHO JOIN GODS WITH GOD 
   AND CALL NOT  BESIDES GOD  ON ANOTHER GOD  THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE  EVERYTHING  THAT EXISTS  WILL PERISH EXCEPT HIS OWN FACE  TO HIM BELONGS THE COMMAND  AND TO HIM WILL YE  ALL  BE BROUGHT BACK 
   ALIF LAM MIM 
   DO MEN THINK THAT THEY WILL BE LEFT ALONE ON SAYING    WE BELIEVE    AND THAT THEY WILL NOT BE TESTED  
   WE DID TEST THOSE BEFORE THEM  AND GOD WILL CERTAINLY KNOW THOSE WHO ARE TRUE FROM THOSE WHO ARE FALSE 
   DO THOSE WHO PRACTICE EVIL THINK THAT THEY WILL GET THE BETTER OF US   EVIL IS THEIR JUDGMENT  
   FOR THOSE WHOSE HOPES ARE IN THE MEETING WITH GOD  IN THE HEREAFTER  LET THEM STRIVE    FOR THE TERM  APPOINTED  BY GOD IS SURELY COMING   AND HE HEARS AND KNOWS  ALL THINGS  
   AND IF ANY STRIVE  WITH MIGHT AND MAIN   THEY DO SO FOR THEIR OWN SOULS   FOR GOD IS FREE OF ALL NEEDS FROM ALL CREATION 
   THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  FROM THEM SHALL WE BLOT OUT ALL EVIL  THAT MAY BE  IN THEM  AND WE SHALL REWARD THEM ACCORDING TO THE BEST OF THEIR DEEDS 
   WE HAVE ENJOINED ON MAN KINDNESS TO PARENTS   BUT IF THEY  EITHER OF THEM  STRIVE  TO FORCE  THEE TO JOIN WITH ME  IN WORSHIP  ANYTHING OF WHICH THOU HAST NO KNOWLEDGE  OBEY THEM NOT  YE HAVE  ALL  TO RETURN TO ME  AND I WILL TELL YOU  THE TRUTH  OF ALL THAT YE DID 
   AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUS DEEDS   THEM SHALL WE ADMIT TO THE COMPANY OF THE RIGHTEOUS 
   THEN THERE ARE AMONG MEN SUCH AS SAY    WE BELIEVE IN GOD     BUT WHEN THEY SUFFER AFFLICTION IN  THE CAUSE OF  GOD  THEY TREAT MEN S OPPRESSION AS IF IT WERE THE WRATH OF GOD   AND IF HELP COMES  TO THEE  FROM THY LORD  THEY ARE SURE TO SAY    WE HAVE  ALWAYS  BEEN WITH YOU     DOES NOT GOD KNOW BEST ALL THAT IS IN THE HEARTS OF ALL CREATION  
   AND GOD MOST CERTAINLY KNOWS THOSE WHO BELIEVE  AND AS CERTAINLY THOSE WHO ARE HYPOCRITES 
   AND THE UNBELIEVERS SAY TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE     FOLLOW OUR PATH  AND WE WILL BEAR  THE CONSEQUENCES  OF YOUR FAULTS   NEVER IN THE LEAST WILL THEY BEAR THEIR FAULTS   IN FACT THEY ARE LIARS  
   THEY WILL BEAR THEIR OWN BURDENS  AND  OTHER  BURDENS ALONG WITH THEIR OWN  AND ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT THEY WILL BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR FALSEHOODS SECTION  
   WE  ONCE  SENT NOAH TO HIS PEOPLE  AND HE TARRIED AMONG THEM A THOUSAND YEARS LESS FIFTY   BUT THE DELUGE OVERWHELMED THEM WHILE THEY  PERSISTED IN  SIN 
   BUT WE SAVED HIM AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE ARK  AND WE MADE THE  ARK  A SIGN FOR ALL PEOPLES  
   AND  WE ALSO SAVED  ABRAHAM   BEHOLD  HE SAID TO HIS PEOPLE    SERVE GOD AND FEAR HIM   THAT WILL BE BEST FOR YOU  IF YE UNDERSTAND  
     FOR YE DO WORSHIP IDOLS BESIDES GOD  AND YE INVENT FALSEHOOD  THE THINGS THAT YE WORSHIP BESIDES GOD HAVE NO POWER TO GIVE YOU SUSTENANCE   THEN SEEK YE SUSTENANCE FROM GOD  SERVE HIM  AND BE GRATEFUL TO HIM   TO HIM WILL BE YOUR RETURN 
     AND IF YE REJECT  THE MESSAGE   SO DID GENERATIONS BEFORE YOU   AND THE DUTY OF THE APOSTLE IS ONLY TO PREACH PUBLICLY  AND CLEARLY   
   SEE THEY NOT HOW GOD ORIGINATES CREATION  THEN REPEATS IT   TRULY THAT IS EASY FOR GOD 
   SAY     TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH AND SEE HOW GOD DID ORIGINATE CREATION   SO WILL GOD PRODUCE A LATER CREATION   FOR GOD HAS POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
     HE PUNISHES WHOM HE PLEASES  AND HE GRANTS MERCY TO WHOM HE PLEASES  AND TOWARDS HIM ARE YE TURNED 
     NOT ON EARTH NOR IN HEAVEN WILL YE BE ABLE  FLEEING  TO FRUSTRATE  HIS PLAN   NOR HAVE YE  BESIDES GOD  ANY PROTECTOR OR HELPER  SECTION  
   SO NAUGHT WAS THE ANSWER OF  ABRAHAM S  PEOPLE EXCEPT THAT THEY SAID     SLAY HIM OR BURN HIM   BUT GOD DID SAVE HIM FROM THE FIRE  VERILY IN THIS ARE SIGNS FOR PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE 
   AND HE SAID     FOR YOU  YE HAVE TAKEN  FOR WORSHIP  IDOLS BESIDES GOD  OUT OF MUTUAL LOVE AND REGARD BETWEEN YOURSELVES IN THIS LIFE   BUT ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT YE SHALL DISOWN EACH OTHER AND CURSE EACH OTHER   AND YOUR ABODE WILL BE THE FIRE  AND YE SHALL HAVE NONE TO HELP  
   BUT LŪṬ HAD FAITH IN HIM   HE SAID     I WILL LEAVE HOME FOR THE SAKE OF MY LORD   FOR HE IS EXALTED IN MIGHT  AND WISE  
   AND WE GAVE  ABRAHAM  ISAAC AND JACOB  AND ORDAINED AMONG HIS PROGENY PROPHETHOOD AND REVELATION  AND WE GRANTED HIM HIS REWARD IN THIS LIFE   AND HE WAS IN THE HEREAFTER  OF THE COMPANY  OF THE RIGHTEOUS 
   AND  REMEMBER  LŪṬ   BEHOLD  HE SAID TO HIS PEOPLE     YE DO COMMIT LEWDNESS  SUCH AS NO PEOPLE IN CREATION  EVER  COMMITTED BEFORE YOU 
     DO YE INDEED APPROACH MEN  AND CUT OFF THE HIGHWAY    AND PRACTICE WICKEDNESS  EVEN  IN YOUR COUNCILS     BUT HIS PEOPLE GAVE NO ANSWER BUT THIS   THEY SAID     BRING US THE WRATH OF GOD IF THOU TELLEST THE TRUTH  
   HE SAID     O MY LORD   HELP THOU ME AGAINST PEOPLE WHO DO MISCHIEF    SECTION  
   WHEN OUR MESSENGERS CAME TO ABRAHAM WITH THE GOOD NEWS  THEY SAID     WE ARE INDEED GOING TO DESTROY THE PEOPLE OF THIS TOWNSHIP   FOR TRULY THEY ARE  ADDICTED TO  CRIME  
   HE SAID     BUT THERE IS LŪṬ THERE   THEY SAID     WELL DO WE KNOW WHO IS THERE   WE WILL CERTAINLY SAVE HIM AND HIS FOLLOWING   EXCEPT HIS WIFE   SHE IS OF THOSE WHO LAG BEHIND    
   AND WHEN OUR MESSENGERS CAME TO LŪṬ  HE WAS GRIEVED ON THEIR ACCOUNT  AND FELT HIMSELF POWERLESS  TO PROTECT  THEM   BUT THEY SAID     FEAR THOU NOT  NOR GRIEVE   WE ARE  HERE  TO SAVE THEE AND THY FOLLOWING  EXCEPT THY WIFE   SHE IS OF THOSE WHO LAG BEHIND 
     FOR WE ARE GOING TO BRING DOWN ON THE PEOPLE OF THIS TOWNSHIP A PUNISHMENT FROM HEAVEN  BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN WICKEDLY REBELLIOUS  
   AND WE HAVE LEFT THEREOF AN EVIDENT SIGN  FOR ANY PEOPLE WHO  CARE TO  UNDERSTAND 
   TO THE MADYAN  PEOPLE   WE SENT  THEIR BROTHER SHU AIB  THEN HE SAID     O MY PEOPLE   SERVE GOD  AND FEAR THE LAST DAY   NOR COMMIT EVIL ON THE EARTH  WITH INTENT TO DO MISCHIEF  
   BUT THEY REJECTED HIM   THEN THE MIGHTY BLAST SEIZED THEM  AND THEY LAY PROSTRATE IN THEIR HOMES BY THE MORNING 
    REMEMBER ALSO  THE  ĀD AND THE THAMŪD  PEOPLE    CLEARLY WILL APPEAR TO YOU FROM  THE TRACES  OF THEIR BUILDINGS  THEIR FATE    THE EVIL ONE MADE THEIR DEEDS ALLURING TO THEM  AND KEPT THEM BACK FROM THE PATH  THOUGH THEY WERE GIFTED WITH INTELLIGENCE AND SKILL 
    REMEMBER ALSO  QĀRŪN  PHARAOH  AND HĀMĀN   THERE CAME TO THEM MOSES WITH CLEAR SIGNS  BUT THEY BEHAVED WITH INSOLENCE ON THE EARTH   YET THEY COULD NOT OVERREACH  US  
   EACH ONE OF THEM WE SEIZED FOR HIS CRIME   OF THEM  AGAINST SOME WE SENT A VIOLENT TORNADO  WITH SHOWERS OF STONES    SOME WERE CAUGHT BY A  MIGHTY  BLAST   SOME WE CAUSED THE EARTH TO SWALLOW UP   AND SOME WE DROWNED  IN THE WATERS    IT WAS NOT GOD WHO INJURED  OR OPPRESSED  THEM   THEY INJURED  AND OPPRESSED  THEIR OWN SOULS 
   THE PARABLE OF THOSE WHO TAKE PROTECTORS OTHER THAN GOD IS THAT OF THE SPIDER  WHO BUILDS  TO ITSELF  A HOUSE   BUT TRULY THE FLIMSIEST OF HOUSES IS THE SPIDER S HOUSE    IF THEY BUT KNEW 
   VERILY GOD DOTH KNOW OF  EVERY THING  WHATEVER THAT THEY CALL UPON BESIDES HIM   AND HE IS EXALTED  IN POWER   WISE 
   AND SUCH ARE THE PARABLES WE SET FORTH FOR MANKIND  BUT ONLY THOSE UNDERSTAND THEM WHO HAVE KNOWLEDGE 
   GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH IN TRUE  PROPORTIONS    VERILY IN THAT IS A SIGN FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE SECTION  
   RECITE WHAT IS SENT OF THE BOOK BY INSPIRATION TO THEE  AND ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER   FOR PRAYER RESTRAINS FROM SHAMEFUL AND UNJUST DEEDS   AND REMEMBRANCE OF GOD IS THE GREATEST  THING IN LIFE  WITHOUT DOUBT  AND GOD KNOWS THE  DEEDS  THAT YE DO 
   AND DISPUTE YE NOT WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK  EXCEPT WITH MEANS BETTER  THAN MERE DISPUTATION   UNLESS IT BE WITH THOSE OF THEM WHO INFLICT WRONG  AND INJURY    BUT SAY    WE BELIEVE IN THE REVELATION WHICH HAS COME DOWN TO US AND IN THAT WHICH CAME DOWN TO YOU   OUR GOD AND YOUR GOD IS ONE   AND IT IS TO HIM WE BOW  IN ISLAM   
   AND THUS  IT IS  THAT WE HAVE SENT DOWN THE BOOK TO THEE  SO THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK BELIEVE THEREIN  AS ALSO DO SOME OF THESE  PAGAN ARABS    AND NONE BUT UNBELIEVERS REJECT OUR SIGNS 
   AND THOU WAST NOT  ABLE  TO RECITE A BOOK BEFORE THIS  BOOK CAME   NOR ART THOU  ABLE  TO TRANSCRIBE IT WITH THY RIGHT HAND   IN THAT CASE  INDEED  WOULD THE TALKERS OF VANITIES HAVE DOUBTED 
   NAY  HERE ARE SIGNS SELF EVIDENT IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE ENDOWED WITH KNOWLEDGE   AND NONE BUT THE UNJUST REJECT OUR SIGNS 
   YET THEY SAY     WHY ARE NOT SIGNS SENT DOWN TO HIM FROM HIS LORD     SAY     THE SIGNS ARE INDEED WITH GOD   AND I AM INDEED A CLEAR WARNER  
   AND IS IT NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM THAT WE HAVE SENT DOWN TO THEE THE BOOK WHICH IS REHEARSED TO THEM   VERILY  IN IT IS MERCY AND A REMINDER TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE SECTION  
   SAY     ENOUGH IS GOD FOR A WITNESS BETWEEN ME AND YOU   HE KNOWS WHAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  AND IT IS THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN VANITIES AND REJECT GOD  THAT WILL PERISH  IN THE END   
   THEY ASK THEE TO HASTEN ON THE PUNISHMENT  FOR THEM    HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR A TERM  OF RESPITE  APPOINTED  THE PUNISHMENT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE COME TO THEM   AND IT WILL CERTAINLY REACH THEM   OF A SUDDEN  WHILE THEY PERCEIVE NOT  
   THEY ASK THEE TO HASTEN ON THE PUNISHMENT   BUT  OF A SURETY  HELL WILL ENCOMPASS THE REJECTERS OF FAITH   
   ON THE DAY THAT THE PUNISHMENT SHALL COVER THEM FROM ABOVE THEM AND FROM BELOW THEM  AND  A VOICE  SHALL SAY     TASTE YE  THE FRUITS  OF YOUR DEEDS    
   O MY SERVANTS WHO BELIEVE   TRULY  SPACIOUS IS MY EARTH   THEREFORE SERVE YE ME   AND ME ALONE   
   EVERY SOUL SHALL HAVE A TASTE OF DEATH   IN THE END TO US SHALL YE BE BROUGHT BACK 
   BUT THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  TO THEM SHALL WE GIVE A HOME IN HEAVEN   LOFTY MANSIONS BENEATH WHICH FLOW RIVERS  TO DWELL THEREIN FOR AYE    AN EXCELLENT REWARD FOR THOSE WHO DO  GOOD   
   THOSE WHO PERSEVERE IN PATIENCE  AND PUT THEIR TRUST IN THEIR LORD AND CHERISHER 
   HOW MANY ARE THE CREATURES THAT CARRY NOT THEIR OWN SUSTENANCE   IT IS GOD WHO FEEDS  BOTH  THEM AND YOU   FOR HE HEARS AND KNOWS  ALL THINGS  
   IF INDEED THOU ASK THEM WHO HAS CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND SUBJECTED THE SUN AND THE MOON  TO HIS LAW   THEY WILL CERTAINLY REPLY    GOD    HOW ARE THEY THEN DELUDED AWAY  FROM THE TRUTH   
   GOD ENLARGES THE SUSTENANCE  WHICH HE GIVES  TO WHICHEVER OF HIS SERVANTS HE PLEASES   AND HE  SIMILARLY  GRANTS BY  STRICT  MEASURE   AS HE PLEASES    FOR GOD HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THINGS 
   AND IF INDEED THOU ASK THEM WHO IT IS THAT SENDS DOWN RAIN FROM THE SKY  AND GIVES LIFE THEREWITH TO THE EARTH AFTER ITS DEATH  THEY WILL CERTAINLY REPLY    GOD     SAY    PRAISE BE TO GOD     BUT MOST OF THEM UNDERSTAND NOT SECTION  
   WHAT IS THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD BUT AMUSEMENT AND PLAY   BUT VERILY THE HOME IN THE HEREAFTER  THAT IS LIFE INDEED  IF THEY BUT KNEW 
   NOW IF THEY EMBARK ON A BOAT  THEY CALL ON GOD  MAKING THEIR DEVOTION SINCERELY  AND EXCLUSIVELY  TO HIM   BUT WHEN HE HAS DELIVERED THEM SAFELY TO  DRY  LAND  BEHOLD  THEY GIVE A SHARE  OF THEIR WORSHIP TO OTHERS    
   DISDAINING UNGRATEFULLY OUR GIFTS  AND GIVING THEMSELVES UP TO  WORLDLY  ENJOYMENT   BUT SOON WILL THEY KNOW 
   DO THEY NOT THEN SEE THAT WE HAVE MADE A SANCTUARY SECURE  AND THAT MEN ARE BEING SNATCHED AWAY FROM ALL AROUND THEM   THEN  DO THEY BELIEVE IN THAT WHICH IS VAIN AND REJECT THE GRACE OF GOD  
   AND WHO DOES MORE WRONG THAN HE WHO INVENTS A LIE AGAINST GOD OR REJECTS THE TRUTH WHEN IT REACHES HIM   IS THERE NOT A HOME IN HELL FOR THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH  
   AND THOSE WHO STRIVE IN OUR  CAUSE   WE WILL CERTAINLY GUIDE THEM TO OUR PATHS   FOR VERILY GOD IS WITH THOSE WHO DO RIGHT 
   A  L  M 
   THE ROMAN EMPIRE HAS BEEN DEFEATED 
   IN A LAND CLOSE BY   BUT THEY   EVEN  AFTER  THIS  DEFEAT OF THEIRS  WILL SOON BE VICTORIOUS 
   WITHIN A FEW YEARS  WITH GOD IS THE DECISION  IN THE PAST AND IN THE FUTURE   ON THAT DAY SHALL THE BELIEVERS REJOICE 
   WITH THE HELP OF GOD  HE HELPS WHOM HE WILL  AND HE IS EXALTED IN MIGHT  MOST MERCIFUL 
    IT IS  THE PROMISE OF GOD  NEVER DOES GOD DEPART FROM HIS PROMISE   BUT MOST MEN UNDERSTAND NOT 
   THEY KNOW BUT THE OUTER  THINGS  IN THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD   BUT OF THE END OF THINGS THEY ARE HEEDLESS 
   DO THEY NOT REFLECT IN THEIR OWN MINDS   NOT BUT FOR JUST ENDS AND FOR A TERM APPOINTED  DID GOD CREATE THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL BETWEEN THEM   YET ARE THERE TRULY MANY AMONG MEN WHO DENY THE MEETING WITH THEIR LORD  AT THE RESURRECTION   
   DO THEY NOT TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH  AND SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE BEFORE THEM   THEY WERE SUPERIOR TO THEM IN STRENGTH   THEY TILLED THE SOIL AND POPULATED IT IN GREATER NUMBERS THAN THESE HAVE DONE   THERE CAME TO THEM THEIR APOSTLES WITH CLEAR  SIGNS    WHICH THEY REJECTED  TO THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION    IT WAS NOT GOD WHO WRONGED THEM  BUT THEY WRONGED THEIR OWN SOULS 
   IN THE LONG RUN EVIL IN THE EXTREME WILL BE THE END OF THOSE WHO DO EVIL   FOR THAT THEY REJECTED THE SIGNS OF GOD  AND HELD THEM UP TO RIDICULE SECTION  
   IT IS GOD WHO BEGINS  THE PROCESS OF  CREATION   THEN REPEATS IT   THEN SHALL YE BE BROUGHT BACK TO HIM 
   ON THE DAY THAT THE HOUR WILL BE ESTABLISHED  THE GUILTY WILL BE STRUCK DUMB WITH DESPAIR 
   NO INTERCESSOR WILL THEY HAVE AMONG THEIR   PARTNERS    AND THEY WILL  THEMSELVES  REJECT THEIR   PARTNERS   
   ON THE DAY THAT THE HOUR WILL BE ESTABLISHED  THAT DAY SHALL  ALL MEN  BE SORTED OUT 
   THEN THOSE WHO HAVE BELIEVED AND WORKED RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  SHALL BE MADE HAPPY IN A MEAD OF DELIGHT 
   AND THOSE WHO HAVE REJECTED FAITH AND FALSELY DENIED OUR SIGNS AND THE MEETING OF THE HEREAFTER  SUCH SHALL BE BROUGHT FORTH TO PUNISHMENT 
   SO  GIVE  GLORY TO GOD  WHEN YE REACH EVENTIDE AND WHEN YE RISE IN THE MORNING  
   YEA  TO HIM BE PRAISE  IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   AND IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND WHEN THE DAY BEGINS TO DECLINE 
   IT IS HE WHO BRINGS OUT THE LIVING FROM THE DEAD  AND BRINGS OUT THE DEAD FROM THE LIVING  AND WHO GIVES LIFE TO THE EARTH AFTER IT IS DEAD   AND THUS SHALL YE BE BROUGHT OUT  FROM THE DEAD  SECTION  
   AMONG HIS SIGNS IS THIS  THAT HE CREATED YOU FROM DUST   AND THEN   BEHOLD  YE ARE MEN SCATTERED  FAR AND WIDE   
   AND AMONG HIS SIGNS IS THIS  THAT HE CREATED FOR YOU MATES FROM AMONG YOURSELVES  THAT YE MAY DWELL IN TRANQUILLITY WITH THEM  AND HE HAS PUT LOVE AND MERCY BETWEEN YOUR  HEARTS    VERILY IN THAT ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE WHO REFLECT 
   AND AMONG HIS SIGNS IS THE CREATION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND THE VARIATIONS IN YOUR LANGUAGES AND YOUR COLOURS   VERILY IN THAT ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE WHO KNOW 
   AND AMONG HIS SIGNS IS THE SLEEP THAT YE TAKE BY NIGHT AND BY DAY  AND THE QUEST THAT YE  MAKE FOR LIVELIHOOD  OUT OF HIS BOUNTY   VERILY IN THAT ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE WHO HEARKEN 
   AND AMONG HIS SIGNS  HE SHOWS YOU THE LIGHTNING  BY WAY BOTH OF FEAR AND OF HOPE  AND HE SENDS DOWN RAIN FROM THE SKY AND WITH IT GIVES LIFE TO THE EARTH AFTER IT IS DEAD   VERILY IN THAT ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE WHO ARE WISE 
   AND AMONG HIS SIGNS IS THIS  THAT HEAVEN AND EARTH STAND BY HIS COMMAND   THEN WHEN HE CALLS YOU  BY A SINGLE CALL  FROM THE EARTH  BEHOLD  YE  STRAIGHTWAY  COME FORTH 
   TO HIM BELONGS EVERY BEING THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   ALL ARE DEVOUTLY OBEDIENT TO HIM 
   IT IS HE WHO BEGINS  THE PROCESS OF  CREATION   THEN REPEATS IT   AND FOR HIM IT IS MOST EASY  TO HIM BELONGS THE LOFTIEST SIMILITUDE  WE CAN THINK OF  IN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   FOR HE IS EXALTED IN MIGHT  FULL OF WISDOM SECTION  
   HE DOES PROPOUND TO YOU A SIMILITUDE FROM YOUR OWN  EXPERIENCE    DO YE HAVE PARTNERS AMONG THOSE WHOM YOUR RIGHT HANDS POSSESS  TO SHARE AS EQUALS IN THE WEALTH WE HAVE BESTOWED ON YOU   DO YE FEAR THEM AS YE FEAR EACH OTHER   THUS DO WE EXPLAIN THE SIGNS IN DETAIL TO A PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND 
   NAY  THE WRONG DOERS  MERELY  FOLLOW THEIR OWN LUSTS  BEING DEVOID OF KNOWLEDGE  BUT WHO WILL GUIDE THOSE WHOM GOD LEAVES ASTRAY   TO THEM THERE WILL BE NO HELPERS 
   SO SET THOU THY FACE STEADILY AND TRULY TO THE FAITH    ESTABLISH  GOD S HANDIWORK ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN ON WHICH HE HAS MADE MANKIND   NO CHANGE  LET THERE BE  IN THE WORK  WROUGHT  BY GOD   THAT IS THE STANDARD RELIGION   BUT MOST AMONG MANKIND UNDERSTAND NOT 
   TURN YE BACK IN REPENTANCE TO HIM  AND FEAR HIM   ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS  AND BE NOT YE AMONG THOSE WHO JOIN GODS WITH GOD  
   THOSE WHO SPLIT UP THEIR RELIGION  AND BECOME  MERE  SECTS  EACH PARTY REJOICING IN THAT WHICH IS WITH ITSELF  
   WHEN TROUBLE TOUCHES MEN  THEY CRY TO THEIR LORD  TURNING BACK TO HIM IN REPENTANCE   BUT WHEN HE GIVES THEM A TASTE OF MERCY AS FROM HIMSELF  BEHOLD  SOME OF THEM PAY PART WORSHIP TO OTHER GODS BESIDES THEIR LORD  
    AS IF  TO SHOW THEIR INGRATITUDE FOR THE  FAVOURS  WE HAVE BESTOWED ON THEM   THEN ENJOY  YOUR BRIEF DAY    BUT SOON WILL YE KNOW  YOUR FOLLY  
   OR HAVE WE SENT DOWN AUTHORITY TO THEM  WHICH POINTS OUT TO THEM THE THINGS TO WHICH THEY PAY PART WORSHIP  
   WHEN WE GIVE MEN A TASTE OF MERCY  THEY EXULT THEREAT   AND WHEN SOME EVIL AFFLICTS THEM BECAUSE OF WHAT THEIR  OWN  HANDS HAVE SENT FORTH  BEHOLD  THEY ARE IN DESPAIR  
   SEE THEY NOT THAT GOD ENLARGES THE PROVISION AND RESTRICTS IT  TO WHOMSOEVER HE PLEASES   VERILY IN THAT ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE 
   SO GIVE WHAT IS DUE TO KINDRED  THE NEEDY  AND THE WAYFARER  THAT IS BEST FOR THOSE WHO SEEK THE COUNTENANCE  OF GOD  AND IT IS THEY WHO WILL PROSPER 
   THAT WHICH YE LAY OUT FOR INCREASE THROUGH THE PROPERTY OF  OTHER  PEOPLE  WILL HAVE NO INCREASE WITH GOD   BUT THAT WHICH YE LAY OUT FOR CHARITY  SEEKING THE COUNTENANCE OF GOD   WILL INCREASE    IT IS THESE WHO WILL GET A RECOMPENSE MULTIPLIED 
   IT IS GOD WHO HAS CREATED YOU   FURTHER  HE HAS PROVIDED FOR YOUR SUSTENANCE   THEN HE WILL CAUSE YOU TO DIE   AND AGAIN HE WILL GIVE YOU LIFE  ARE THERE ANY OF YOUR  FALSE    PARTNERS   WHO CAN DO ANY SINGLE ONE OF THESE THINGS   GLORY TO HIM   AND HIGH IS HE ABOVE THE PARTNERS THEY ATTRIBUTE  TO HIM   SECTION  
   MISCHIEF HAS APPEARED ON LAND AND SEA BECAUSE OF  THE MEED  THAT THE HANDS OF MEN HAVE EARNED  THAT  GOD  MAY GIVE THEM A TASTE OF SOME OF THEIR DEEDS   IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY TURN BACK  FROM EVIL  
   SAY     TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH AND SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE BEFORE  YOU    MOST OF THEM WORSHIPPED OTHERS BESIDES GOD  
   BUT SET THOU THY FACE TO THE RIGHT RELIGION  BEFORE THERE COME FROM GOD THE DAY WHICH THERE IS NO CHANCE OF AVERTING   ON THAT DAY SHALL MEN BE DIVIDED  IN TWO  
   THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH WILL SUFFER FROM THAT REJECTION   AND THOSE WHO WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL SPREAD THEIR COUCH  OF REPOSE  FOR THEMSELVES  IN HEAVEN   
   THAT HE MAY REWARD THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  OUT OF HIS BOUNTY  FOR HE LOVES NOT THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH 
   AMONG HIS SIGNS IS THIS  THAT HE SENDS THE WINDS  AS HERALDS OF GLAD TIDINGS  GIVING YOU A TASTE OF HIS  GRACE AND  MERCY   THAT THE SHIPS MAY SAIL  MAJESTICALLY  BY HIS COMMAND AND THAT YE MAY SEEK OF HIS BOUNTY   IN ORDER THAT YE MAY BE GRATEFUL 
   WE DID INDEED SEND  BEFORE THEE  APOSTLES TO THEIR  RESPECTIVE  PEOPLES  AND THEY CAME TO THEM WITH CLEAR SIGNS   THEN  TO THOSE WHO TRANSGRESSED  WE METED OUT RETRIBUTION   AND IT WAS DUE FROM US TO AID THOSE WHO BELIEVED 
   IT IS GOD WHO SENDS THE WINDS  AND THEY RAISE THE CLOUDS   THEN DOES HE SPREAD THEM IN THE SKY AS HE WILLS  AND BREAK THEM INTO FRAGMENTS  UNTIL THOU SEEST RAIN DROPS ISSUE FROM THE MIDST THEREOF   THEN WHEN HE HAS MADE THEM REACH SUCH OF HIS SERVANTS AS HE WILLS  BEHOLD  THEY DO REJOICE   
   EVEN  THOUGH BEFORE THEY RECEIVED  THE RAIN  JUST BEFORE THIS  THEY WERE DUMB WITH DESPAIR  
   THEN CONTEMPLATE  O MAN    THE MEMORIALS OF GOD S MERCY    HOW HE GIVES LIFE TO THE EARTH AFTER ITS DEATH   VERILY THE SAME WILL GIVE LIFE TO THE MEN WHO ARE DEAD   FOR HE HAS POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   AND IF WE  BUT  SEND A WIND FROM WHICH THEY SEE  THEIR TILTH  TURN YELLOW  BEHOLD  THEY BECOME  THEREAFTER  UNGRATEFUL  UNBELIEVERS   
   SO VERILY THOU CANST NOT MAKE THE DEAD TO HEAR  NOR CANST THOU MAKE THE DEAF TO HEAR THE CALL  WHEN THEY SHOW THEIR BACKS AND TURN AWAY 
   NOR CANST THOU LEAD BACK THE BLIND FROM THEIR STRAYING   ONLY THOSE WILT THOU MAKE TO HEAR  WHO BELIEVE IN OUR SIGNS AND SUBMIT  THEIR WILLS IN ISLAM  SECTION  
   IT IS GOD WHO CREATED YOU IN A STATE OF  HELPLESS  WEAKNESS  THEN GAVE  YOU  STRENGTH AFTER WEAKNESS  THEN  AFTER STRENGTH  GAVE  YOU  WEAKNESS AND A HOARY HEAD   HE CREATES AS HE WILLS  AND IT IS HE WHO HAS ALL KNOWLEDGE AND POWER 
   ON THE DAY THAT THE HOUR  OF RECKONING  WILL BE ESTABLISHED  THE TRANSGRESSORS WILL SWEAR THAT THEY TARRIED NOT BUT AN HOUR   THUS WERE THEY USED TO BEING DELUDED  
   BUT THOSE ENDUED WITH KNOWLEDGE AND FAITH WILL SAY     INDEED YE DID TARRY  WITHIN GOD S DECREE  TO THE DAY OF RESURRECTION  AND THIS IS THE DAY OF RESURRECTION   BUT YE  YE WERE NOT AWARE    
   SO ON THAT DAY NO EXCUSE OF THEIRS WILL AVAIL THE TRANSGRESSORS  NOR WILL THEY BE INVITED  THEN  TO SEEK GRACE  BY REPENTANCE  
   VERILY WE HAVE PROPOUNDED FOR MEN  IN THIS QUR ĀN  EVERY KIND OF PARABLE   BUT IF THOU BRING TO THEM ANY SIGN  THE UNBELIEVERS ARE SURE TO SAY    YE DO NOTHING BUT TALK VANITIES  
   THUS DOES GOD SEAL UP THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND NOT 
   SO PATIENTLY PERSEVERE   FOR VERILY THE PROMISE OF GOD IS TRUE   NOR LET THOSE SHAKE THY FIRMNESS  WHO HAVE  THEMSELVES  NO CERTAINTY OF FAITH 
   A  L  M 
   THESE ARE VERSES OF THE WISE BOOK  
   A GUIDE AND A MERCY TO THE DOERS OF GOOD  
   THOSE WHO ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER  AND GIVE REGULAR CHARITY  AND HAVE  IN THEIR HEARTS  THE ASSURANCE OF THE HEREAFTER 
   THESE ARE ON  TRUE  GUIDANCE FROM THEIR LORD   AND THESE ARE THE ONES WHO WILL PROSPER 
   BUT THERE ARE  AMONG MEN  THOSE WHO PURCHASE IDLE TALES  WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE  OR MEANING   TO MISLEAD  MEN  FROM THE PATH OF GOD AND THROW RIDICULE  ON THE PATH    FOR SUCH THERE WILL BE A HUMILIATING PENALTY 
   WHEN OUR SIGNS ARE REHEARSED TO SUCH A ONE  HE TURNS AWAY IN ARROGANCE  AS IF HE HEARD THEM NOT  AS IF THERE WERE DEAFNESS IN BOTH HIS EARS   ANNOUNCE TO HIM A GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  THERE WILL BE GARDENS OF BLISS  
   TO DWELL THEREIN  THE PROMISE OF GOD IS TRUE   AND HE IS EXALTED IN POWER  WISE 
   HE CREATED THE HEAVENS WITHOUT ANY PILLARS THAT YE CAN SEE   HE SET ON THE EARTH MOUNTAINS STANDING FIRM  LEST IT SHOULD SHAKE WITH YOU   AND HE SCATTERED THROUGH IT BEASTS OF ALL KINDS  WE SEND DOWN RAIN FROM THE SKY  AND PRODUCE ON THE EARTH EVERY KIND OF NOBLE CREATURE  IN PAIRS 
   SUCH IS THE CREATION OF GOD   NOW SHOW ME WHAT IS THERE THAT OTHERS BESIDES HIM HAVE CREATED   NAY  BUT THE TRANSGRESSORS ARE IN MANIFEST ERROR SECTION  
   WE BESTOWED  IN THE PAST  WISDOM ON LUQMĀN     SHOW  THY  GRATITUDE TO GOD   ANY WHO IS  SO  GRATEFUL DOES SO TO THE PROFIT OF HIS OWN SOUL   BUT IF ANY IS UNGRATEFUL  VERILY GOD IS FREE OF ALL WANTS  WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE 
   BEHOLD  LUQMĀN SAID TO HIS SON BY WAY OF INSTRUCTION     O MY SON   JOIN NOT IN WORSHIP  OTHERS  WITH GOD   FOR FALSE WORSHIP IS INDEED THE HIGHEST WRONG DOING  
   AND WE HAVE ENJOINED ON MAN  TO BE GOOD  TO HIS PARENTS   IN TRAVAIL UPON TRAVAIL DID HIS MOTHER BEAR HIM  AND IN YEARS TWAIN WAS HIS WEANING    HEAR THE COMMAND     SHOW GRATITUDE TO ME AND TO THY PARENTS   TO ME IS  THY FINAL  GOAL 
     BUT IF THEY STRIVE TO MAKE THE JOIN IN WORSHIP WITH ME THINGS OF WHICH THOU HAST NO KNOWLEDGE  OBEY THEM NOT   YET BEAR THEM COMPANY IN THIS LIFE WITH JUSTICE  AND CONSIDERATION   AND FOLLOW THE WAY OF THOSE WHO TURN TO ME  IN LOVE    IN THE END THE RETURN OF YOU ALL IS TO ME  AND I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH  AND MEANING  OF ALL THAT YE DID  
     O MY SON      SAID LUQMĀN     IF THERE BE  BUT  THE WEIGHT OF A MUSTARD SEED AND IT WERE  HIDDEN  IN A ROCK  OR  ANYWHERE  IN THE HEAVENS OR ON EARTH  GOD WILL BRING IT FORTH   FOR GOD UNDERSTANDS THE FINEST MYSTERIES   AND  IS WELL ACQUAINTED  WITH THEM  
     O MY SON   ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER ENJOIN WHAT IS JUST  AND FORBID WHAT IS WRONG   AND BEAR WITH PATIENT CONSTANCY WHATE ER BETIDE THEE   FOR THIS IS FIRMNESS  OF PURPOSE  IN  THE CONDUCT OF  AFFAIRS 
     AND SWELL NOT THY CHEEK  FOR PRIDE  AT MEN  NOR WALK IN INSOLENCE THROUGH THE EARTH   FOR GOD LOVETH NOT ANY ARROGANT BOASTER 
     AND BE MODERATE IN THY PACE  AND LOWER THY VOICE   FOR THE HARSHEST OF SOUNDS WITHOUT DOUBT IS THE BRAYING OF THE ASS  SECTION  
   DO YE NOT SEE THAT GOD HAS SUBJECTED TO YOUR  USE  ALL THINGS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  AND HAS MADE HIS BOUNTIES FLOW TO YOU IN EXCEEDING MEASURE   BOTH  SEEN AND UNSEEN   YET THERE ARE AMONG MEN THOSE WHO DISPUTE ABOUT GOD  WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE AND WITHOUT GUIDANCE AND WITHOUT A BOOK TO ENLIGHTEN THEM  
   WHEN THEY ARE TOLD TO FOLLOW THE  REVELATION  THAT GOD HAS SENT DOWN  THEY SAY     NAY  WE SHALL FOLLOW THE WAYS THAT WE FOUND OUR FATHERS  FOLLOWING    WHAT   EVEN IF IT IS SATAN BECKONING THEM TO THE PENALTY OF THE  BLAZING  FIRE  
   WHOEVER SUBMITS HIS WHOLE SELF TO GOD  AND IS A DOER OF GOOD  HAS GRASPED INDEED THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY HAND HOLD   AND WITH GOD RESTS THE END AND DECISION OF  ALL  AFFAIRS 
   BUT IF ANY REJECT FAITH  LET NOT HIS REJECTION GRIEVE THEE   TO US IS THEIR RETURN AND WE SHALL TELL THEM THE TRUTH OF THEIR DEEDS   FOR GOD KNOWS WELL ALL THAT IS IN  MEN S  HEARTS 
   WE GRANT THEM THEIR PLEASURE FOR A LITTLE WHILE   IN THE END SHALL WE DRIVE THEM TO A CHASTISEMENT UNRELENTING 
   IF THOU ASK THEM  WHO IT IS THAT CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  THEY WILL CERTAINLY SAY    GOD    SAY     PRAISE BE TO GOD     BUT MOST OF THEM UNDERSTAND NOT 
   TO GOD BELONG ALL THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH   VERILY GOD IS HE  THAT IS  FREE OF ALL WANTS  WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE 
   AND IF ALL THE TREES ON EARTH WERE PENS AND THE OCEAN  WERE INK   WITH SEVEN OCEANS BEHIND IT TO ADD TO ITS  SUPPLY   YET WOULD NOT THE WORDS OF GOD BE EXHAUSTED  IN THE WRITING    FOR GOD IS EXALTED IN POWER  FULL OF WISDOM 
   AND YOUR CREATION OR YOUR RESURRECTION IS IN NO WISE BUT AS AN INDIVIDUAL SOUL   FOR GOD IS HE WHO HEARS AND SEES  ALL THINGS  
   SEEST THOU NOT THAT GOD MERGES NIGHT INTO DAY AND HE MERGES DAY INTO NIGHT   THAT HE HAS SUBJECTED THE SUN AND THE MOON  TO HIS LAW   EACH RUNNING ITS COURSE FOR A TERM APPOINTED   AND THAT GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THAT YE DO  
   THAT IS BECAUSE GOD IS THE  ONLY  REALITY  AND BECAUSE WHATEVER ELSE THEY INVOKE BESIDES HIM IS FALSEHOOD   AND BECAUSE GOD  HE IS THE MOST HIGH  MOST GREAT SECTION  
   SEEST THOU NOT THAT THE SHIPS SAIL THROUGH THE OCEAN BY THE GRACE OF GOD   THAT HE MAY SHOW YOU OF HIS SIGNS   VERILY IN THIS ARE SIGNS FOR ALL WHO CONSTANTLY PERSEVERE AND GIVE THANKS 
   WHEN A WAVE COVERS THEM LIKE THE CANOPY  OF CLOUDS   THEY CALL TO GOD  OFFERING HIM SINCERE DEVOTION  BUT WHEN HE HAS DELIVERED THEM SAFELY TO LAND  THERE ARE AMONG THEM THOSE THAT HALT BETWEEN  RIGHT AND WRONG   BUT NONE REJECT OUR SIGNS EXCEPT ONLY A PERFIDIOUS UNGRATEFUL  WRETCH   
   O MANKIND   DO YOUR DUTY TO YOUR LORD  AND FEAR  THE COMING OF  A DAY WHEN NO FATHER CAN AVAIL AUGHT FOR HIS SON  NOR A SON AVAIL AUGHT FOR HIS FATHER  VERILY  THE PROMISE OF GOD IS TRUE   LET NOT THEN THIS PRESENT LIFE DECEIVE YOU  NOR LET THE CHIEF DECEIVER DECEIVE YOU ABOUT GOD 
   VERILY THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOUR IS WITH GOD  ALONE   IT IS HE WHO SENDS DOWN RAIN  AND HE WHO KNOWS WHAT IS IN THE WOMBS  NOR DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT HE WILL EARN ON THE MORROW   NOR DOES ANYONE KNOW IN WHAT LAND HE IS TO DIE  VERILY WITH GOD IS FULL KNOWLEDGE AND HE IS ACQUAINTED  WITH ALL THINGS  
   A  L  M 
    THIS IS  THE REVELATION OF THE BOOK IN WHICH THERE IS NO DOUBT   FROM THE LORD OF THE WORLDS 
   OR DO THEY SAY    HE HAS FORGED IT     NAY  IT IS THE TRUTH FROM THY LORD  THAT THOU MAYEST ADMONISH A PEOPLE TO WHOM NO WARNER HAS COME BEFORE THEE   IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY RECEIVE GUIDANCE 
   IT IS GOD WHO HAS CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND ALL BETWEEN THEM  IN SIX DAYS  AND IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED ON THE THRONE  OF AUTHORITY    YE HAVE NONE  BESIDES HIM  TO PROTECT OR INTERCEDE  FOR YOU    WILL YE NOT THEN RECEIVE ADMONITION  
   HE RULES  ALL  AFFAIRS FROM THE HEAVENS TO THE EARTH   IN THE END WILL  ALL AFFAIRS  GO UP TO HIM  ON A DAY  THE SPACE WHEREOF WILL BE  AS  A THOUSAND YEARS OF YOUR RECKONING 
   SUCH IS HE  THE KNOWER OF ALL THINGS  HIDDEN AND OPEN  THE EXALTED  IN POWER   THE MERCIFUL   
   HE WHO HAS MADE EVERYTHING WHICH HE HAS CREATED MOST GOOD   HE BEGAN THE CREATION OF MAN WITH  NOTHING MORE THAN  CLAY 
   AND MADE HIS PROGENY FROM A QUINTESSENCE OF THE NATURE OF A FLUID DESPISED  
   BUT HE FASHIONED HIM IN DUE PROPORTION  AND BREATHED INTO HIM SOMETHING OF HIS SPIRIT  AND HE GAVE YOU  THE FACULTIES OF  HEARING AND SIGHT AND FEELING  AND UNDERSTANDING    LITTLE THANKS DO YE GIVE  
   AND THEY SAY     WHAT   WHEN WE LIE HIDDEN AND LOST  IN THE EARTH  SHALL WE INDEED BE IN A CREATION RENEWED     NAY  THEY DENY THE MEETING WITH THEIR LORD  
   SAY     THE ANGEL OF DEATH  PUT IN CHARGE OF YOU  WILL  DULY  TAKE YOUR SOULS   THEN SHALL YE BE BROUGHT BACK TO YOUR LORD  SECTION  
   IF ONLY THOU COULDST SEE WHEN THE GUILTY ONES WILL BEND LOW THEIR HEADS BEFORE THEIR LORD  SAYING &COLON     OUR LORD   WE HAVE SEEN AND WE HAVE HEARD   NOW THEN SEND US BACK  TO THE WORLD    WE WILL WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS   FOR WE DO INDEED  NOW  BELIEVE  
   IF WE HAD SO WILLED  WE COULD CERTAINLY HAVE BROUGHT EVERY SOUL ITS TRUE GUIDANCE   BUT THE WORD FROM ME WILL COME TRUE    I WILL FILL HELL WITH JINNS AND MEN ALL TOGETHER  
     TASTE YE THEN FOR YE FORGOT THE MEETING OF THIS DAY OF YOURS  AND WE TOO WILL FORGET YOU TASTE YE THE PENALTY OF ETERNITY FOR YOUR  EVIL  DEEDS    
   ONLY THOSE BELIEVE IN OUR SIGNS  WHO  WHEN THEY ARE RECITED TO THEM  FALL DOWN IN ADORATION  AND CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF THEIR LORD  NOR ARE THEY  EVER  PUFFED UP WITH PRIDE 
   THEIR LIMBS DO FORSAKE THEIR BEDS OF SLEEP  THE WHILE THEY CALL ON THEIR LORD IN FEAR AND HOPE   AND THEY SPEND  IN CHARITY  OUT OF THE SUSTENANCE WHICH WE HAVE BESTOWED ON THEM 
   NOW NO PERSON KNOWS WHAT DELIGHTS OF THE EYE ARE KEPT HIDDEN  IN RESERVE  FOR THEM AS A REWARD FOR THEIR  GOOD  DEEDS 
   IS THEN THE MAN WHO BELIEVES NO BETTER THAN THE MAN WHO IS REBELLIOUS AND WICKED   NOT EQUAL ARE THEY 
   FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND DO RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  ARE GARDENS AS HOSPITABLE HOMES  FOR THEIR  GOOD  DEEDS 
   AS TO THOSE WHO ARE REBELLIOUS AND WICKED  THEIR ABODE WILL BE THE FIRE   EVERY TIME THEY WISH TO GET AWAY THEREFROM  THEY WILL BE FORCED THEREINTO  AND IT WILL BE SAID TO THEM     TASTE YE THE PENALTY OF THE FIRE  THE WHICH YE WERE WONT TO REJECT AS FALSE  
   AND INDEED WE WILL MAKE THEM TASTE OF THE PENALTY OF THIS  LIFE  PRIOR TO THE SUPREME PENALTY  IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY  REPENT AND  RETURN 
   AND WHO DOES MORE WRONG THAN ONE TO WHOM ARE RECITED THE SIGNS OF HIS LORD  AND WHO THEN TURNS AWAY THEREFROM   VERILY FROM THOSE WHO TRANSGRESS WE SHALL EXACT  DUE  RETRIBUTION SECTION  
   WE DID INDEED AFORETIME GIVE THE BOOK TO MOSES   BE NOT THEN IN DOUBT OF ITS REACHING  THEE    AND WE MADE IT A GUIDE TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL 
   AND WE APPOINTED  FROM AMONG THEM  LEADERS  GIVING GUIDANCE UNDER OUR COMMAND  SO LONG AS THEY PERSEVERED WITH PATIENCE AND CONTINUED TO HAVE FAITH IN OUR SIGNS 
   VERILY THY LORD WILL JUDGE BETWEEN THEM ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT  IN THE MATTERS WHEREIN THEY DIFFER  AMONG THEMSELVES  
   DOES IT NOT TEACH THEM A LESSON  HOW MANY GENERATIONS WE DESTROYED BEFORE THEM  IN WHOSE DWELLINGS THEY  NOW  GO TO AND FRO   VERILY IN THAT ARE SIGNS   DO THEY NOT THEN LISTEN  
   AND DO THEY NOT SEE THAT WE DO DRIVE RAIN TO PARCHED SOIL  BARE OF HERBAGE   AND PRODUCE THEREWITH CROPS  PROVIDING FOOD FOR THEIR CATTLE AND THEMSELVES   HAVE THEY NOT THE VISION  
   THEY SAY     WHEN WILL THIS DECISION BE  IF YE ARE TELLING THE TRUTH    
   SAY     ON THE DAY OF DECISION  NO PROFIT WILL IT BE TO UNBELIEVERS IF THEY  THEN  BELIEVE   NOR WILL THEY BE GRANTED A RESPITE  
   SO TURN AWAY FROM THEM  AND WAIT   THEY TOO ARE WAITING 
   O PROPHET   FEAR GOD  AND HEARKEN NOT TO THE UNBELIEVERS AND THE HYPOCRITES   VERILY GOD IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM 
   BUT FOLLOW THAT WHICH COMES TO THEE BY INSPIRATION FROM THY LORD   FOR GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH  ALL  THAT YE DO 
   AND PUT THY TRUST IN GOD  AND ENOUGH IS GOD AS A DISPOSER OF AFFAIRS 
   GOD HAS NOT MADE FOR ANY MAN TWO HEARTS IN HIS  ONE  BODY   NOR HAS HE MADE YOUR WIVES WHOM YE DIVORCE BY ẒIHĀR YOUR MOTHERS   NOR HAS HE MADE YOUR ADOPTED SONS YOUR SONS  SUCH IS  ONLY  YOUR  MANNER OF  SPEECH BY YOUR MOUTHS  BUT GOD TELLS  YOU  THE TRUTH  AND HE SHOWS THE  RIGHT  WAY 
   CALL THEM BY  THE NAMES OF  THEIR FATHERS   THAT IS JUSTER IN THE SIGHT OF GOD  BUT IF YE KNOW NOT THEIR FATHER S  NAMES  CALL THEM  YOUR BROTHERS IN FAITH  OR YOUR MAULĀS  BUT THERE IS NO BLAME ON YOU IF YE MAKE A MISTAKE THEREIN    WHAT COUNTS IS  THE INTENTION OF YOUR HEARTS   AND GOD IS OFT RETURNING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   THE PROPHET IS CLOSER TO THE BELIEVERS THAN THEIR OWN SELVES  AND HIS WIVES ARE THEIR MOTHERS  BLOOD RELATIONS AMONG EACH OTHER HAVE CLOSER PERSONAL TIES  IN THE DECREE OF GOD  THAN  THE BROTHERHOOD OF  BELIEVERS AND MUHĀJIRS   NEVERTHELESS DO YE WHAT IS JUST TO YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS   SUCH IS THE WRITING IN THE DECREE  OF GOD  
   AND REMEMBER WE TOOK FROM THE PROPHETS THEIR COVENANT   AS  WE DID  FROM THEE   FROM NOAH  ABRAHAM  MOSES  AND JESUS THE SON OF MARY   WE TOOK FROM THEM A SOLEMN COVENANT  
   THAT  GOD  MAY QUESTION THE  CUSTODIANS  OF TRUTH CONCERNING THE TRUTH THEY  WERE CHARGED WITH    AND HE HAS PREPARED FOR THE UNBELIEVERS A GRIEVOUS PENALTY SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   REMEMBER THE GRACE OF GOD   BESTOWED  ON YOU  WHEN THERE CAME DOWN ON YOU HOSTS  TO OVERWHELM YOU    BUT WE SENT AGAINST THEM A HURRICANE AND FORCES THAT YE SAW NOT   BUT GOD SEES  CLEARLY  ALL THAT YE DO 
   BEHOLD   THEY CAME ON YOU FROM ABOVE YOU AND FROM BELOW YOU  AND BEHOLD  THE EYES BECAME DIM AND THE HEARTS GAPED UP TO THE THROATS  AND YE IMAGINED VARIOUS  VAIN  THOUGHTS ABOUT GOD  
   IN THAT SITUATION WERE THE BELIEVERS TRIED   THEY WERE SHAKEN AS BY A TREMENDOUS SHAKING 
   AND BEHOLD   THE HYPOCRITES AND THOSE IN WHOSE HEARTS IS A DISEASE  EVEN  SAY     GOD AND HIS APOSTLE PROMISED US NOTHING BUT DELUSIONS    
   BEHOLD   A PARTY AMONG THEM SAID     YE MEN OF YATHRIB   YE CANNOT STAND  THE ATTACK    THEREFORE GO BACK     AND A BAND OF THEM ASK FOR LEAVE OF THE PROPHET  SAYING    TRULY OUR HOUSES ARE BARE AND EXPOSED   THOUGH THEY WERE NOT EXPOSED   THEY INTENDED NOTHING BUT TO RUN AWAY 
   AND IF AN ENTRY HAD BEEN EFFECTED TO THEM FROM THE SIDES OF THE  CITY   AND THEY HAD BEEN INCITED TO SEDITION  THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BROUGHT IT TO PASS  WITH NONE BUT A BRIEF DELAY  
   AND YET THEY HAD ALREADY COVENANTED WITH GOD NOT TO TURN THEIR BACKS  AND A COVENANT WITH GOD MUST  SURELY  BE ANSWERED FOR 
   SAY     RUNNING AWAY WILL NOT PROFIT YOU IF YE ARE RUNNING AWAY FROM DEATH OR SLAUGHTER   AND EVEN IF  YE DO ESCAPE   NO MORE THAN A BRIEF  RESPITE  WILL YE BE ALLOWED TO ENJOY    
   SAY     WHO IS IT THAT CAN SCREEN YOU FROM GOD IF IT BE HIS WISH TO GIVE YOU PUNISHMENT OR TO GIVE YOU MERCY     NOR WILL THEY FIND FOR THEMSELVES  BESIDES GOD  ANY PROTECTOR OR HELPER 
   VERILY GOD KNOWS THOSE AMONG YOU WHO KEEP BACK  MEN  AND THOSE WHO SAY TO THEIR BRETHREN    COME ALONG TO US    BUT COME NOT TO THE FIGHT EXCEPT FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE 
   COVETOUS OVER YOU  THEN WHEN FEAR COMES  THOU WILT SEE THEM LOOKING TO THEE  THEIR EYES REVOLVING  LIKE  THOSE OF  ONE OVER WHOM HOVERS DEATH   BUT WHEN THE FEAR IS PAST  THEY WILL SMITE YOU WITH SHARP TONGUES  COVETOUS OF GOODS  SUCH MEN HAVE NO FAITH  AND SO GOD HAS MADE THEIR DEEDS OF NONE EFFECT   AND THAT IS EASY FOR GOD 
   THEY THINK THAT THE CONFEDERATES HAVE NOT WITHDRAWN   AND IF THE CONFEDERATES SHOULD COME  AGAIN   THEY WOULD WISH THEY WERE IN THE DESERTS  WANDERING  AMONG THE BEDOUINS  AND SEEKING NEWS ABOUT YOU  FROM A SAFE DISTANCE    AND IF THEY WERE IN YOUR MIDST  THEY WOULD FIGHT BUT LITTLE SECTION  
   YE HAVE INDEED IN THE APOSTLE OF GOD A BEAUTIFUL PATTERN  OF CONDUCT  FOR ANYONE WHOSE HOPE IS IN GOD AND THE FINAL DAY  AND WHO ENGAGES MUCH IN THE PRAISE OF GOD 
   WHEN THE BELIEVERS SAW THE CONFEDERATE FORCES  THEY SAID     THIS IS WHAT GOD AND HIS APOSTLE HAD PROMISED US  AND GOD AND HIS APOSTLE TOLD US WHAT WAS TRUE   AND IT ONLY ADDED TO THEIR FAITH AND THEIR ZEAL IN OBEDIENCE 
   AMONG THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN WHO HAVE BEEN TRUE TO THEIR COVENANT WITH GOD   OF THEM SOME HAVE COMPLETED THEIR VOW  TO THE EXTREME   AND SOME  STILL  WAIT   BUT THEY HAVE NEVER CHANGED  THEIR DETERMINATION  IN THE LEAST  
   THAT GOD MAY REWARD THE MEN OF TRUTH FOR THEIR TRUTH  AND PUNISH THE HYPOCRITES IF THAT BE HIS WILL  OR TURN TO THEM IN MERCY   FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   AND GOD TURNED BACK THE UNBELIEVERS FOR  ALL  THEIR FURY   NO ADVANTAGE DID THEY GAIN   AND ENOUGH IS GOD FOR THE BELIEVERS IN THEIR FIGHT  AND GOD IS FULL OF STRENGTH  ABLE TO ENFORCE HIS WILL 
   AND THOSE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK WHO AIDED THEM  GOD DID TAKE THEM DOWN FROM THEIR STRONGHOLDS AND CAST TERROR INTO THEIR HEARTS   SO THAT  SOME YE SLEW  AND SOME YE MADE PRISONERS 
   AND HE MADE YOU HEIRS OF THEIR LANDS  THEIR HOUSES  AND THEIR GOODS  AND OF A LAND WHICH YE HAD NOT FREQUENTED  BEFORE   AND GOD HAS POWER OVER ALL THINGS SECTION  
   O PROPHET   SAY TO THY CONSORTS     IF IT BE THAT YE DESIRE THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD  AND ITS GLITTER   THEN COME   I WILL PROVIDE FOR YOUR ENJOYMENT AND SET YOU FREE IN A HANDSOME MANNER 
     BUT IF YE SEEK GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  AND THE HOME OF THE HEREAFTER  VERILY GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THE WELL DOERS AMONGST YOU A GREAT REWARD  
   O CONSORTS OF THE PROPHET IF ANY OF YOU WERE GUILTY OF EVIDENT UNSEEMLY CONDUCT  THE PUNISHMENT WOULD BE DOUBLED TO HER  AND THAT IS EASY FOR GOD 
   BUT ANY OF YOU THAT IS DEVOUT IN THE SERVICE OF GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  AND WORKS RIGHTEOUSNESS   TO HER SHALL WE GRANT HER REWARD TWICE   AND WE HAVE PREPARED FOR HER A GENEROUS SUSTENANCE 
   O CONSORTS OF THE PROPHET   YE ARE NOT LIKE ANY OF THE  OTHER  WOMEN   IF YE DO FEAR  GOD   BE NOT TOO COMPLAISANT OF SPEECH  LEST ONE IN WHOSE HEART IS A DISEASE SHOULD BE MOVED WITH DESIRE   BUT SPEAK YE A SPEECH  THAT IS  JUST 
   AND STAY QUIETLY IN YOUR HOUSES  AND MAKE NOT A DAZZLING DISPLAY  LIKE THAT OF THE FORMER TIMES OF IGNORANCE   AND ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER  AND GIVE REGULAR CHARITY   AND OBEY GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  AND GOD ONLY WISHES TO REMOVE ALL ABOMINATION FROM YOU  YE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY  AND TO MAKE YOU PURE AND SPOTLESS 
   AND RECITE WHAT IS REHEARSED TO YOU IN YOUR HOMES  OF THE SIGNS OF GOD AND HIS WISDOM   FOR GOD UNDERSTANDS THE FINEST MYSTERIES AND IS WELL ACQUAINTED  WITH THEM  SECTION  
   FOR MUSLIM MEN AND WOMEN   FOR BELIEVING MEN AND WOMEN  FOR DEVOUT MEN AND WOMEN  FOR TRUE MEN AND WOMEN  FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE PATIENT AND CONSTANT  FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO HUMBLE THEMSELVES  FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO GIVE IN CHARITY  FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO FAST  AND DENY THEMSELVES   FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO GUARD THEIR CHASTITY  AND FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO ENGAGE MUCH IN GOD S PRAISE   FOR THEM HAS GOD PREPARED FORGIVENESS AND GREAT REWARD 
   IT IS NOT FITTING FOR A BELIEVER  MAN OR WOMAN  WHEN A MATTER HAS BEEN DECIDED BY GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  TO HAVE ANY OPTION ABOUT THEIR DECISION   IF ANYONE DISOBEYS GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  HE IS INDEED ON A CLEARLY WRONG PATH 
   BEHOLD   THOU DIDST SAY TO ONE WHO HAD RECEIVED THE GRACE OF GOD AND THY   RETAIN THOU  IN WEDLOCK  THY WIFE  AND FEAR GOD   BUT THOU DIDST HIDE IN THY HEART THAT WHICH GOD WAS ABOUT TO MAKE MANIFEST   THOU DIDST FEAR THE PEOPLE  BUT IT IS MORE FITTING THAT THOU SHOULDST FEAR GOD  THEN WHEN ZAID HAD DISSOLVED  HIS MARRIAGE  WITH HER  WITH THE NECESSARY  FORMALITY   WE JOINED HER IN MARRIAGE TO THEE   IN ORDER THAT  IN FUTURE  THERE MAY BE NO DIFFICULTY TO THE BELIEVERS IN  THE MATTER OF  MARRIAGE WITH THE WIVES OF THEIR ADOPTED SONS  WHEN THE LATTER HAVE DISSOLVED WITH THE NECESSARY  FORMALITY   THEIR MARRIAGE  WITH THEM  AND GOD S COMMAND MUST BE FULFILLED 
   THERE CAN BE NO DIFFICULTY TO THE PROPHET IN WHAT GOD HAS INDICATED TO HIM AS A DUTY  IT WAS THE PRACTICE  APPROVED  OF GOD AMONGST THOSE OF OLD THAT HAVE PASSED AWAY  AND THE COMMAND OF GOD IS A DECREE DETERMINED 
    IT IS THE PRACTICE OF THOSE  WHO PREACH THE MESSAGES OF GOD  AND FEAR HIM AND FEAR NONE BUT GOD  AND ENOUGH IS GOD TO CALL  MEN  TO ACCOUNT 
   MUHAMMAD IS NOT THE FATHER OF ANY OF YOUR MEN  BUT  HE IS  THE APOSTLE OF GOD  AND THE SEAL OF THE PROPHETS   AND GOD HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THINGS SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF GOD  AND DO THIS OFTEN  
   AND GLORIFY HIM MORNING AND EVENING 
   HE IT IS WHO SENDS BLESSINGS ON YOU  AS DO HIS ANGELS  THAT HE MAY BRING YOU OUT FROM THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS INTO LIGHT   AND HE IS FULL OF MERCY TO THE BELIEVERS 
   THEIR SALUTATION ON THE DAY THEY MEET HIM WILL BE   PEACE       AND HE HAS PREPARED FOR THEM A GENEROUS REWARD 
   O PROPHET   TRULY WE HAVE SENT THEE AS A WITNESS  A BEARER OF GLAD TIDINGS  AND A WARNER  
   AND AS ONE WHO INVITES TO GOD S  GRACE  BY HIS LEAVE  AND AS A LAMP SPREADING LIGHT 
   THEN GIVE THE GLAD TIDINGS TO THE BELIEVERS  THAT THEY SHALL HAVE FROM GOD A VERY GREAT BOUNTY 
   AND OBEY NOT  THE BEHESTS  OF THE UNBELIEVERS AND THE HYPOCRITES  AND HEED NOT THEIR ANNOYANCES  BUT PUT THY TRUST IN GOD FOR ENOUGH IS GOD AS A DISPOSER OF AFFAIRS 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   WHEN YE MARRY BELIEVING WOMEN  AND THEN DIVORCE THEM BEFORE YE HAVE TOUCHED THEM  NO PERIOD OF  IDDAT HAVE YE TO COUNT IN RESPECT OF THEM   SO GIVE THEM A PRESENT  AND SET THEM FREE IN A HANDSOME MANNER 
   O PROPHET   WE HAVE MADE LAWFUL TO THEE THY WIVES TO WHOM THOU HAST PAID THEIR DOWERS   AND THOSE WHOM THY RIGHT HAND POSSESSES OUT OF THE PRISONERS OF WAR WHOM GOD HAS ASSIGNED TO THEE   AND DAUGHTERS OF THY PATERNAL UNCLES AND AUNTS  AND DAUGHTERS OF THY MATERNAL UNCLES AND AUNTS  WHO MIGRATED  FROM MECCA  WITH THEE   AND ANY BELIEVING WOMAN WHO DEDICATES HER SOUL TO THE PROPHET IF THE PROPHET WISHES TO WED HER    THIS ONLY FOR THEE  AND NOT FOR THE BELIEVERS  AT LARGE    WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE APPOINTED FOR THEM AS TO THEIR WIVES AND THE CAPTIVES WHOM THEIR RIGHT HANDS POSSESS    IN ORDER THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY FOR THEE  AND GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   THOU MAYEST DEFER  THE TURN OF  ANY OF THEM THAT THOU PLEASEST  AND THOU MAYEST RECEIVE ANY THOU PLEASEST   AND THERE IS NO BLAME ON THEE IF THOU INVITE ONE WHOSE  TURN  THOU HADST SET ASIDE  THIS WERE NIGHER TO THE COOLING OF THEIR EYES  THE PREVENTION OF THEIR GRIEF  AND THEIR SATISFACTION  THAT OF ALL OF THEM  WITH THAT WHICH THOU HAST TO GIVE THEM   AND GOD KNOWS  ALL  THAT IS IN YOUR HEARTS   AND GOD IS ALL KNOWING  MOST FORBEARING 
   IT IS NOT LAWFUL FOR THEE  TO MARRY MORE  WOMEN AFTER THIS  NOR TO CHANGE THEM FOR  OTHER  WIVES  EVEN THOUGH THEIR BEAUTY ATTRACT THEE EXCEPT ANY THY RIGHT HAND SHOULD POSSESS  AS HANDMAIDENS    AND GOD DOTH WATCH OVER ALL THINGS SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   ENTER NOT THE PROPHET S HOUSES   UNTIL LEAVE IS GIVEN YOU   FOR A MEAL   AND THEN  NOT  SO EARLY AS  TO WAIT FOR ITS PREPARATION   BUT WHEN YE ARE INVITED  ENTER   AND WHEN YE HAVE TAKEN YOUR MEAL  DISPERSE  WITHOUT SEEKING FAMILIAR TALK  SUCH  BEHAVIOUR  ANNOYS THE PROPHET   HE IS ASHAMED TO DISMISS YOU BUT GOD IS NOT ASHAMED  TO TELL YOU  THE TRUTH  AND WHEN YE ASK  HIS LADIES  FOR ANYTHING YE WANT  ASK THEM FROM BEFORE A SCREEN   THAT MAKES FOR GREATER PURITY FOR YOUR HEARTS AND FOR THEIRS  NOR IS IT RIGHT FOR YOU THAT YE SHOULD ANNOY GOD S APOSTLE  OR THAT YE SHOULD MARRY HIS WIDOWS AFTER HIM AT ANY TIME  TRULY SUCH A THING IS IN GOD S SIGHT AN ENORMITY 
   WHETHER YE REVEAL ANYTHING OR CONCEAL IT  VERILY GOD HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THINGS 
   THERE IS NO BLAME  ON THESE LADIES IF THEY APPEAR  BEFORE THEIR FATHERS OR THEIR SONS  THEIR BROTHERS  OR THEIR BROTHERS  SONS  OR THEIR SISTERS  SONS  OR THEIR WOMEN  OR THE  SLAVES  WHOM THEIR RIGHT HANDS POSSESS  AND   LADIES   FEAR GOD   FOR GOD IS WITNESS TO ALL THINGS 
   GOD AND HIS ANGELS SEND BLESSINGS ON THE PROPHET   O YE THAT BELIEVE   SEND YE BLESSINGS ON HIM  AND SALUTE HIM WITH ALL RESPECT 
   THOSE WHO ANNOY GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  GOD HAS CURSED THEM IN THIS WORLD AND IN THE HEREAFTER  AND HAS PREPARED FOR THEM A HUMILIATING PUNISHMENT 
   AND THOSE WHO ANNOY BELIEVING MEN AND WOMEN UNDESERVEDLY  BEAR  ON THEMSELVES  A CALUMNY AND A GLARING SIN SECTION  
   O PROPHET   TELL THY WIVES AND DAUGHTERS  AND THE BELIEVING WOMEN  THAT THEY SHOULD CAST THEIR OUTER GARMENTS OVER THEIR PERSONS  WHEN ABROAD    THAT IS MOST CONVENIENT  THAT THEY SHOULD BE KNOWN  AS SUCH  AND NOT MOLESTED  AND GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   TRULY  IF THE HYPOCRITES  AND THOSE IN WHOSE HEARTS IS A DISEASE  AND THOSE WHO STIR UP SEDITION IN THE CITY  DESIST NOT  WE SHALL CERTAINLY STIR THEE UP AGAINST THEM   THEN WILL THEY NOT BE ABLE TO STAY IN IT AS THY NEIGHBOURS FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME  
   THEY SHALL HAVE A CURSE ON THEM   WHEREVER THEY ARE FOUND  THEY SHALL BE SEIZED AND SLAIN  WITHOUT MERCY  
    SUCH WAS  THE PRACTICE  APPROVED  OF GOD AMONG THOSE WHO LIVED AFORETIME   NO CHANGE WILT THOU FIND IN THE PRACTICE  APPROVED  OF GOD 
   MEN ASK THEE CONCERNING THE HOUR   SAY    THE KNOWLEDGE THEREOF IS WITH GOD  ALONE      AND WHAT WILL MAKE THEE UNDERSTAND   PERCHANCE THE HOUR IS NIGH  
   VERILY GOD HAS CURSED THE UNBELIEVERS AND PREPARED FOR THEM A BLAZING FIRE  
   TO DWELL THEREIN FOR EVER   NO PROTECTOR WILL THEY FIND  NOR HELPER 
   THE DAY THAT THEIR FACES WILL BE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN IN THE FIRE  THEY WILL SAY     WOE TO US   WOULD THAT WE HAD OBEYED GOD AND OBEYED THE APOSTLE    
   AND THEY WOULD SAY     OUR LORD   WE OBEYED OUR CHIEFS AND OUR GREAT ONES  AND THEY MISLED US AS TO THE  RIGHT  PATH 
     OUR LORD   GIVE THEM DOUBLE PENALTY AND CURSE THEM WITH A VERY GREAT CURSE    SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   BE YE NOT LIKE THOSE WHO VEXED AND INSULTED MOSES  BUT GOD CLEARED HIM OF THE  CALUMNIES  THEY HAD UTTERED   AND HE WAS HONOURABLE IN GOD S SIGHT 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   FEAR GOD  AND  ALWAYS  SAY A WORD DIRECTED TO THE RIGHT  
   THAT HE MAY MAKE YOUR CONDUCT WHOLE AND SOUND AND FORGIVE YOU YOUR SINS   HE THAT OBEYS GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  HAS ALREADY ATTAINED THE HIGHEST ACHIEVEMENT 
   WE DID INDEED OFFER THE TRUST TO THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND THE MOUNTAINS   BUT THEY REFUSED TO UNDERTAKE IT  BEING AFRAID THEREOF   BUT MAN UNDERTOOK IT    HE WAS INDEED UNJUST AND FOOLISH   
    WITH THE RESULT  THAT GOD HAS TO PUNISH THE HYPOCRITES  MEN AND WOMEN  AND THE UNBELIEVERS  MEN AND WOMEN  AND GOD TURNS IN MERCY TO THE BELIEVERS  MEN AND WOMEN   FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   PRAISE BE TO GOD  TO WHOM BELONG ALL THINGS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   TO HIM BE PRAISE IN THE HEREAFTER   AND HE IS FULL OF WISDOM  ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THINGS 
   HE KNOWS ALL THAT GOES INTO THE EARTH  AND ALL THAT COMES OUT THEREOF   ALL THAT COMES DOWN FROM THE SKY AND ALL THAT ASCENDS THERETO   AND HE IS THE MOST MERCIFUL  THE OFT FORGIVING 
   THE UNBELIEVERS SAY    NEVER TO US WILL COME THE HOUR     SAY    NAY   BUT MOST SURELY  BY MY LORD  IT WILL COME UPON YOU   BY HIM WHO KNOWS THE UNSEEN   FROM WHOM IS NOT HIDDEN THE LEAST LITTLE ATOM IN THE HEAVENS OR ON EARTH   NOR IS THERE ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT  OR GREATER  BUT IS IN THE RECORD PERSPICUOUS  
   THAT HE MAY REWARD THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS   FOR SUCH IS FORGIVENESS AND A SUSTENANCE MOST GENEROUS  
   BUT THOSE WHO STRIVE AGAINST OUR SIGNS  TO FRUSTRATE THEM  FOR SUCH WILL BE A PENALTY  A PUNISHMENT MOST HUMILIATING 
   AND THOSE TO WHOM KNOWLEDGE HAS COME SEE THAT THE  REVELATION  SENT DOWN TO THEE FROM THY LORD  THAT IS THE TRUTH  AND THAT IT GUIDES TO THE PATH OF THE EXALTED  IN MIGHT   WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE 
   THE UNBELIEVERS SAY  IN RIDICULE      SHALL WE POINT OUT TO YOU A MAN THAT WILL TELL YOU  WHEN YE ARE ALL SCATTERED TO PIECES IN DISINTEGRATION  THAT YE SHALL  THEN BE RAISED  IN A NEW CREATION  
     HAS HE INVENTED A FALSEHOOD AGAINST GOD  OR HAS A SPIRIT  SEIZED  HIM     NAY  IT IS THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT IN THE HEREAFTER  THAT ARE IN  REAL  PENALTY  AND IN FARTHEST ERROR 
   SEE THEY NOT WHAT IS BEFORE THEM AND BEHIND THEM  OF THE SKY AND THE EARTH   IF WE WISHED  WE COULD CAUSE THE EARTH TO SWALLOW THEM UP  OR CAUSE A PIECE OF THE SKY TO FALL UPON THEM  VERILY IN THIS IS A SIGN FOR EVERY DEVOTEE THAT TURNS TO GOD  IN REPENTANCE  SECTION  
   WE BESTOWED GRACE AFORETIME ON DAVID FROM OURSELVES     O YE MOUNTAINS   SING YE BACK THE PRAISES OF GOD WITH HIM   AND YE BIRDS  ALSO    AND WE MADE THE IRON SOFT FOR HIM   
    COMMANDING     MAKE THOU COATS OF MAIL  BALANCING WELL THE RINGS OF CHAIN ARMOUR  AND WORK YE RIGHTEOUSNESS   FOR BE SURE I SEE  CLEARLY  ALL THAT YE DO  
   AND TO SOLOMON  WE MADE  THE WIND  OBEDIENT    ITS EARLY MORNING  STRIDE  WAS A MONTH S  JOURNEY   AND ITS EVENING  STRIDE  WAS A MONTH S  JOURNEY    AND WE MADE A FONT OF MOLTEN BRASS TO FLOW FOR HIM   AND THERE WERE JINNS THAT WORKED IN FRONT OF HIM  BY THE LEAVE OF HIS LORD  AND IF ANY OF THEM TURNED ASIDE FROM OUR COMMAND  WE MADE HIM TASTE OF THE PENALTY OF THE BLAZING FIRE 
   THEY WORKED FOR HIM AS HE DESIRED   MAKING  ARCHES  IMAGES  BASONS AS LARGE AS RESERVOIRS  AND  COOKING  CAULDRONS FIXED  IN THEIR PLACES      WORK YE  SONS OF DAVID  WITH THANKS   BUT FEW OF MY SERVANTS ARE GRATEFUL   
   THEN  WHEN WE DECREED  SOLOMON S  DEATH  NOTHING SHOWED THEM HIS DEATH EXCEPT A LITTLE WORM OF THE EARTH  WHICH KEPT  SLOWLY  GNAWING AWAY AT HIS STAFF   SO WHEN HE FELL DOWN  THE JINNS SAW PLAINLY THAT IF THEY HAD KNOWN THE UNSEEN  THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TARRIED IN THE HUMILIATING PENALTY  OF THEIR TASK  
   THERE WAS  FOR SABĀ  AFORETIME  A SIGN IN THEIR HOME LAND TWO GARDENS TO THE RIGHT AND TO THE LEFT    EAT OF THE SUSTENANCE  PROVIDED  BY YOUR LORD  AND BE GRATEFUL TO HIM   A TERRITORY FAIR AND HAPPY  AND A LORD OFT FORGIVING   
   BUT THEY TURNED AWAY  FROM GOD   AND WE SENT AGAINST THEM THE FLOOD  RELEASED  FROM THE DAMS  AND WE CONVERTED THEIR TWO GARDEN  ROWS  INTO   GARDENS   PRODUCING BITTER FRUIT  AND TAMARISKS  AND SOME FEW  STUNTED  LOTE TREES 
   THAT WAS THE REQUITAL WE GAVE THEM BECAUSE THEY UNGRATEFULLY REJECTED FAITH   AND NEVER DO WE GIVE  SUCH  REQUITAL EXCEPT TO SUCH AS ARE UNGRATEFUL REJECTERS 
   BETWEEN THEM AND THE CITIES ON WHICH WE HAD POURED OUR BLESSINGS  WE HAD PLACED CITIES IN PROMINENT POSITIONS  AND BETWEEN THEM WE HAD APPOINTED STAGES OF JOURNEY IN DUE PROPORTION     TRAVEL THEREIN  SECURE  BY NIGHT AND BY DAY  
   BUT THEY SAID     OUR LORD   PLACE LONGER DISTANCES BETWEEN OUR JOURNEY STAGES     BUT THEY WRONGED THEMSELVES  THEREIN   AT LENGTH WE MADE THEM AS A TALE  THAT IS TOLD   AND WE DISPERSED THEM ALL IN SCATTERED FRAGMENTS  VERILY IN THIS ARE SIGNS FOR EVERY  SOUL THAT IS  PATIENTLY CONSTANT AND GRATEFUL 
   AND ON THEM DID SATAN PROVE TRUE HIS IDEA  AND THEY FOLLOWED HIM  ALL BUT A PARTY THAT BELIEVED 
   BUT HE HAD NO AUTHORITY OVER THEM  EXCEPT THAT WE MIGHT TEST THE MAN WHO BELIEVES IN THE HEREAFTER FROM HIM WHO IS IN DOUBT CONCERNING IT   AND THY LORD DOTH WATCH OVER ALL THINGS SECTION  
   SAY     CALL UPON OTHER  GODS  WHOM YE FANCY  BESIDES GOD   THEY HAVE NO POWER   NOT THE WEIGHT OF AN ATOM   IN THE HEAVENS OR ON EARTH   NO  SORT OF  SHARE HAVE THEY THEREIN  NOR IS ANY OF THEM A HELPER TO GOD 
     NO INTERCESSION CAN AVAIL IN HIS PRESENCE  EXCEPT FOR THOSE FOR WHOM HE HAS GRANTED PERMISSION  SO FAR  IS THIS THE CASE  THAT  WHEN TERROR IS REMOVED FROM THEIR HEARTS  AT THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT  THEN  WILL THEY SAY    WHAT IS IT THAT YOUR LORD COMMANDED    THEY WILL SAY    THAT WHICH IS TRUE AND JUST   AND HE IS THE MOST HIGH  MOST GREAT    
   SAY     WHO GIVES YOU SUSTENANC  FROM THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH    SAY     IT IS GOD   AND CERTAIN IT IS THAT EITHER WE OR YE ARE ON RIGHT GUIDANCE OR IN MANIFEST ERROR   
   SAY     YE SHALL NOT BE QUESTIONED AS TO OUR SINS  NOR SHALL WE BE QUESTIONED AS TO WHAT YE DO  
   SAY     OUR LORD WILL GATHER US TOGETHER AND WILL IN THE END DECIDE THE MATTER BETWEEN US  AND YOU  IN TRUTH AND JUSTICE   AND HE IS THE ONE TO DECIDE  THE ONE WHO KNOWS ALL  
   SAY     SHOW ME THOSE WHOM YE HAVE JOINED WITH HIM AS PARTNERS   BY NO MEANS  CAN YE   NAY  HE IS GOD  THE EXALTED IN POWER  THE WISE  
   WE HAVE NOT SENT THEE BUT AS A UNIVERSAL  MESSENGER  TO MEN  GIVING THEM GLAD TIDINGS  AND WARNING THEM  AGAINST SIN   BUT MOST MEN UNDERSTAND NOT 
   THEY SAY     WHEN WILL THIS PROMISE  COME TO PASS  IF YE ARE TELLING THE TRUTH   
   SAY     THE APPOINTMENT TO YOU IS FOR A DAY  WHICH YE CANNOT PUT BACK FOR AN HOUR NOR PUT FORWARD  SECTION  
   THE UNBELIEVERS SAY     WE SHALL NEITHER BELIEVE IN THIS SCRIPTURE NOR IN  ANY  THAT  CAME  BEFORE IT   COULDST THOU BUT SEE WHEN THE WRONG DOERS WILL BE MADE TO STAND BEFORE THEIR LORD  THROWING BACK THE WORD  OF BLAME  ON ONE ANOTHER   THOSE WHO HAD BEEN DESPISED WILL SAY TO THE ARROGANT ONES     HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR YOU  WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN BELIEVERS   
   THE ARROGANT ONES WILL SAY TO THOSE WHO HAD BEEN DESPISED     WAS IT WE WHO KEPT YOU BACK FROM GUIDANCE AFTER IT REACHED YOU   NAY  RATHER  IT WAS YE WHO TRANSGRESSED  
   THOSE WHO HAD BEEN DESPISED WILL SAY TO THE ARROGANT ONES     NAY   IT WAS A PLOT  OF YOURS  BY DAY AND BY NIGHT   BEHOLD   YE  CONSTANTLY  ORDERED US TO BE UNGRATEFUL TO GOD AND TO ATTRIBUTE EQUALS TO HIM    THEY WILL DECLARE  THEIR  REPENTANCE WHEN THEY SEE THE PENALTY   WE SHALL PUT YOKES ON THE NECKS OF THE UNBELIEVERS   IT WOULD ONLY BE A REQUITAL FOR THEIR  ILL  DEEDS 
   NEVER DID WE SEND A WARNER TO A POPULATION  BUT THE WEALTHY ONES AMONG THEM SAID     WE BELIEVE NOT IN THE  MESSAGE  WITH WHICH YE HAVE BEEN SENT  
   THEY SAID     WE HAVE MORE IN WEALTH AND IN SONS  AND WE CANNOT BE PUNISHED  
   SAY     VERILY MY LORD ENLARGES AND RESTRICTS THE PROVISION TO WHOM HE PLEASES  BUT MOST MEN UNDERSTAND NOT  SECTION  
   IT IS NOT YOUR WEALTH NOR YOUR SONS  THAT WILL BRING YOU NEARER TO US IN DEGREE   BUT ONLY THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS THESE ARE THE ONES FOR WHOM THERE IS A MULTIPLIED REWARD FOR THEIR DEEDS  WHILE SECURE THEY  RESIDE  IN THE DWELLINGS ON HIGH  
   THOSE WHO STRIVE AGAINST OUR SIGNS  TO FRUSTRATE THEM  WILL BE GIVEN OVER INTO PUNISHMENT 
   SAY     VERILY MY LORD ENLARGES AND RESTRICTS THE SUSTENANCE TO SUCH OF HIS SERVANTS AS HE PLEASES   AND NOTHING DO YE SPEND IN THE LEAST  IN HIS CAUSE  BUT HE REPLACES IT   FOR HE IS THE BEST OF THOSE WHO GRANT SUSTENANCE 
   ONE DAY HE WILL GATHER THEM ALL TOGETHER  AND SAY TO THE ANGELS    WAS IT YOU THAT THESE MEN USED TO WORSHIP   
   THEY WILL SAY    GLORY TO THEE   OUR  TIE  IS WITH THEE  AS PROTECTOR NOT WITH THEM  NAY  BUT THEY WORSHIPPED THE JINNS   MOST OF THEM BELIEVED IN THEM  
   SO ON THAT DAY NO POWER SHALL THEY HAVE OVER EACH OTHER  FOR PROFIT OR HARM   AND WE SHALL SAY TO THE WRONG DOERS    TASTE YE THE PENALTY OF THE FIRE  THE WHICH YE WERE WONT TO DENY   
   WHEN OUR CLEAR SIGNS ARE REHEARSED TO THEM  THEY SAY    THIS IS ONLY A MAN WHO WISHES TO HINDER YOU FROM THE  WORSHIP  WHICH YOUR FATHERS PRACTICED   AND THEY SAY    THIS IS ONLY A FALSEHOOD INVENTED    AND THE UNBELIEVERS SAY OF THE TRUTH WHEN IT COMES TO THEM    THIS IS NOTHING BUT EVIDENT MAGIC   
   BUT WE HAD NOT GIVEN THEM BOOKS WHICH THEY COULD STUDY  NOR SENT APOSTLES TO THEM BEFORE THEE AS WARNERS 
   AND THEIR PREDECESSORS REJECTED  THE TRUTH    THESE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A TENTH OF WHAT WE HAD GRANTED TO THOSE   YET WHEN THEY REJECTED MY APOSTLES  HOW  TERRIBLE  WAS MY REJECTION  OF THEM   SECTION  
   SAY     I DO ADMONISH YOU ON ONE POINT   THAT YE DO STAND UP BEFORE GOD   IT MAY BE  IN PAIRS  OR  IT MAY BE  SINGLY   AND REFLECT  WITHIN YOURSELVES    YOUR COMPANION IS NOT POSSESSED   HE IS NO LESS THAN A WARNER TO YOU  IN FACE OF A TERRIBLE PENALTY  
   SAY     NO REWARD DO I ASK OF YOU   IT IS  ALL  IN YOUR INTEREST   MY REWARD IS ONLY DUE FROM GOD   AND HE IS WITNESS TO ALL THINGS  
   SAY     VERILY MY LORD DOTH CAST THE  MANTLE OF  TRUTH  OVER HIS SERVANTS    HE THAT HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF  ALL  THAT IS HIDDEN  
   SAY     THE TRUTH HAS ARRIVED  AND FALSEHOOD NEITHER CREATES ANYTHING NEW  NOR RESTORES ANYTHING  
   SAY     IF I AM ASTRAY  I ONLY STRAY TO THE LOSS OF MY OWN SOUL   BUT IF I RECEIVE GUIDANCE  IT IS BECAUSE OF THE INSPIRATION OF MY LORD TO ME   IT IS HE WHO HEARS ALL THINGS  AND IS  EVER  NEAR  
   IF THOU COULDST BUT SEE WHEN THEY WILL QUAKE WITH TERROR   BUT THEN THERE WILL BE NO ESCAPE  FOR THEM   AND THEY WILL BE SEIZED FROM A POSITION  QUITE  NEAR 
   AND THEY WILL SAY    WE DO BELIEVE  NOW  IN THE  TRUTH      BUT HOW COULD THEY RECEIVE  FAITH  FROM A POSITION  SO  FAR OFF  
   SEEING THAT THEY DID REJECT FAITH  ENTIRELY  BEFORE  AND THAT THEY  CONTINUALLY  CAST  SLANDERS  ON THE UNSEEN FROM A POSITION FAR OFF  
   AND BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR DESIRES  IS PLACED A BARRIER  AS WAS DONE IN THE PAST WITH THEIR PARTISANS   FOR THEY WERE INDEED IN SUSPICIOUS  DISQUIETING  DOUBT 
PRAISE BE TO GOD  WHO CREATED  OUT OF NOTHING  THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  WHO MADE THE ANGELS MESSENGERS WITH WINGS   TWO  OR THREE  OR FOUR  PAIRS    HE ADDS TO CREATION AS HE PLEASES   FOR GOD HAS POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   WHAT GOD OUT OF HIS MERCY DOTH BESTOW ON MANKIND THERE IS NONE CAN WITHHOLD   WHAT HE DOTH WITHHOLD  THERE IS NONE CAN GRANT  APART FROM HIM   AND HE IS THE EXALTED IN POWER  FULL OF WISDOM 
   O MEN  CALL TO MIND THE GRACE OF GOD UNTO YOU   IS THERE A CREATOR  OTHER THAN GOD  TO GIVE YOU SUSTENANCE FROM HEAVEN OR EARTH   THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE   HOW THEN ARE YE DELUDED AWAY FROM THE TRUTH  
   AND IF THEY REJECT THEE  SO WERE APOSTLES REJECTED BEFORE THEE   TO GOD GO BACK FOR DECISION ALL AFFAIRS 
   O MEN   CERTAINLY THE PROMISE OF GOD IS TRUE  LET NOT THEN THIS PRESENT LIFE DECEIVE YOU  NOR LET THE CHIEF DECEIVER DECEIVE YOU ABOUT GOD 
   VERILY SATAN IS AN ENEMY TO YOU   SO TREAT HIM AS AN ENEMY  HE ONLY INVITES HIS ADHERENTS  THAT THEY MAY BECOME COMPANIONS OF THE BLAZING FIRE 
   FOR THOSE WHO REJECT GOD  IS A TERRIBLE PENALTY   BUT FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  IS FORGIVENESS  AND A MAGNIFICENT REWARD SECTION  
   IS HE  THEN  TO WHOM THE EVIL OF HIS CONDUCT IS MADE ALLURING  SO THAT HE LOOKS UPON IT AS GOOD   EQUAL TO ONE WHO IS RIGHTLY GUIDED    FOR GOD LEAVES TO STRAY WHOM HE WILLS  AND GUIDES WHOM HE WILLS  SO LET NOT THY SOUL GO OUT IN  VAINLY  SIGHING AFTER THEM   FOR GOD KNOWS WELL ALL THAT THEY DO  
   IT IS GOD WHO SENDS FORTH THE WINDS  SO THAT THEY RAISE UP THE CLOUDS  AND WE DRIVE THEM TO A LAND THAT IS DEAD  AND REVIVE THE EARTH THEREWITH AFTER ITS DEATH   EVEN SO  WILL BE  THE RESURRECTION  
   IF ANY DO SEEK FOR GLORY AND POWER   TO GOD BELONG ALL GLORY AND POWER  TO HIM MOUNT UP  ALL  WORDS OF PURITY   IT IS HE WHO EXALTS EACH DEED OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  THOSE THAT LAY PLOTS OF EVIL   FOR THEM IS A PENALTY TERRIBLE   AND THE PLOTTING OF SUCH WILL BE VOID  OF RESULT  
   AND GOD DID CREATE YOU FROM DUST   THEN FROM A SPERM DROP   THEN HE MADE YOU IN PAIRS  AND NO FEMALE CONCEIVES  OR LAYS DOWN  HER LOAD   BUT WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE  NOR IS A MAN LONG LIVED GRANTED LENGTH OF DAYS  NOR IS A PART CUT OFF FROM HIS LIFE  BUT IS IN A DECREE  ORDAINED   ALL THIS IS EASY TO GOD 
   NOR ARE THE TWO BODIES OF FLOWING WATER ALIKE   THE ONE PALATABLE  SWEET  AND PLEASANT TO DRINK  AND THE OTHER  SALT AND BITTER  YET FROM EACH  KIND OF WATER  DO YE EAT FLESH FRESH AND TENDER  AND YE EXTRACT ORNAMENTS TO WEAR   AND THOU SEEST THE SHIPS THEREIN THAT PLOUGH THE WAVES  THAT YE MAY SEEK  THUS  OF THE BOUNTY OF GOD THAT YE MAY BE GRATEFUL 
   HE MERGES NIGHT INTO DAY  AND HE MERGES DAY INTO NIGHT  AND HE HAS SUBJECTED THE SUN AND THE MOON  TO HIS LAW    EACH ONE RUNS ITS COURSE FOR A TERM APPOINTED  SUCH IS GOD YOUR LORD   TO HIM BELONGS ALL DOMINION  AND THOSE WHOM YE INVOKE BESIDES HIM HAVE NOT THE LEAST POWER 
   IF YE INVOKE THEM  THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOUR CALL  AND IF THEY WERE TO LISTEN  THEY CANNOT ANSWER YOUR  PRAYER   ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT THEY WILL REJECT YOUR  PARTNERSHIP   AND NONE   O MAN    CAN TELL THEE  THE TRUTH  LIKE THE ONE WHO IS ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THINGS SECTION  
   O YE MEN   IT IS YE THAT HAVE NEED OF GOD   BUT GOD IS THE ONE FREE OF ALL WANTS  WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE 
   IF HE SO PLEASED  HE COULD BLOT YOU OUT AND BRING IN A NEW CREATION  
   NOR IS THAT  AT ALL  DIFFICULT FOR GOD 
   NOR CAN A BEARER OF BURDENS BEAR ANOTHER S BURDEN  IF ONE HEAVILY LADEN SHOULD CALL ANOTHER TO  BEAR  HIS LOAD  NOT THE LEAST PORTION OF IT CAN BE CARRIED  BY THE OTHER   EVEN THOUGH HE BE NEARLY RELATED  THOU CANST BUT ADMONISH SUCH AS FEAR THEIR LORD UNSEEN AND ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER  AND WHOEVER PURIFIES HIMSELF DOES SO FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS OWN SOUL   AND THE DESTINATION  OF ALL  IS TO GOD 
   THE BLIND AND THE SEEING ARE NOT ALIKE  
   NOR ARE THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS AND THE LIGHT  
   NOR ARE THE  CHILLY  SHADE AND THE  GENIAL  HEAT OF THE SUN  
   NOR ARE ALIKE THOSE THAT ARE LIVING AND THOSE THAT ARE DEAD  GOD CAN MAKE ANY THAT HE WILLS TO HEAR   BUT THOU CANST NOT MAKE THOSE TO HEAR WHO ARE  BURIED  IN GRAVES 
   THOU ART NO OTHER THAN A WARNER 
   VERILY WE HAVE SENT THEE IN TRUTH  AS A BEARER OF GLAD TIDINGS  AND AS A WARNER   AND THERE NEVER WAS A PEOPLE  WITHOUT A WARNER HAVING LIVED AMONG THEM  IN THE PAST  
   AND IF THEY REJECT THEE  SO DID THEIR PREDECESSORS  TO WHOM CAME THEIR APOSTLES WITH CLEAR SIGNS  BOOKS OF DARK PROPHECIES  AND THE BOOK OF ENLIGHTENMENT 
   IN THE END DID I PUNISH THOSE WHO REJECTED FAITH   AND HOW  TERRIBLE  WAS MY REJECTION  OF THEM   SECTION  
   SEEST THOU NOT THAT GOD SENDS DOWN RAIN FROM THE SKY   WITH IT WE THEN BRING OUT PRODUCE OF VARIOUS COLOURS  AND IN THE MOUNTAINS ARE TRACTS WHITE AND RED  OF VARIOUS SHADES OF COLOUR  AND BLACK INTENSE IN HUE 
   AND SO AMONGST MEN AND CRAWLING CREATURES AND CATTLE  ARE THEY OF VARIOUS COLOURS  THOSE TRULY FEAR GOD  AMONG HIS SERVANTS  WHO HAVE KNOWLEDGE   FOR GOD IS EXALTED IN MIGHT  OFT FORGIVING 
   THOSE WHO REHEARSE THE BOOK OF GOD  ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER  AND SPEND  IN CHARITY  OUT OF WHAT WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR THEM  SECRETLY AND OPENLY  HOPE FOR A COMMERCE THAT WILL NEVER FAIL  
   FOR HE WILL PAY THEM THEIR MEED  NAY  HE WILL GIVE THEM  EVEN  MORE OUT OF HIS BOUNTY   FOR HE IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST READY TO APPRECIATE  SERVICE  
   THAT WHICH WE HAVE REVEALED TO THEE OF THE BOOK IS THE TRUTH   CONFIRMING WHAT WAS  REVEALED  BEFORE IT   FOR GOD IS ASSUREDLY  WITH RESPECT TO HIS SERVANTS  WELL ACQUAINTED AND FULLY OBSERVANT 
   THEN WE HAVE GIVEN THE BOOK FOR INHERITANCE TO SUCH OF OUR SERVANTS AS WE HAVE CHOSEN   BUT THERE ARE AMONG THEM SOME WHO WRONG THEIR OWN SOULS   SOME WHO FOLLOW A MIDDLE COURSE   AND SOME WHO ARE BY GOD S LEAVE FOREMOST IN GOOD DEEDS   THAT IS THE HIGHEST GRACE 
   GARDENS OF ETERNITY WILL THEY ENTER   THEREIN WILL THEY BE ADORNED WITH BRACELETS OF GOLD AND PEARLS   AND THEIR GARMENTS THERE WILL BE OF SILK 
   AND THEY WILL SAY     PRAISE BE TO GOD  WHO HAS REMOVED FROM US  ALL  SORROW   FOR OUR LORD IS INDEED OFT FORGIVING READY TO APPRECIATE  SERVICE   
     WHO HAS  OUT OF HIS BOUNTY  SETTLED US IN A HOME THAT WILL LAST   NO TOIL NOR SENSE OF WEARINESS SHALL TOUCH US THEREIN  
   BUT THOSE WHO REJECT  GOD   FOR THEM WILL BE THE FIRE OF HELL   NO TERM SHALL BE DETERMINED FOR THEM  SO THEY SHOULD DIE  NOR SHALL ITS PENALTY BE LIGHTENED FOR THEM  THUS DO WE REWARD EVERY UNGRATEFUL ONE  
   THEREIN WILL THEY CRY ALOUD  FOR ASSISTANCE      OUR LORD   BRING US OUT   WE SHALL WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS  NOT THE  DEEDS  WE USED TO DO       DID WE NOT GIVE YOU LONG ENOUGH LIFE SO THAT HE THAT WOULD SHOULD RECEIVE ADMONITION   AND  MOREOVER  THE WARNER CAME TO YOU  SO TASTE YE  THE FRUIT OF YOUR DEEDS    FOR THE WRONG DOERS THERE IS NO HELPER  SECTION  
   VERILY GOD KNOWS  ALL  THE HIDDEN THINGS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   VERILY HE HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THAT IS IN  MEN S  HEARTS 
   HE IT IS THAT HAS MADE YOU INHERITORS IN THE EARTH   IF  THEN  ANY DO REJECT  GOD   THEIR REJECTION  WORKS  AGAINST THEMSELVES   THEIR REJECTION BUT ADDS TO THE ODIUM FOR THE UNBELIEVERS IN THE SIGHT OF THEIR LORD   THEIR REJECTION BUT ADDS TO  THEIR OWN  UNDOING 
   SAY     HAVE YE SEEN  THESE    PARTNERS   OF YOURS WHOM YE CALL UPON BESIDES GOD     SHOW ME WHAT IT IS THEY HAVE CREATED IN THE  WIDE  EARTH  OR HAVE THEY A SHARE IN THE HEAVENS   OR HAVE WE GIVEN THEM A BOOK FROM WHICH THEY  CAN DERIVE  CLEAR  EVIDENCE    NAY  THE WRONG DOERS PROMISE EACH OTHER NOTHING BUT DELUSIONS 
   IT IS GOD WHO SUSTAINS THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  LEST THEY CEASE  TO FUNCTION    AND IF THEY SHOULD FAIL  THERE IS NONE NOT ONE  CAN SUSTAIN THEM THEREAFTER   VERILY HE IS MOST FORBEARING  OFT FORGIVING 
   THEY SWORE THEIR STRONGEST OATHS BY GOD THAT IF A WARNER CAME TO THEM  THEY WOULD FOLLOW HIS GUIDANCE BETTER THAN ANY  OTHER  OF THE PEOPLES   BUT WHEN A WARNER CAME TO THEM  IT HAS ONLY INCREASED THEIR FLIGHT  FROM RIGHTEOUSNESS   
   ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR ARROGANCE IN THE LAND AND THEIR PLOTTING OF EVIL  BUT THE PLOTTING OF EVIL WILL HEM IN ONLY THE AUTHORS THEREOF  NOW ARE THEY BUT LOOKING FOR THE WAY THE ANCIENTS WERE DEALT WITH   BUT NO CHANGE WILT THOU FIND IN GOD S WAY  OF DEALING    NO TURNING OFF WILT THOU FIND IN GOD S WAY  OF DEALING  
   DO THEY NOT TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH  AND SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE BEFORE THEM   THOUGH THEY WERE SUPERIOR TO THEM IN STRENGTH   NOR IS GOD TO BE FRUSTRATED BY ANYTHING WHATEVER IN THE HEAVENS OR ON EARTH   FOR HE IS ALL KNOWING  ALL POWERFUL 
   IF GOD WERE TO PUNISH MEN ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY DESERVE  HE WOULD NOT LEAVE ON THE BACK OF THE  EARTH  A SINGLE LIVING CREATURE   BUT HE GIVES THEM RESPITE FOR A STATED TERM   WHEN THEIR TERM EXPIRES  VERILY GOD HAS IN HIS SIGHT ALL HIS SERVANTS 
   YA SIN 
   BY THE QUR ĀN  FULL OF WISDOM  
   THOU ART INDEED ONE OF THE APOSTLES 
   ON A STRAIGHT WAY 
   IT IS A REVELATION SENT DOWN BY  HIM  THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  MOST MERCIFUL 
   IN ORDER THAT THOU MAYEST ADMONISH A PEOPLE  WHOSE FATHERS HAD RECEIVED NO ADMONITION  AND WHO THEREFORE REMAIN HEEDLESS  OF THE SIGNS OF GOD  
   THE WORD IS PROVED TRUE AGAINST THE GREATER PART OF THEM   FOR THEY DO NOT BELIEVE 
   WE HAVE PUT YOKES ROUND THEIR NECKS RIGHT UP TO THEIR CHINS  SO THAT THEIR HEADS ARE FORCED UP  AND THEY CANNOT SEE  
   AND WE HAVE PUT A BAR IN FRONT OF THEM AND A BAR BEHIND THEM  AND FURTHER  WE HAVE COVERED THEM UP   SO THAT THEY CANNOT SEE 
   THE SAME IS IT TO THEM WHETHER THOU ADMONISH THEM OR THOU DO NOT ADMONISH THEM   THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE 
   THOU CANST BUT ADMONISH SUCH A ONE AS FOLLOWS THE MESSAGE AND FEARS THE  LORD  MOST GRACIOUS  UNSEEN   GIVE SUCH A ONE  THEREFORE  GOOD TIDINGS  OF FORGIVENESS AND A REWARD MOST GENEROUS 
   VERILY WE SHALL GIVE LIFE TO THE DEAD  AND WE RECORD THAT WHICH THEY SEND BEFORE AND THAT WHICH THEY LEAVE BEHIND  AND OF ALL THINGS HAVE WE TAKEN ACCOUNT IN A CLEAR BOOK  OF EVIDENCE  SECTION  
   SET FORTH TO THEM  BY WAY OF A PARABLE  THE  STORY OF  THE COMPANIONS OF THE CITY  BEHOLD  THERE CAME APOSTLES TO IT 
   WHEN WE  FIRST  SENT TO THEM TWO APOSTLES  THEY REJECTED THEM   BUT WE STRENGTHENED THEM WITH A THIRD   THEY SAID    TRULY  WE HAVE BEEN SENT ON A MISSION TO YOU  
   THE  PEOPLE  SAID     YE ARE ONLY MEN LIKE OURSELVES   AND  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS SENDS NO SORT OF REVELATION   YE DO NOTHING BUT LIE  
   THEY SAID     OUR LORD DOTH KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN SENT ON A MISSION TO YOU  
     AND OUR DUTY IS ONLY TO PROCLAIM THE CLEAR MESSAGE  
   THE  PEOPLE  SAID     FOR US  WE AUGUR AN EVIL OMEN FROM YOU   IF YE DESIST NOT  WE WILL CERTAINLY STONE YOU  AND A GRIEVOUS PUNISHMENT INDEED WILL BE INFLICTED ON YOU BY US  
   THEY SAID     YOUR EVIL OMENS ARE WITH YOURSELVES    DEEM YE THIS AN EVIL OMEN   IF YE ARE ADMONISHED   NAY  BUT YE ARE A PEOPLE TRANSGRESSING ALL BOUNDS  
   THEN THERE CAME RUNNING  FROM THE FARTHEST PART OF THE CITY  A MAN  SAYING    O MY PEOPLE  OBEY THE APOSTLES  
     OBEY THOSE WHO ASK NO REWARD OF YOU  FOR THEMSELVES   AND WHO HAVE THEMSELVES RECEIVED GUIDANCE 
     IT WOULD NOT BE REASONABLE IN ME IF I DID NOT SERVE HIM WHO CREATED ME  AND TO WHOM YE SHALL  ALL  BE BROUGHT BACK 
     SHALL I TAKE  OTHER  GODS BESIDES HIM   IF  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS SHOULD INTEND SOME ADVERSITY FOR ME  OF NO USE WHATEVER WILL BE THEIR INTERCESSION FOR ME NOR  CAN THEY DELIVER ME 
     I WOULD INDEED  IF I WERE TO DO SO  BE IN MANIFEST ERROR 
     FOR ME  I HAVE FAITH IN THE LORD OF YOU  ALL    LISTEN  THEN  TO ME   
   IT WAS SAID     ENTER THOU THE GARDEN   HE SAID     AH ME   WOULD THAT MY PEOPLE KNEW  WHAT I KNOW    
     FOR THAT MY LORD HAS GRANTED ME FORGIVENESS AND HAS ENROLLED ME AMONG THOSE HELD IN HONOUR   
   AND WE SENT NOT DOWN AGAINST HIS PEOPLE  AFTER HIM  ANY HOSTS FROM HEAVEN  NOR WAS IT NEEDFUL FOR US SO TO DO 
   IT WAS NO MORE THAN A SINGLE MIGHTY BLAST  AND BEHOLD   THEY WERE  LIKE ASHES  QUENCHED AND SILENT 
   AH   ALAS FOR  MY  SERVANTS   THERE COMES NOT AN APOSTLE TO THEM BUT THEY MOCK HIM  
   SEE THEY NOT HOW MANY GENERATIONS BEFORE THEM WE DESTROYED   NOT TO THEM WILL THEY RETURN  
   BUT EACH ONE OF THEM ALL WILL BE BROUGHT BEFORE US  FOR JUDGMENT  SECTION  
   A SIGN FOR THEM IS THE EARTH THAT IS DEAD   WE DO GIVE IT LIFE  AND PRODUCE GRAIN THEREFROM  OF WHICH YE DO EAT 
   AND WE PRODUCE THEREIN ORCHARDS WITH DATE PALMS AND VINES  AND WE CAUSE SPRINGS TO GUSH FORTH THEREIN  
   THAT THEY MAY ENJOY THE FRUITS OF THIS  ARTISTRY    IT WAS NOT THEIR HANDS THAT MADE THIS   WILL THEY NOT THEN GIVE THANKS  
   GLORY TO GOD  WHO CREATED IN PAIRS ALL THINGS THAT THE EARTH PRODUCES  AS WELL AS THEIR OWN  HUMAN  KIND AND  OTHER  THINGS OF WHICH THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE 
   AND A SIGN FOR THEM IS THE NIGHT   WE WITHDRAW THEREFROM THE DAY  AND BEHOLD THEY ARE PLUNGED IN DARKNESS  
   AND THE SUN RUNS HIS COURSE FOR A PERIOD DETERMINED FOR HIM   THAT IS THE DECREE OF  HIM  THE EXALTED IN MIGHT THE ALL KNOWING 
   AND THE MOON   WE HAVE MEASURED FOR HER MANSIONS  TO TRAVERSE  TILL SHE RETURNS LIKE THE OLD  AND WITHERED  LOWER PART OF A DATE STALK 
   IT IS NOT PERMITTED TO THE SUN TO CATCH UP THE MOON  NOR CAN THE NIGHT OUTSTRIP THE DAY   EACH  JUST  SWIMS ALONG IN  ITS OWN  ORBIT  ACCORDING TO LAW  
   AND A SIGN FOR THEM IS THAT WE BORE THEIR RACE  THROUGH THE FLOOD  IN THE LOADED ARK  
   AND WE HAVE CREATED FOR THEM SIMILAR  VESSELS  ON WHICH THEY RIDE 
   IF IT WERE OUR WILL  WE COULD DROWN THEM   THEN WOULD THERE BE NO HELPER  TO HEAR THEIR CRY   NOR COULD THEY BE DELIVERED 
   EXCEPT BY WAY OF MERCY FROM US  AND BY WAY OF  WORLDLY  CONVENIENCE  TO SERVE THEM  FOR A TIME 
   WHEN THEY ARE TOLD    FEAR YE THAT WHICH IS BEFORE YOU AND THAT WHICH WILL BE AFTER YOU  IN ORDER THAT YE MAY RECEIVE MERCY    THEY TURN BACK  
   NOT A SIGN COMES TO THEM FROM AMONG THE SIGNS OF THEIR LORD  BUT THEY TURN AWAY THEREFROM 
   AND WHEN THEY ARE TOLD    SPEND YE OF  THE BOUNTIES  WITH WHICH GOD HAS PROVIDED YOU   THE UNBELIEVERS SAY TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE     SHALL WE THEN FEED THOSE WHOM  IF GOD HAD SO WILLED  HE WOULD HAVE FED   HIMSELF     YE ARE IN NOTHING BUT MANIFEST ERROR  
   FURTHER  THEY SAY    WHEN WILL THIS PROMISE  COME TO PASS   IF WHAT YE SAY IS TRUE   
   THEY WILL NOT  HAVE TO  WAIT FOR AUGHT BUT A SINGLE BLAST   IT WILL SEIZE THEM WHILE THEY ARE YET DISPUTING AMONG THEMSELVES  
   NO  CHANCE  WILL THEY THEN HAVE  BY WILL  TO DISPOSE  OF THEIR AFFAIRS   NOR TO RETURN TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE  SECTION  
   THE TRUMPET SHALL BE SOUNDED  WHEN BEHOLD   FROM THE SEPULCHRES  MEN  WILL RUSH FORTH TO THEIR LORD  
   THEY WILL SAY     AH   WOE UNTO US   WHO HATH RAISED US UP FROM OUR BEDS OF REPOSE      A VOICE WILL SAY &COLON     THIS IS WHAT  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS HAD PROMISED  AND TRUE WAS THE WORD OF THE APOSTLES   
   IT WILL BE NO MORE THAN A SINGLE BLAST  WHEN LO   THEY WILL ALL BE BROUGHT UP BEFORE US  
   THEN  ON THAT DAY  NOT A SOUL WILL BE WRONGED IN THE LEAST  AND YE SHALL BUT BE REPAID THE MEEDS OF YOUR PAST DEEDS 
   VERILY THE COMPANIONS OF THE GARDEN SHALL THAT DAY HAVE JOY IN ALL THAT THEY DO  
   THEY AND THEIR ASSOCIATES WILL BE IN GROVES OF  COOL  SHADE  RECLINING ON THRONES  OF DIGNITY   
    EVERY  FRUIT  ENJOYMENT  WILL BE THERE FOR THEM   THEY SHALL HAVE WHATEVER THEY CALL FOR  
     PEACE    A WORD  OF SALUTATION  FROM A LORD MOST MERCIFUL  
     AND O YE IN SIN   GET YE APART THIS DAY  
     DID I NOT ENJOIN ON YOU  O YE CHILDREN OF ADAM  THAT YE SHOULD NOT WORSHIP SATAN   FOR THAT HE WAS TO YOU AN ENEMY AVOWED   
     AND THAT YE SHOULD WORSHIP ME   FOR THAT  THIS WAS THE STRAIGHT WAY  
     BUT HE DID LEAD ASTRAY A GREAT MULTITUDE OF YOU  DID YE NOT  THEN  UNDERSTAND  
     THIS IS THE HELL OF WHICH YE WERE  REPEATEDLY  WARNED  
     EMBRACE YE THE  FIRE  THIS DAY  FOR THAT YE  PERSISTENTLY  REJECTED  TRUTH   
   THAT DAY SHALL WE SET A SEAL ON THEIR MOUTHS  BUT THEIR HANDS WILL SPEAK TO US  AND THEIR FEET BEAR WITNESS  TO ALL THAT THEY DID 
   IF IT HAD BEEN OUR WILL  WE COULD SURELY HAVE BLOTTED  OUT THEIR EYES   THEN SHOULD THEY HAVE RUN ABOUT GROPING FOR THE PATH  BUT HOW COULD THEY HAVE SEEN  
   AND IF IT HAD BEEN OUR WILL  WE COULD HAVE TRANSFORMED THEM  TO REMAIN  IN THEIR PLACES   THEN SHOULD THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO MOVE ABOUT  NOR COULD THEY HAVE RETURNED  AFTER ERROR  SECTION  
   IF WE GRANT LONG LIFE TO ANY  WE CAUSE HIM TO BE REVERSED IN NATURE   WILL THEY NOT THEN UNDERSTAND  
   WE HAVE NOT INSTRUCTED THE  PROPHET  IN POETRY  NOR IS IT MEET FOR HIM   THIS IS NO LESS THAN A MESSAGE AND A QUR ĀN MAKING THINGS CLEAR  
   THAT IT MAY GIVE ADMONITION TO ANY  WHO ARE  ALIVE  AND THAT THE CHARGE MAY BE PROVED AGAINST THOSE WHO REJECT  TRUTH  
   SEE THEY NOT THAT IT IS WE WHO HAVE CREATED FOR THEM AMONG THE THINGS WHICH OUR HANDS HAVE FASHIONED CATTLE  WHICH ARE UNDER THEIR DOMINION   
   AND THAT WE HAVE SUBJECTED THEM TO THEIR  USE    OF THEM SOME DO CARRY THEM AND SOME THEY EAT  
   AND THEY HAVE  OTHER  PROFITS FROM THEM  BESIDES   AND THEY GET  MILK  TO DRINK  WILL THEY NOT THEN BE GRATEFUL  
   YET THEY TAKE  FOR WORSHIP  GODS OTHER THAN GOD   HOPING  THAT THEY MIGHT BE HELPED  
   THEY HAVE NOT THE POWER TO HELP THEM   BUT THEY WILL BE BROUGHT UP  BEFORE OUR JUDGMENT SEAT  AS A TROOP  TO BE CONDEMNED  
   LET NOT THEIR SPEECH  THEN  GRIEVE THEE  VERILY WE KNOW WHAT THEY HIDE AS WELL AS WHAT THEY DISCLOSE 
   DOTH NOT MAN SEE THAT IT IS WE WHO CREATED HIM FROM SPERM   YET BEHOLD   HE  STANDS FORTH  AS AN OPEN ADVERSARY  
   AND HE MAKES COMPARISONS FOR US  AND FORGETS HIS OWN  ORIGIN AND  CREATION   HE SAYS    WHO CAN GIVE LIFE TO  DRY  BONES AND DECOMPOSED ONES  AT THAT    
   SAY    HE WILL GIVE THEM LIFE WHO CREATED THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME   FOR HE IS WELL VERSED IN EVERY KIND OF CREATION   
     THE SAME WHO PRODUCES FOR YOU FIRE OUT OF THE GREEN TREE  WHEN BEHOLD   YE KINDLE THEREWITH  YOUR OWN FIRES   
     IS NOT HE WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH ABLE TO CREATE THE LIKE THEREOF    YEA  INDEED   FOR HE IS THE CREATOR SUPREME  OF SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE  INFINITE   
   VERILY  WHEN HE INTENDS A THING  HIS COMMAND IS    BE    AND IT IS  
   SO GLORY TO HIM IN WHOSE HANDS IS THE DOMINION OF ALL THINGS   AND TO HIM WILL YE BE ALL BROUGHT BACK 
   BY THOSE WHO RANGE THEMSELVES IN RANKS 
   AND SO ARE STRONG IN REPELLING  EVIL  
   AND THUS PROCLAIM THE MESSAGE  OF GOD   
   VERILY  VERILY  YOUR GOD IS ONE   
   LORD OF THE HEAVENS AND OF THE EARTH  AND ALL BETWEEN THEM  AND LORD OF EVERY POINT AT THE RISING OF THE SUN  
   WE HAVE INDEED DECKED THE LOWER HEAVEN WITH BEAUTY  IN  THE STARS  
    FOR BEAUTY  AND FOR GUARD AGAINST ALL OBSTINATE REBELLIOUS EVIL SPIRITS 
    SO  THEY SHOULD NOT STRAIN THEIR EARS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE EXALTED ASSEMBLY BUT BE CAST AWAY FROM EVERY SIDE 
   REPULSED  FOR THEY ARE UNDER A PERPETUAL PENALTY 
   EXCEPT SUCH AS SNATCH AWAY SOMETHING BY STEALTH  AND THEY ARE PURSUED BY A FLAMING FIRE  OF PIERCING BRIGHTNESS 
   JUST ASK THEIR OPINION   ARE THEY THE MORE DIFFICULT TO CREATE  OR THE  OTHER  BEINGS WE HAVE CREATED   THEM HAVE WE CREATED OUT OF A STICKY CLAY  
   TRULY DOST THOU MARVEL  WHILE THEY RIDICULE 
   AND  WHEN THEY ARE ADMONISHED  PAY NO HEED  
   AND  WHEN THEY SEE A SIGN  TURN IT TO MOCKERY 
   AND SAY    THIS IS NOTHING BUT EVIDENT SORCERY  
     WHAT   WHEN WE DIE  AND BECOME DUST AND BONES  SHALL WE  THEN  BE RAISED UP  AGAIN   
     AND ALSO OUR FATHERS OF OLD   
   SAY THOU     YEA  AND YE SHALL THEN BE HUMILIATED  ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR EVIL   
   THEN IT WILL BE A SINGLE  COMPELLING  CRY   AND BEHOLD  THEY WILL BEGIN TO SEE  
   THEY WILL SAY    AH   WOE TO US   THIS IS THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT   
    A VOICE WILL SAY     THIS IS THE DAY OF SORTING OUT  WHOSE TRUTH YE  ONCE  DENIED   SECTION  
     BRING YE UP   IT SHALL BE SAID    THE WRONG DOERS AND THEIR WIVES  AND THE THINGS THEY WORSHIPPED 
     BESIDES GOD  AND LEAD THEM TO THE WAY TO THE  FIERCE  FIRE  
     BUT STOP THEM  FOR THEY MUST BE ASKED  
       WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU THAT YE HELP NOT EACH OTHER      
   NAY  BUT THAT DAY THEY SHALL SUBMIT  TO JUDGMENT   
   AND THEY WILL TURN TO ONE ANOTHER  AND QUESTION ONE ANOTHER 
   THEY WILL SAY     IT WAS YE WHO USED TO COME TO US FROM THE RIGHT HAND  OF POWER AND AUTHORITY    
   THEY WILL REPLY     NAY  YE YOURSELVES HAD NO FAITH  
     NOR HAD WE ANY AUTHORITY OVER YOU  NAY  IT WAS YE WHO WERE A PEOPLE IN OBSTINATE REBELLION  
     SO NOW HAS BEEN PROVED TRUE  AGAINST US  THE WORD OF OUR LORD THAT WE SHALL INDEED  HAVE TO  TASTE  THE PUNISHMENT OF OUR SINS  
     WE LED YOU ASTRAY   FOR TRULY WE WERE OURSELVES ASTRAY  
   TRULY  THAT DAY  THEY WILL  ALL  SHARE IN THE PENALTY 
   VERILY THAT IS HOW WE SHALL DEAL WITH SINNERS 
   FOR THEY  WHEN THEY WERE TOLD THAT THERE IS NO GOD EXCEPT GOD  WOULD PUFF THEMSELVES UP WITH PRIDE 
   AND SAY     WHAT   SHALL WE GIVE UP OUR GODS  FOR THE SAKE OF A POET POSSESSED   
   NAY   HE HAS COME WITH THE  VERY  TRUTH  AND HE CONFIRMS  THE MESSAGE OF  THE APOSTLES  BEFORE HIM  
   YE SHALL INDEED TASTE OF THE GRIEVOUS PENALTY   
   BUT IT WILL BE NO MORE THAN THE RETRIBUTION OF  THE EVIL  THAT YE HAVE WROUGHT   
   BUT THE SINCERE  AND DEVOTED  SERVANTS OF GOD  
   FOR THEM IS A SUSTENANCE DETERMINED 
   FRUITS  DELIGHTS    AND THEY  SHALL ENJOY  HONOUR AND DIGNITY 
   IN GARDENS OF FELICITY 
   FACING EACH OTHER ON THRONES  OF DIGNITY   
   ROUND WILL BE PASSED TO THEM A CUP FROM A CLEAR FLOWING FOUNTAIN 
   CRYSTAL WHITE  OF A TASTE DELICIOUS TO THOSE WHO DRINK  THEREOF  
   FREE FROM HEADINESS   NOR WILL THEY SUFFER INTOXICATION THEREFROM 
   AND BESIDES THEM WILL BE CHASTE WOMEN  RESTRAINING THEIR GLANCES  WITH BIG EYES  OF WONDER AND BEAUTY  
   AS IF THEY WERE  DELICATE  EGGS CLOSELY GUARDED 
   THEN THEY WILL TURN TO ONE ANOTHER AND QUESTION ONE ANOTHER 
   ONE OF THEM WILL START THE TALK AND SAY     I HAD AN INTIMATE COMPANION  ON THE EARTH  
     WHO USED TO SAY    WHAT   ART THOU AMONGST THOSE WHO BEAR WITNESS TO THE TRUTH  OF THE MESSAGE   
       WHEN WE DIE AND BECOME DUST AND BONES  SHALL WE INDEED RECEIVE REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS      
    A VOICE  SAID     WOULD YE LIKE TO LOOK DOWN   
   HE LOOKED DOWN AND SAW HIM IN THE MIDST OF THE FIRE 
   HE SAID     BY GOD   THOU WAST LITTLE SHORT OF BRINGING ME TO PERDITION  
     HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE GRACE OF MY LORD  I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN AMONG THOSE BROUGHT  THERE   
     IS IT  THE CASE  THAT WE SHALL NOT DIE 
     EXCEPT OUR FIRST DEATH  AND THAT WE SHALL NOT BE PUNISHED   
   VERILY THIS IS THE SUPREME ACHIEVEMENT  
   FOR THE LIKE OF THIS LET ALL STRIVE  WHO WISH TO STRIVE 
   IS THAT THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OR THE TREE OF ZAQQŪM  
   FOR WE HAVE TRULY MADE IT  AS  A TRIAL FOR THE WRONG DOERS 
   FOR IT IS A TREE THAT SPRINGS OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF HELL FIRE  
   THE SHOOTS OF ITS FRUIT STALKS ARE LIKE THE HEADS OF DEVILS  
   TRULY THEY WILL EAT THEREOF AND FILL THEIR BELLIES THEREWITH 
   THEN ON TOP OF THAT THEY WILL BE GIVEN A MIXTURE MADE OF BOILING WATER 
   THEN SHALL THEIR RETURN BE TO THE  BLAZING  FIRE 
   TRULY THEY FOUND THEIR FATHERS ON THE WRONG PATH  
   SO THEY  TOO  WERE RUSHED DOWN ON THEIR FOOTSTEPS  
   AND TRULY BEFORE THEM  MANY OF THE ANCIENTS WENT ASTRAY   
   BUT WE SENT AFORETIME  AMONG THEM   APOSTLES  TO ADMONISH THEM   
   THEN SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE WHO WERE ADMONISHED  BUT HEEDED NOT   
   EXCEPT THE SINCERE  AND DEVOTED  SERVANTS OF GOD SECTION  
    IN THE DAYS OF OLD   NOAH CRIED TO US  AND WE ARE THE BEST TO HEAR PRAYER 
   AND WE DELIVERED HIM AND HIS PEOPLE FROM THE GREAT CALAMITY 
   AND MADE HIS PROGENY TO ENDURE  ON THIS EARTH   
   AND WE LEFT  THIS BLESSING  FOR HIM AMONG GENERATIONS TO COME IN LATER TIMES  
     PEACE AND SALUTATION TO NOAH AMONG THE NATIONS   
   THUS INDEED DO WE REWARD THOSE WHO DO RIGHT 
   FOR HE WAS ONE OF OUR BELIEVING SERVANTS 
   THEN THE REST WE OVERWHELMED IN THE FLOOD 
   VERILY AMONG THOSE WHO FOLLOWED HIS WAY WAS ABRAHAM 
   BEHOLD  HE APPROACHED HIS LORD WITH A SOUND HEART 
   BEHOLD  HE SAID TO HIS FATHER AND TO HIS PEOPLE    WHAT IS THAT WHICH YE WORSHIP  
     IS IT A FALSEHOOD  GODS OTHER THAN GOD  THAT YE DESIRE  
     THEN WHAT IS YOUR IDEA ABOUT THE LORD OF THE WORLDS   
   THEN DID HE CAST A GLANCE AT THE STAR 
   AND HE SAID    I AM INDEED SICK  AT HEART    
   SO THEY TURNED AWAY FROM HIM  AND DEPARTED 
   THEN DID HE TURN TO THEIR GODS AND SAID    WILL YE NOT EAT  OF THE OFFERINGS BEFORE YOU    
     WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU THAT YE SPEAK NOT  INTELLIGENTLY    
   THEN DID HE TURN UPON THEM  STRIKING  THEM  WITH THE RIGHT HAND 
   THEN CAME  THE WORSHIPPERS  WITH HURRIED STEPS  AND FACED  HIM  
   HE SAID     WORSHIP YE THAT WHICH YE HAVE  YOURSELVES  CARVED  
     BUT GOD HAS CREATED YOU AND YOUR HANDIWORK   
   THEY SAID    BUILD HIM A FURNACE  AND THROW HIM INTO THE BLAZING FIRE   
    THIS FAILING   THEY THEN SOUGHT A STRATAGEM AGAINST HIM  BUT WE MADE THEM THE ONES MOST HUMILIATED  
   HE SAID     I WILL GO TO MY LORD   HE WILL SURELY GUIDE ME  
     O MY LORD   GRANT ME A RIGHTEOUS  SON    
   SO WE GAVE HIM THE GOOD NEWS OF A BOY READY TO SUFFER AND FORBEAR 
   THEN  WHEN  THE SON  REACHED  THE AGE OF   SERIOUS  WORK WITH HIM  HE SAID     O MY SON   I SEE IN VISION THAT I OFFER THEE IN SACRIFICE   NOW SEE WHAT IS THY VIEW     THE SON  SAID     O MY FATHER   DO AS THOU ART COMMANDED   THOU WILL FIND ME  IF GOD SO WILLS ONE PRACTICING PATIENCE AND CONSTANCY   
   SO WHEN THEY HAD BOTH SUBMITTED THEIR WILLS  TO GOD   AND HE HAD LAID HIM PROSTRATE ON HIS FOREHEAD  FOR SACRIFICE  
   WE CALLED OUT TO HIM    O ABRAHAM  
     THOU HAST ALREADY FULFILLED THE VISION    THUS INDEED DO WE REWARD THOSE WHO DO RIGHT 
   FOR THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY A TRIAL 
   AND WE RANSOMED HIM WITH A MOMENTOUS SACRIFICE  
   AND WE LEFT  THIS BLESSING  FOR HIM AMONG GENERATIONS  TO COME  IN LATER TIMES  
     PEACE AND SALUTATION TO ABRAHAM   
   THUS INDEED DO WE REWARD THOSE WHO DO RIGHT 
   FOR HE WAS ONE OF OUR BELIEVING SERVANTS 
   AND WE GAVE HIM THE GOOD NEWS OF ISAAC A PROPHET   ONE OF THE RIGHTEOUS 
   WE BLESSED HIM AND ISAAC   BUT OF THEIR PROGENY ARE  SOME  THAT DO RIGHT  AND  SOME  THAT OBVIOUSLY DO WRONG  TO THEIR OWN SOULS SECTION  
   AGAIN   OF OLD   WE BESTOWED OUR FAVOUR ON MOSES AND AARON 
   AND WE DELIVERED THEM AND THEIR PEOPLE FROM  THEIR  GREAT CALAMITY  
   AND WE HELPED THEM  SO THEY OVERCAME  THEIR TROUBLES   
   AND WE GAVE THEM THE BOOK WHICH HELPS TO MAKE THINGS CLEAR  
   AND WE GUIDED THEM TO THE STRAIGHT WAY 
   AND WE LEFT  THIS BLESSING  FOR THEM AMONG GENERATIONS  TO COME  IN LATER TIMES  
     PEACE AND SALUTATION TO MOSES AND AARON   
   THUS INDEED DO WE REWARD THOSE WHO DO RIGHT 
   FOR THEY WERE TWO OF OUR BELIEVING SERVANTS 
   SO ALSO WAS ELIAS AMONG THOSE SENT  BY US  
   BEHOLD  HE SAID TO HIS PEOPLE    WILL YE NOT FEAR  GOD   
     WILL YE CALL UPON BAAL AND FORSAKE THE BEST OF CREATORS  
     GOD  YOUR LORD AND CHERISHER AND THE LORD AND CHERISHER OF YOUR FATHERS OF OLD   
   BUT THEY REJECTED HIM  AND THEY WILL CERTAINLY BE CALLED UP  FOR PUNISHMENT   
   EXCEPT THE SINCERE AND DEVOTED SERVANTS OF GOD  AMONG THEM  
   AND WE LEFT  THIS BLESSING  FOR HIM AMONG GENERATIONS  TO COME  IN LATER TIMES  
     PEACE AND SALUTATION TO SUCH AS ELIAS   
   THUS INDEED DO WE REWARD THOSE WHO DO RIGHT 
   FOR HE WAS ONE OF OUR BELIEVING SERVANTS 
   SO ALSO WAS LŪT AMONG THOSE SENT  BY US  
   BEHOLD  WE DELIVERED HIM AND HIS ADHERENTS  ALL
   EXCEPT AN OLD WOMAN WHO WAS AMONG THOSE WHO LAGGED BEHIND  
   THEN WE DESTROYED THE REST 
   VERILY  YE PASS BY THEIR  SITES   BY DAY 
   AND BY NIGHT   WILL YE NOT UNDERSTAND  SECTION  
   SO ALSO WAS JONAH AMONG THOSE SENT  BY US  
   WHEN HE RAN AWAY  LIKE A SLAVE FROM CAPTIVITY  TO THE SHIP  FULLY  LADEN 
   HE  AGREED TO  CAST LOTS  AND HE WAS CONDEMNED  
   THEN THE BIG FISH DID SWALLOW HIM  AND HE HAD DONE ACTS WORTHY OF BLAME 
   HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT HE  REPENTED AND  GLORIFIED GOD 
   HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE REMAINED INSIDE THE FISH TILL THE DAY OF RESURRECTION 
   BUT WE CAST HIM FORTH ON THE NAKED SHORE IN A STATE OF SICKNESS 
   AND WE CAUSED TO GROW  OVER HIM  A SPREADING PLANT OF THE GOURD KIND 
   AND WE SENT HIM  ON A MISSION  TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND  MEN  OR MORE 
   AND THEY BELIEVED   SO WE PERMITTED THEM TO ENJOY  THEIR LIFE  FOR A WHILE 
   NOW ASK THEM THEIR OPINION   IS IT THAT THY LORD HAS  ONLY  DAUGHTERS  AND THEY HAVE SONS   
   OR THAT WE CREATED THE ANGELS FEMALE  AND THEY ARE WITNESSES  THERETO   
   IS IT NOT THAT THEY SAY  FROM THEIR OWN INVENTION 
     GOD HAS BEGOTTEN CHILDREN    BUT THEY ARE LIARS  
   DID HE  THEN  CHOOSE DAUGHTERS RATHER THAN SONS  
   WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU   HOW JUDGE YE  
   WILL YE NOT THEN RECEIVE ADMONITION  
   OR HAVE YE AN AUTHORITY MANIFEST  
   THEN BRING YE YOUR BOOK  OF AUTHORITY  IF YE BE TRUTHFUL  
   AND THEY HAVE INVENTED A BLOOD RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIM AND THE JINNS   BUT THE JINNS KNOW  QUITE WELL  THAT THEY HAVE INDEED TO APPEAR  BEFORE HIS JUDGMENT SEAT   
   GLORY TO GOD    HE IS FREE  FROM THE THINGS THEY ASCRIBE  TO HIM   
   NOT  SO DO  THE SERVANTS OF GOD  SINCERE AND DEVOTED 
   FOR  VERILY  NEITHER YE NOR THOSE YE WORSHIP 
   CAN LEAD  ANY  INTO TEMPTATION CONCERNING GOD 
   EXCEPT SUCH AS ARE  THEMSELVES  GOING TO THE BLAZING FIRE  
    THOSE RANGED IN RANKS SAY      NOT ONE OF US BUT HAS A PLACE APPOINTED  
     AND WE ARE VERILY RANGED IN RANKS  FOR SERVICE   
     AND WE ARE VERILY THOSE WHO DECLARE  GOD S  GLORY   
   AND THERE WERE THOSE WHO SAID 
     IF ONLY WE HAD HAD BEFORE US A MESSAGE FROM THOSE OF OLD 
     WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN SERVANTS OF GOD  SINCERE  AND DEVOTED    
   BUT  NOW THAT THE QUR ĀN HAS COME   THEY REJECT IT   BUT SOON WILL THEY KNOW  
   ALREADY HAS OUR WORD BEEN PASSED BEFORE  THIS  TO OUR SERVANTS SENT  BY US  
   THAT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE ASSISTED 
   AND THAT OUR FORCES   THEY SURELY MUST CONQUER 
   SO TURN THOU AWAY FROM THEM FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
   AND WATCH THEM  HOW THEY FARE   AND THEY SOON SHALL SEE  HOW THOU FAREST   
   DO THEY WISH  INDEED  TO HURRY ON OUR PUNISHMENT  
   BUT WHEN IT DESCENDS INTO THE OPEN SPACE BEFORE THEM  EVIL WILL BE THE MORNING FOR THOSE WHO WERE WARNED  AND HEEDED NOT   
   SO TURN THOU AWAY FROM THEM FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
   AND WATCH  HOW THEY FARE  AND THEY SOON SHALL SEE  HOW THOU FAREST   
   GLORY TO THY LORD  THE LORD OF HONOUR AND POWER    HE IS FREE  FROM WHAT THEY ASCRIBE  TO HIM   
   AND PEACE ON THE APOSTLES  
   AND PRAISE TO GOD  THE LORD AND CHERISHER OF THE WORLDS 
   SĀD   BY THE QUR ĀN  FULL OF ADMONITION    THIS IS THE TRUTH  
   BUT THE UNBELIEVERS  ARE STEEPED  IN SELF GLORY AND SEPARATISM 
   HOW MANY GENERATIONS BEFORE THEM DID WE DESTROY   IN THE END THEY CRIED  FOR MERCY  WHEN THERE WAS NO LONGER TIME FOR BEING SAVED  
   SO THEY WONDER THAT A WARNER HAS COME TO THEM FROM AMONG THEMSELVES   AND THE UNBELIEVERS SAY    THIS IS A SORCERER TELLING LIES  
     HAS HE MADE THE GODS  ALL  INTO ONE GOD   TRULY THIS IS A WONDERFUL THING    
   AND THE LEADERS AMONG THEM GO AWAY  IMPATIENTLY    SAYING     WALK YE AWAY  AND REMAIN CONSTANT TO YOUR GODS   FOR THIS IS TRULY A THING DESIGNED  AGAINST YOU   
     WE NEVER HEARD  THE LIKE  OF THIS AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THESE LATTER DAYS   THIS IS NOTHING BUT A MADE UP TALE    
     WHAT   HAS THE MESSAGE BEEN SENT TO HIM   OF ALL PERSONS  AMONG US     BUT THEY ARE IN DOUBT CONCERNING MY  OWN  MESSAGE   NAY  THEY HAVE NOT YET TASTED MY PUNISHMENT  
   OR HAVE THEY THE TREASURES OF THE MERCY OF THY LORD   THE EXALTED IN POWER  THE GRANTOR OF BOUNTIES WITHOUT MEASURE  
   OR HAVE THEY THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL BETWEEN   IF SO  LET THEM MOUNT UP WITH THE ROPES AND MEANS  TO REACH THAT END   
   BUT THERE WILL BE PUT TO FLIGHT EVEN A HOST OF CONFEDERATES 
   BEFORE THEM  WERE MANY WHO  REJECTED APOSTLES   THE PEOPLE OF NOAH  AND  AD  AND PHARAOH THE LORD OF STAKES 
   AND THAMŪD  AND THE PEOPLE OF LŪT  AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE WOOD   SUCH WERE THE CONFEDERATES 
   NOT ONE  OF THEM  BUT REJECTED THE APOSTLES  BUT MY PUNISHMENT CAME JUSTLY AND INEVITABLY  ON THEM  SECTION  
   THESE  TO DAY  ONLY WAIT FOR A SINGLE MIGHTY BLAST  WHICH  WHEN IT COMES  WILL BROOK NO DELAY 
   THEY SAY     OUR LORD   HASTEN TO US OUR SENTENCE  EVEN  BEFORE THE DAY OF ACCOUNT    
   HAVE PATIENCE AT WHAT THEY SAY  AND REMEMBER OUR SERVANT DAVID  THE MAN OF STRENGTH   FOR HE EVER TURNED  TO GOD  
   IT WAS WE THAT MADE THE HILLS DECLARE  IN UNISON WITH HIM  OUR PRAISES  AT EVENTIDE AND AT BREAK OF DAY 
   AND THE BIRDS GATHERED  IN ASSEMBLIES    ALL WITH HIM DID TURN  TO GOD  
   WE STRENGTHENED HIS KINGDOM  AND GAVE HIM WISDOM AND SOUND JUDGMENT IN SPEECH AND DECISION 
   HAS THE STORY OF THE DISPUTANTS REACHED THEE   BEHOLD  THEY CLIMBED OVER THE WALL OF THE PRIVATE CHAMBER  
   WHEN THEY ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF DAVID  AND HE WAS TERRIFIED OF THEM  THEY SAID     FEAR NOT   WE ARE TWO DISPUTANTS  ONE OF WHOM HAS WRONGED THE OTHER   DECIDE NOW BETWEEN US WITH TRUTH  AND TREAT US NOT WITH UNJUSTICE  BUT GUIDE US TO THE EVEN PATH 
     THIS MAN IS MY BROTHER   HE HAS NINE AND NINETY EWES  AND I HAVE  BUT  ONE   YET HE SAYS    COMMIT HER TO MY CARE    AND IS  MOREOVER  HARSH TO ME IN SPEECH  
    DAVID  SAID     HE HAS UNDOUBTEDLY WRONGED THEE IN DEMANDING THY  SINGLE  EWE TO BE ADDED TO HIS  FLOCK OF  EWES   TRULY MANY ARE THE PARTNERS  IN BUSINESS  WHO WRONG EACH OTHER   NOT SO DO THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  AND HOW FEW ARE THEY      AND DAVID GATHERED THAT WE HAD TRIED HIM   HE ASKED FORGIVENESS OF HIS LORD  FELL DOWN  BOWING  IN PROSTRATION   AND TURNED  TO GOD IN REPENTANCE  
   SO WE FORGAVE HIM THIS  LAPSE    HE ENJOYED  INDEED  A NEAR APPROACH TO US  AND A BEAUTIFUL PLACE OF  FINAL  RETURN 
   O DAVID   WE DID INDEED MAKE THEE A VICEGERENT ON EARTH   SO JUDGE THOU BETWEEN MEN IN TRUTH  AND JUSTICE    NOR FOLLOW THOU THE LUSTS  OF THY HEART   FOR THEY WILL MISLEAD THEE FROM THE PATH OF GOD   FOR THOSE WHO WANDER ASTRAY FROM THE PATH OF GOD  IS A PENALTY GRIEVOUS  FOR THAT THEY FORGET THE DAY OF ACCOUNT SECTION  
   NOT WITHOUT PURPOSE DID WE CREATE HEAVEN AND EARTH AND ALL BETWEEN   THAT WERE THE THOUGHT OF UNBELIEVERS   BUT WOE TO THE UNBELIEVERS BECAUSE OF THE FIRE  OF HELL   
   SHALL WE TREAT THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  THE SAME AS THOSE WHO DO MISCHIEF ON EARTH   SHALL WE TREAT THOSE WHO GUARD AGAINST EVIL  THE SAME AS THOSE WHO TURN ASIDE FROM THE RIGHT  
    HERE IS  A BOOK WHICH WE HAVE SENT DOWN UNTO THEE  FULL OF BLESSINGS  THAT THEY MAY MEDITATE ON ITS SIGNS  AND THAT MEN OF UNDERSTANDING MAY RECEIVE ADMONITION 
   TO DAVID WE GAVE SOLOMON  FOR A SON    HOW EXCELLENT IN OUR SERVICE   EVER DID HE TURN  TO US   
   BEHOLD  THERE WERE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AT EVENTIDE  COURSERS OF THE HIGHEST BREEDING  AND SWIFT OF FOOT  
   AND HE SAID    TRULY DO I LOVE THE LOVE OF GOOD WITH A VIEW TO THE GLORY OF MY LORD     UNTIL  THE SUN  WAS HIDDEN IN THE VEIL  OF NIGHT   
     BRING THEM BACK TO ME   THEN BEGAN HE TO PASS HIS HAND OVER  THEIR  LEGS AND THEIR NECKS 
   AND WE DID TRY SOLOMON   WE PLACED ON HIS THRONE A BODY  WITHOUT LIFE    BUT HE DID TURN  TO US IN TRUE DEVOTION   
   HE SAID    O MY LORD   FORGIVE ME  AND GRANT ME A KINGDOM WHICH   IT MAY BE   SUITS NOT ANOTHER AFTER ME   FOR THOU ART THE GRANTOR OF BOUNTIES  WITHOUT MEASURE   
   THEN WE SUBJECTED THE WIND TO HIS POWER  TO FLOW GENTLY TO HIS ORDER  WHITHERSOEVER HE WILLED  
   AS ALSO THE EVIL ONES   INCLUDING  EVERY KIND OF BUILDER AND DIVER  
   AS ALSO OTHERS BOUND TOGETHER IN FETTERS 
     SUCH ARE OUR BOUNTIES   WHETHER THOU BESTOW THEM  ON OTHERS  OR WITHHOLD THEM  NO ACCOUNT WILL BE ASKED  
   AND HE ENJOYED  INDEED  A NEAR APPROACH TO US  AND A BEAUTIFUL PLACE OF  FINAL  RETURN SECTION  
   COMMEMORATE OUR SERVANT JOB  BEHOLD HE CRIED TO HIS LORD     THE EVIL ONE HAS AFFLICTED ME WITH DISTRESS AND SUFFERING    
    THE COMMAND WAS GIVEN     STRIKE WITH THY FOOT   HERE IS  WATER  WHEREIN TO WASH  COOL AND REFRESHING  AND  WATER  TO DRINK  
   AND WE GAVE HIM  BACK  HIS PEOPLE AND DOUBLED THEIR NUMBER  AS A GRACE FROM OURSELVES  AND A THING FOR COMMEMORATION  FOR ALL WHO HAVE UNDERSTANDING 
     AND TAKE IN THY HAND A LITTLE GRASS  AND STRIKE THEREWITH   AND BREAK NOT  THY OATH    TRULY WE FOUND HIM FULL OF PATIENCE AND CONSTANCY  HOW EXCELLENT IN OUR SERVICE   EVER DID HE TURN  TO US   
   AND COMMEMORATE OUR SERVANTS ABRAHAM  ISAAC  AND JACOB  POSSESSORS OF POWER AND VISION 
   VERILY WE DID CHOSE THEM FOR A SPECIAL  PURPOSE   PROCLAIMING THE MESSAGE OF THE HEREAFTER 
   THEY WERE  IN OUR SIGHT  TRULY  OF THE COMPANY OF THE ELECT AND THE GOOD 
   AND COMMEMORATE ISMĀ ĪL  ELISHA  AND ZUL KIFL   EACH OF THEM WAS OF THE COMPANY OF THE GOOD 
   THIS IS A MESSAGE  OF ADMONITION    AND VERILY  FOR THE RIGHTEOUS  IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE OF  FINAL  RETURN  
   GARDENS OF ETERNITY  WHOSE DOORS WILL  EVER  BE OPEN TO THEM  
   THEREIN WILL THEY RECLINE  AT EASE    THEREIN CAN THEY CALL  AT PLEASURE  FOR FRUIT IN ABUNDANCE  AND  DELICIOUS  DRINK  
   AND BESIDE THEM WILL BE CHASTE WOMEN RESTRAINING THEIR GLANCES   COMPANIONS  OF EQUAL AGE

   AND THEY WILL SAY     WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO US THAT WE SEE NOT MEN WHOM WE USED TO NUMBER AMONG THE BAD ONES  
     DID WE TREAT THEM  AS SUCH  IN RIDICULE  OR HAVE  OUR  EYES FAILED TO PERCEIVE THEM    
   TRULY THAT IS JUST AND FITTING   THE MUTUAL RECRIMINATIONS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE FIRE  SECTION  
   SAY     TRULY AM I A WARNER   NO GOD IS THERE BUT THE ONE GOD  SUPREME AND IRRESISTIBLE  
     THE LORD OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND ALL BETWEEN  EXALTED IN MIGHT  ABLE TO ENFORCE HIS WILL  FORGIVING AGAIN AND AGAIN

     WHEN I HAVE FASHIONED HIM  IN DUE PROPORTION  AND BREATHED INTO HIM OF MY SPIRIT  FALL YE DOWN IN OBEISANCE UNTO HIM  
   SO THE ANGELS PROSTRATED THEMSELVES  ALL OF THEM TOGETHER  
   NOT SO IBLĪS   HE WAS HAUGHTY  AND BECAME ONE OF THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH 
    GOD  SAID     O IBLĪS   WHAT PREVENTS THEE FROM PROSTRATING THYSELF TO ONE WHOM I HAVE CREATED WITH MY HANDS   ART THOU HAUGHTY   OR ART THOU ONE OF THE HIGH  AND MIGHTY  ONES   
    IBLĪS  SAID     I AM BETTER THAN HE   THOU CREATEDST ME FROM FIRE  AND HIM THOU CREATEDST FROM CLAY

   IS ONE WHOSE HEART GOD HAS OPENED TO ISLAM  SO THAT HE HAS RECEIVED ENLIGHTENMENT FROM GOD   NO BETTER THAN ONE HARD HEARTED    WOE TO THOSE WHOSE HEARTS ARE HARDENED AGAINST CELEBRATING THE PRAISES OF GOD   THEY ARE MANIFESTLY WANDERING  IN ERROR   
   GOD HAS REVEALED  FROM TIME TO TIME  THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MESSAGE IN THE FORM OF A BOOK  CONSISTENT WITH ITSELF   YET  REPEATING  ITS TEACHING IN VARIOUS ASPECTS    THE SKINS OF THOSE WHO FEAR THEIR LORD TREMBLE THEREAT   THEN THEIR SKINS AND THEIR HEARTS DO SOFTEN TO THE CELEBRATION OF GOD S PRAISES  SUCH IS THE GUIDANCE OF GOD   HE GUIDES THEREWITH WHOM HE PLEASES  BUT SUCH AS GOD LEAVES TO STRAY  CAN HAVE NONE TO GUIDE 
   IS  THEN  ONE WHO HAS TO FEAR THE BRUNT OF THE PENALTY ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT  AND RECEIVE IT  ON HIS FACE   LIKE ONE GUARDED THEREFROM    IT WILL BE SAID TO THE WRONG DOERS     TASTE YE  THE FRUITS OF  WHAT YE EARNED    
   THOSE BEFORE THEM  ALSO  REJECTED  REVELATION   AND SO THE PUNISHMENT CAME TO THEM FROM DIRECTIONS THEY DID NOT PERCEIVE 
   SO GOD GAVE THEM A TASTE OF HUMILIATION IN THE PRESENT LIFE  BUT GREATER IS THE PUNISHMENT OF THE HEREAFTER  IF THEY ONLY KNEW  
   WE HAVE PUT FORTH FOR MEN  IN THIS QUR ĀN EVERY KIND OF PARABLE  IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY RECEIVE ADMONITION 
    IT IS  A QUR ĀN IN ARABIC  WITHOUT ANY CROOKEDNESS  THEREIN    IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY GUARD AGAINST EVIL 
   GOD PUTS FORTH A PARABLE  A MAN BELONGING TO MANY PARTNERS AT VARIANCE WITH EACH OTHER  AND A MAN BELONGING ENTIRELY TO ONE MASTER   ARE THOSE TWO EQUAL IN COMPARISON   PRAISE BE TO GOD   BUT MOST OF THEM HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE 
   TRULY THOU WILT DIE  ONE DAY   AND TRULY THEY  TOO  WILL DIE  ONE DAY  
   IN THE END WILL YE  ALL   ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT  SETTLE YOUR DISPUTES IN THE PRESENCE OF YOUR LORD SECTION  
   WHO  THEN  DOTH MORE WRONG THAN ONE WHO UTTERS A LIE CONCERNING GOD  AND REJECTS THE TRUTH WHEN IT COMES TO HIM IS THERE NOT IN HELL AN ABODE FOR BLASPHEMERS  
   AND HE WHO BRINGS THE TRUTH AND HE WHO CONFIRMS  AND SUPPORTS  IT  SUCH ARE THE MEN WHO DO RIGHT 
   THEY SHALL HAVE ALL THAT THEY WISH FOR  IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR LORD   SUCH IS THE REWARD OF THOSE WHO DO GOOD  
   SO THAT GOD WILL TURN OFF FROM THEM  EVEN  THE WORST IN THEIR DEEDS AND GIVE THEM THEIR REWARD ACCORDING TO THE BEST OF WHAT THEY HAVE DONE 
   IS NOT GOD ENOUGH FOR HIS SERVANT   BUT THEY TRY TO FRIGHTEN THEE WITH OTHER  GODS  BESIDES HIM   FOR SUCH AS GOD LEAVES TO STRAY  THERE CAN BE NO GUIDE 
   AND SUCH AS GOD DOTH GUIDE THERE CAN BE NONE TO LEAD ASTRAY  IS NOT GOD EXALTED IN POWER   ABLE TO ENFORCE HIS WILL   LORD OF RETRIBUTION  
   IF INDEED THOU ASK THEM WHO IT IS THAT CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  THEY WOULD BE SURE TO SAY    GOD    SAY     SEE YE THEN   THE THINGS THAT YE INVOKE BESIDES GOD  CAN THEY  IF GOD WILLS SOME PENALTY FOR ME  REMOVE HIS PENALTY    OR IF HE WILLS SOME GRACE FOR ME  CAN THEY KEEP BACK HIS GRACE     SAY     SUFFICIENT IS GOD FOR ME   IN HIM TRUST THOSE WHO PUT THEIR TRUST  
   SAY     O MY PEOPLE   DO WHATEVER YE CAN   I WILL DO  MY PART    BUT SOON WILL YE KNOW 
     WHO IT IS TO WHOM COMES A PENALTY OF IGNOMINY  AND ON WHOM DESCENDS A PENALTY THAT ABIDES  
   VERILY WE HAVE REVEALED THE BOOK TO THEE IN TRUTH  FOR  INSTRUCTING  MANKIND  HE  THEN  THAT RECEIVES GUIDANCE BENEFITS HIS OWN SOUL   BUT HE THAT STRAYS INJURES HIS OWN SOUL  NOR ART THOU SET OVER THEM TO DISPOSE OF THEIR AFFAIRS SECTION  
   IT IS GOD THAT TAKES THE SOULS  OF MEN  AT DEATH   AND THOSE THAT DIE NOT  HE TAKES  DURING THEIR SLEEP   THOSE ON WHOM HE HAS PASSED THE DECREE OF DEATH  HE KEEPS BACK  FROM RETURNING TO LIFE   BUT THE REST HE SENDS  TO THEIR BODIES  FOR A TERM APPOINTED  VERILY IN THIS ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE WHO REFLECT 
   WHAT   DO THEY TAKE FOR INTERCESSORS OTHERS BESIDES GOD   SAY     EVEN IF THEY HAVE NO POWER WHATEVER AND NO INTELLIGENCE    
   SAY     TO GOD BELONGS EXCLUSIVELY  THE RIGHT TO GRANT  INTERCESSION   TO HIM BELONGS THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   IN THE END  IT IS TO HIM THAT YE SHALL BE BROUGHT BACK  
   WHEN GOD  THE ONE AND ONLY  IS MENTIONED  THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT IN THE HEREAFTER ARE FILLED WITH DISGUST AND HORROR   BUT WHEN  GODS  OTHER THAN HE ARE MENTIONED  BEHOLD  THEY ARE FILLED WITH JOY  
   SAY     O GOD   CREATOR OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   KNOWER OF ALL THAT IS HIDDEN AND OPEN   IT IS THOU THAT WILT JUDGE BETWEEN THY SERVANTS IN THOSE MATTERS ABOUT WHICH THEY HAVE DIFFERED  
   EVEN IF THE WRONG DOERS HAD ALL THAT THERE IS ON EARTH  AND AS MUCH MORE   IN VAIN  WOULD THEY OFFER IT FOR RANSOM FROM THE PAIN OF THE PENALTY ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT   BUT SOMETHING WILL CONFRONT THEM FROM GOD  WHICH THEY COULD NEVER HAVE COUNTED UPON  
   FOR THE EVILS OF THEIR DEEDS WILL CONFRONT THEM  AND THEY WILL BE  COMPLETELY  ENCIRCLED BY THAT WHICH THEY USED TO MOCK AT  
   NOW  WHEN TROUBLE TOUCHES MAN  HE CRIES TO US   BUT WHEN WE BESTOW A FAVOUR UPON HIM AS FROM OURSELVES  HE SAYS    THIS HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ME BECAUSE OF A CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE  I HAVE      NAY  BUT THIS IS BUT A TRIAL  BUT MOST OF THEM UNDERSTAND NOT  
   THUS DID THE  GENERATIONS  BEFORE THEM SAY   BUT ALL THAT THEY DID WAS OF NO PROFIT TO THEM 
   NAY  THE EVIL RESULTS OF THEIR DEEDS OVERTOOK THEM  AND THE WRONG DOERS OF THIS  GENERATION  THE EVIL RESULTS OF THEIR DEEDS WILL SOON OVERTAKE THEM  TOO   AND THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FRUSTRATE  OUR PLAN   
   KNOW THEY NOT THAT GOD ENLARGES THE PROVISION OR RESTRICTS IT  FOR ANY HE PLEASES   VERILY  IN THIS ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE  SECTION  
   SAY     O MY SERVANTS WHO HAVE TRANSGRESSED AGAINST THEIR SOULS   DESPAIR NOT OF THE MERCY OF GOD   FOR GOD FORGIVES ALL SINS   FOR HE IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
     TURN YE TO YOUR LORD  IN REPENTANCE  AND BOW TO HIS  WILL  BEFORE THE PENALTY COMES ON YOU   AFTER THAT YE SHALL NOT BE HELPED 
     AND FOLLOW THE BEST OF  THE COURSES  REVEALED TO YOU FROM YOUR LORD  BEFORE THE PENALTY COMES ON YOU OF A SUDDEN  WHILE YE PERCEIVE NOT   
     LEST THE SOUL SHOULD  THEN  SAY     AH   WOE IS ME   IN THAT I NEGLECTED  MY DUTY  TOWARDS GOD  AND WAS BUT AMONG THOSE WHO MOCKED     
     OR  LEST  IT SHOULD SAY     IF ONLY GOD HAD GUIDED ME  I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN AMONG THE RIGHTEOUS     
     OR  LEST  IT SHOULD SAY WHEN IT  ACTUALLY  SEES THE PENALTY     IF ONLY I HAD ANOTHER CHANCE  I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE AMONG THOSE WHO DO GOOD    
      THE REPLY WILL BE &COLON     NAY  BUT THERE CAME TO THEE MY SIGNS AND THOU DIDST REJECT THEM   THOU WAST HAUGHTY  AND BECAME ONE OF THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH      
   ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT WILT THOU SEE THOSE WHO TOLD LIES AGAINST GOD    THEIR FACES WILL BE TURNED BLACK   IS THERE NOT IN HELL AN ABODE FOR THE HAUGHTY  
   BUT GOD WILL DELIVER THE RIGHTEOUS TO THEIR PLACE OF SALVATION   NO EVIL SHALL TOUCH THEM  NOR SHALL THEY GRIEVE 
   GOD IS THE CREATOR OF ALL THINGS  AND HE IS THE GUARDIAN AND DISPOSER OF ALL AFFAIRS 
   TO HIM BELONG THE KEYS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   AND THOSE WHO REJECT THE SIGNS OF GOD   IT IS THEY WHO WILL BE IN LOSS SECTION  
   SAY     IS IT SOME ONE OTHER THAN GOD THAT YE ORDER ME TO WORSHIP  O YE IGNORANT ONES    
   BUT IT HAS ALREADY BEEN REVEALED TO THEE   AS IT WAS TO THOSE BEFORE THEE    IF THOU WERT TO JOIN  GODS WITH GOD   TRULY FRUITLESS WILL BE THY WORK  IN LIFE  AND THOU WILT SURELY BE IN THE RANKS OF THOSE WHO LOSE  ALL SPIRITUAL GOOD   
   NAY  BUT WORSHIP GOD AND BE OF THOSE WHO GIVE THANKS 
   NO JUST ESTIMATE HAVE THEY MADE OF GOD SUCH AS IS DUE TO HIM   ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT THE WHOLE OF THE EARTH WILL BE BUT HIS HANDFUL  AND THE HEAVENS WILL BE ROLLED UP IN HIS RIGHT HAND   GLORY TO HIM   HIGH IS HE ABOVE THE PARTNERS THEY ATTRIBUTE TO HIM  
   THE TRUMPET WILL  JUST  BE SOUNDED  WHEN ALL THAT ARE IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH WILL SWOON  EXCEPT SUCH AS IT WILL PLEASE GOD  TO EXEMPT   THEN WILL A SECOND ONE BE SOUNDED  WHEN  BEHOLD  THEY WILL BE STANDING AND LOOKING ON  
   AND THE EARTH WILL SHINE WITH THE GLORY OF ITS LORD   THE RECORD  OF DEEDS  WILL BE PLACED  OPEN    THE PROPHETS AND THE WITNESSES WILL BE BROUGHT FORWARD   AND A JUST DECISION PRONOUNCED BETWEEN THEM   AND THEY WILL NOT BE WRONGED  IN THE LEAST  
   AND TO EVERY SOUL WILL BE PAID IN FULL  THE FRUIT  OF ITS DEEDS   AND  GOD  KNOWETH BEST ALL THAT THEY DO SECTION  
   THE UNBELIEVERS WILL BE LED TO HELL IN CROWD   UNTIL  WHEN THEY ARRIVE THERE  ITS GATES WILL BE OPENED  AND ITS KEEPERS WILL SAY    DID NOT APOSTLES COME TO YOU FROM AMONG YOURSELVES  REHEARSING TO YOU THE SIGNS OF YOUR LORD  AND WARNING YOU OF THE MEETING OF THIS DAY OF YOURS     THE ANSWER WILL BE     TRUE   BUT THE DECREE OF PUNISHMENT HAS BEEN PROVED TRUE AGAINST THE UNBELIEVERS    
    TO THEM  WILL BE SAID     ENTER YE THE GATES OF HELL  TO DWELL THEREIN   AND EVIL IS  THIS  ABODE OF THE ARROGANT    
   AND THOSE WHO FEARED THEIR LORD WILL BE LED TO THE GARDEN IN CROWDS   UNTIL BEHOLD  THEY ARRIVE THERE   ITS GATES WILL BE OPENED   AND ITS KEEPERS WILL SAY     PEACE BE UPON YOU   WELL HAVE YE DONE   ENTER YE HERE  TO DWELL THEREIN  
   THEY WILL SAY     PRAISE BE TO GOD  WHO HAS TRULY FULFILLED HIS PROMISE TO US  AND HAS GIVEN US  THIS  LAND IN HERITAGE   WE CAN DWELL IN THE GARDEN AS WE WILL   HOW EXCELLENT A REWARD FOR THOSE WHO WORK  RIGHTEOUSNESS     
   AND THOU WILT SEE THE ANGELS SURROUNDING THE THRONE  DIVINE  ON ALL SIDES  SINGING GLORY AND PRAISE TO THEIR LORD  THE DECISION BETWEEN THEM  AT JUDGMENT  WILL BE IN  PERFECT  JUSTICE  AND THE CRY  ON ALL SIDES  WILL BE    PRAISE BE TO GOD  THE LORD OF THE WORLDS    
   HĀ MĪM 
   THE REVELATION OF THIS BOOK IS FROM GOD  EXALTED IN POWER  FULL OF KNOWLEDGE  
   WHO FORGIVETH SIN  ACCEPTETH REPENTANCE  IS STRICT IN PUNISHMENT  AND HATH A LONG REACH  IN ALL THINGS   THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE   TO HIM IS THE FINAL GOAL 
   NONE CAN DISPUTE ABOUT THE SIGNS OF GOD BUT THE UNBELIEVERS  LET NOT  THEN  THEIR STRUTTING ABOUT THROUGH THE LAND DECEIVE THEE  
   BUT  THERE WERE PEOPLE  BEFORE THEM  WHO DENIED  THE SIGNS   THE PEOPLE OF NOAH  AND THE CONFEDERATES  OF EVIL  AFTER THEM   AND EVERY PEOPLE PLOTTED AGAINST THEIR PROPHET  TO SEIZE HIM  AND DISPUTED BY MEANS OF VANITIES  THEREWITH TO CONDEMN THE TRUTH   BUT IT WAS I THAT SEIZED THEM   AND HOW  TERRIBLE  WAS MY REQUITAL  
   THUS WAS THE DECREE OF THY LORD PROVED TRUE AGAINST THE UNBELIEVERS   THAT TRULY THEY ARE COMPANIONS OF THE FIRE  
   THOSE WHO SUSTAIN THE THRONE  OF GOD  AND THOSE AROUND IT SING GLORY AND PRAISE TO THEIR LORD   BELIEVE IN HIM   AND IMPLORE FORGIVENESS FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE     OUR LORD   THY REACH IS OVER ALL THINGS  IN MERCY AND KNOWLEDGE  FORGIVE  THEN  THOSE WHO TURN IN REPENTANCE  AND FOLLOW THY PATH   AND PRESERVE THEM FROM THE PENALTY OF THE BLAZING FIRE  
     AND GRANT  OUR LORD   THAT THEY ENTER THE GARDENS OF ETERNITY  WHICH THOU HAST PROMISED TO THEM  AND TO THE RIGHTEOUS AMONG THEIR FATHERS  THEIR WIVES  AND THEIR POSTERITY   FOR THOU ART  HE   THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  FULL OF WISDOM 
     AND PRESERVE THEM FROM  ALL  ILLS   AND ANY WHOM THOU DOST PRESERVE FROM ILLS THAT DAY  ON THEM WILT THOU HAVE BESTOWED MERCY INDEED   AND THAT WILL BE TRULY  FOR THEM  THE HIGHEST ACHIEVEMENT  SECTION  
   THE UNBELIEVERS WILL BE ADDRESSED     GREATER WAS THE AVERSION OF GOD TO YOU THAN  IS  YOUR AVERSION TO YOURSELVES  SEEING THAT YE WERE CALLED TO THE FAITH AND YE USED TO REFUSE  
   THEY WILL SAY     OUR LORD   TWICE HAST THOU MADE US WITHOUT LIFE  AND TWICE HAST THOU GIVEN US LIFE   NOW HAVE WE RECOGNISED OUR SINS   IS THERE ANY WAY OUT  OF THIS     
    THE ANSWER WILL BE &COLON     THIS IS BECAUSE  WHEN GOD WAS INVOKED AS THE ONLY  OBJECT OF WORSHIP   YE DID REJECT FAITH  BUT WHEN PARTNERS WERE JOINED TO HIM  YE BELIEVED   THE COMMAND IS WITH GOD  MOST HIGH  MOST GREAT    
   HE IT IS WHO SHOWETH YOU HIS SIGNS  AND SENDETH DOWN SUSTENANCE FOR YOU FROM THE SKY   BUT ONLY THOSE RECEIVE ADMONITION WHO TURN  TO GOD  
   CALL YE  THEN  UPON GOD WITH SINCERE DEVOTION TO HIM  EVEN THOUGH THE UNBELIEVERS MAY DETEST IT 
   RAISED HIGH ABOVE RANKS  OR DEGREES    HE IS  THE LORD OF THE THRONE  OF AUTHORITY    BY HIS COMMAND DOTH HE SEND THE SPIRIT  OF INSPIRATION  TO ANY OF HIS SERVANTS HE PLEASES  THAT IT MAY WARN  MEN  OF THE DAY OF MUTUAL MEETING  
   THE DAY WHEREON THEY WILL  ALL  COME FORTH   NOT A SINGLE THING CONCERNING THEM IS HIDDEN FROM GOD  WHOSE WILL BE THE DOMINION THAT DAY   THAT OF GOD  THE ONE  THE IRRESISTIBLE  
   THAT DAY WILL EVERY SOUL BE REQUITED FOR WHAT IT EARNED   NO INJUSTICE WILL THERE BE THAT DAY  FOR GOD IS SWIFT IN TAKING ACCOUNT 
   WARN THEM OF THE DAY THAT IS  EVER  DRAWING NEAR  WHEN THE HEARTS WILL  COME  RIGHT UP TO THE THROATS TO CHOKE  THEM    NO INTIMATE FRIEND NOR INTERCESSOR WILL THE WRONG DOERS HAVE  WHO COULD BE LISTENED TO 
    GOD  KNOWS OF  THE TRICKS  THAT DECEIVE WITH THE EYES  AND ALL THAT HEARTS  OF MEN  CONCEAL 
   AND GOD WILL JUDGE WITH  JUSTICE AND  TRUTH   BUT THOSE WHOM  MEN  INVOKE BESIDES HIM  WILL NOT  BE IN A POSITION  TO JUDGE AT ALL  VERILY IT IS GOD  ALONE  WHO HEARS AND SEES  ALL THINGS  SECTION  
   DO THEY NOT TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH AND SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE BEFORE THEM   THEY WERE EVEN SUPERIOR TO THEM IN STRENGTH  AND IN THE TRACES  THEY HAVE LEFT  IN THE LAND   BUT GOD DID CALL THEM TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR SINS  AND NONE HAD THEY TO DEFEND THEM AGAINST GOD 
   THAT WAS BECAUSE THERE CAME TO THEM THEIR APOSTLES WITH CLEAR  SIGNS   BUT THEY REJECTED THEM   SO GOD CALLED THEM TO ACCOUNT   FOR HE IS FULL OF STRENGTH  STRICT IN PUNISHMENT 
   OF OLD WE SENT MOSES  WITH OUR SIGNS AND AN AUTHORITY MANIFEST 
   TO PHARAOH  HĀMĀN  AND QĀRŪN   BUT THEY CALLED  HIM    A SORCERER TELLING LIES     
   NOW  WHEN HE CAME TO THEM IN TRUTH  FROM US  THEY SAID    SLAY THE SONS OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE WITH HIM  AND KEEP ALIVE THEIR FEMALES    BUT THE PLOTS OF UNBELIEVERS  END  IN NOTHING BUT ERRORS  AND DELUSIONS    
   SAID PHARAOH     LEAVE ME TO SLAY MOSES   AND LET HIM CALL ON HIS LORD   WHAT I FEAR IS LEST HE SHOULD CHANGE YOUR RELIGION  OR LEST HE SHOULD CAUSE MISCHIEF TO APPEAR IN THE LAND    
   MOSES SAID     I HAVE INDEED CALLED UPON MY LORD AND YOUR LORD  FOR PROTECTION  FROM EVERY ARROGANT ONE WHO BELIEVES NOT IN THE DAY OF ACCOUNT    SECTION  
   A BELIEVER  A MAN FROM AMONG THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH  WHO HAD CONCEALED HIS FAITH  SAID     WILL YE SLAY A MAN BECAUSE HE SAYS    MY LORD IS GOD      WHEN HE HAS INDEED COME TO YOU WITH CLEAR  SIGNS  FROM YOUR LORD   AND IF HE BE A LIAR  ON HIM IS  THE SIN OF  HIS LIE   BUT  IF HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH  THEN WILL FALL ON YOU SOMETHING OF THE  CALAMITY  OF WHICH HE WARNS YOU   TRULY GOD GUIDES NOT ONE WHO TRANSGRESSES AND LIES  
     O MY PEOPLE   YOURS IS THE DOMINION THIS DAY   YE HAVE THE UPPER HAND IN THE LAND   BUT WHO WILL HELP US FROM THE PUNISHMENT OF GOD  SHOULD IT BEFALL US     PHARAOH SAID     I BUT POINT OUT TO YOU THAT WHICH I SEE  MYSELF    NOR DO I GUIDE YOU BUT TO THE PATH OF RIGHT    
   THEN SAID THE MAN WHO BELIEVED     O MY PEOPLE   TRULY I DO FEAR FOR YOU SOMETHING LIKE THE DAY  OF DISASTER  OF THE CONFEDERATES  IN SIN    
     SOMETHING LIKE THE FATE OF THE PEOPLE OF NOAH  THE  AD  AND THE THAMŪD  AND THOSE WHO CAME AFTER THEM   BUT GOD NEVER WISHES INJUSTICE TO HIS SERVANTS 
     AND O MY PEOPLE   I FEAR FOR YOU A DAY WHEN THERE WILL BE MUTUAL CALLING  AND WAILING   
     A DAY WHEN YE SHALL TURN YOUR BACKS AND FLEE   NO DEFENDER SHALL YE HAVE FROM GOD   ANY WHOM GOD LEAVES TO STRAY  THERE IS NONE TO GUIDE 
     AND TO YOU THERE CAME JOSEPH IN TIMES GONE BY  WITH CLEAR SIGNS  BUT YE CEASED NOT TO DOUBT OF THE  MISSION  FOR WHICH HE HAD COME   AT LENGTH  WHEN HE DIED  YE SAID     NO APOSTLE WILL GOD SEND AFTER HIM    THUS DOTH GOD LEAVE TO STRAY SUCH AS TRANSGRESS AND LIVE IN DOUBT  
      SUCH  AS DISPUTE ABOUT THE SIGNS OF GOD  WITHOUT ANY AUTHORITY THAT HATH REACHED THEM  GRIEVOUS AND ODIOUS  IS SUCH CONDUCT  IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND OF THE BELIEVERS  THUS DOTH GOD SEAL UP EVERY HEART OF ARROGANT AND OBSTINATE TRANSGRESSORS  
   PHARAOH SAID     O HĀMĀN   BUILD ME A LOFTY PALACE  THAT I MAY ATTAIN THE WAYS AND MEANS 
     THE WAYS AND MEANS OF  REACHING  THE HEAVENS  AND THAT I MAY MOUNT UP TO THE GOD OF MOSES   BUT AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED  I THINK  MOSES  IS A LIAR     THUS WAS MADE ALLURING  IN PHARAOH S EYES  THE EVIL OF HIS DEEDS  AND HE WAS HINDERED FROM THE PATH   AND THE PLOT OF PHARAOH LED TO NOTHING BUT PERDITION  FOR HIM  SECTION  
   THE MAN WHO BELIEVED SAID FURTHER     O MY PEOPLE   FOLLOW ME   I WILL LEAD YOU TO THE PATH OF RIGHT 
     O MY PEOPLE   THIS LIFE OF THE PRESENT IS NOTHING BUT  TEMPORARY  CONVENIENCE   IT IS THE HEREAFTER THAT IS THE HOME THAT WILL LAST 
     HE THAT WORKS EVIL WILL NOT BE REQUITED BUT BY THE LIKE THEREOF   AND HE THAT WORKS A RIGHTEOUS DEED WHETHER MAN OR WOMAN AND IS A BELIEVER SUCH WILL ENTER THE GARDEN  OF BLISS    THEREIN WILL THEY HAVE ABUNDANCE WITHOUT MEASURE 
     AND O MY PEOPLE   HOW  STRANGE  IT IS FOR ME TO CALL YOU TO SALVATION WHILE YE CALL ME TO THE FIRE  
     YE DO CALL UPON ME TO BLASPHEME AGAINST GOD  AND TO JOIN WITH HIM PARTNERS OF WHOM I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE   AND I CALL YOU TO THE EXALTED IN POWER  WHO FORGIVES AGAIN AND AGAIN    
     WITHOUT DOUBT YE DO CALL ME TO ONE WHO IS NOT FIT TO BE CALLED TO  WHETHER IN THIS WORLD  OR IN THE HEREAFTER   OUR RETURN WILL BE TO GOD   AND THE TRANSGRESSORS WILL BE COMPANIONS OF THE FIRE  
     SOON WILL YE REMEMBER WHAT I SAY TO YOU  NOW   MY  OWN  AFFAIR I COMMIT TO GOD   FOR GOD  EVER  WATCHES OVER HIS SERVANTS  
   THEN GOD SAVED HIM FROM  EVERY  ILL THAT THEY PLOTTED  AGAINST HIM   BUT THE BRUNT OF THE PENALTY ENCOMPASSED ON ALL SIDES THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH 
   IN FRONT OF THE FIRE WILL THEY BE BROUGHT  MORNING AND EVENING   AND  THE SENTENCE WILL BE  ON THE DAY THAT JUDGMENT WILL BE ESTABLISHED     CAST YE THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH INTO THE SEVEREST PENALTY    
   BEHOLD  THEY WILL DISPUTE WITH EACH OTHER IN THE FIRE   THE WEAK ONES  WHO FOLLOWED  WILL SAY TO THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ARROGANT    WE BUT FOLLOWED YOU   CAN YE THEN TAKE  ON YOURSELVES  FROM US SOME SHARE OF THE FIRE    
   THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ARROGANT WILL SAY     WE ARE ALL IN THIS  FIRE    TRULY  GOD HAS JUDGED BETWEEN  HIS  SERVANTS    
   THOSE IN THE FIRE WILL SAY TO THE KEEPERS OF HELL     PRAY TO YOUR LORD TO LIGHTEN US THE PENALTY FOR A DAY  AT LEAST     
   THEY WILL SAY     DID THERE NOT COME TO YOU YOUR APOSTLES WITH CLEAR SIGNS     THEY WILL SAY    YES    THEY WILL REPLY    THEN PRAY  AS YE LIKE    BUT THE PRAYER OF THOSE WITHOUT FAITH IS NOTHING BUT  FUTILE WANDERING  IN  MAZES OF  ERROR    SECTION  
   WE WILL  WITHOUT DOUBT  HELP OUR APOSTLES AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE   BOTH  IN THIS WORLD S LIFE AND ON THE DAY WHEN THE WITNESSES WILL STAND FORTH  
   THE DAY WHEN NO PROFIT WILL IT BE TO WRONG DOERS TO PRESENT THEIR EXCUSES  BUT THEY WILL  ONLY  HAVE THE CURSE AND THE HOME OF MISERY 
   WE DID AFORETIME GIVE MOSES THE  BOOK OF  GUIDANCE  AND WE GAVE THE BOOK IN INHERITANCE TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL  
   A GUIDE AND A MESSAGE TO MEN OF UNDERSTANDING 
   PATIENTLY  THEN  PERSEVERE   FOR THE PROMISE OF GOD IS TRUE   AND ASK FORGIVENESS FOR THY FAULT  AND CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF THY LORD IN THE EVENING AND IN THE MORNING 
   THOSE WHO DISPUTE ABOUT THE SIGNS OF GOD WITHOUT ANY AUTHORITY BESTOWED ON THEM  THERE IS NOTHING IN THEIR BREASTS BUT  THE QUEST OF  GREATNESS  WHICH THEY SHALL NEVER ATTAIN TO   SEEK REFUGE  THEN  IN GOD   IT IS HE WHO HEARS AND SEES  ALL THINGS  
   ASSUREDLY THE CREATION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH IS A GREATER  MATTER  THAN THE CREATION OF MEN   YET MOST MEN UNDERSTAND NOT 
   NOT EQUAL ARE THE BLIND AND THOSE WHO  CLEARLY  SEE   NOR ARE  EQUAL  THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  AND THOSE WHO DO EVIL  LITTLE DO YE LEARN BY ADMONITION  
   THE HOUR WILL CERTAINLY COME   THEREIN IS NO DOUBT   YET MOST MEN BELIEVE NOT 
   AND YOUR LORD SAYS     CALL ON ME   I WILL ANSWER YOUR  PRAYER    BUT THOSE WHO ARE TOO ARROGANT TO SERVE ME WILL SURELY FIND THEMSELVES IN HELL IN HUMILIATION    SECTION  
   IT IS GOD WHO HAS MADE THE NIGHT FOR YOU  THAT YE MAY REST THEREIN  AND THE DAY  AS THAT WHICH HELPS  YOU  TO SEE  VERILY GOD IS FULL OF GRACE AND BOUNTY TO MEN   YET MOST MEN GIVE NO THANKS 
   SUCH IS GOD  YOUR LORD  THE CREATOR OF ALL THINGS  THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE   THEN HOW YE ARE DELUDED AWAY FROM THE TRUTH  
   THUS ARE DELUDED THOSE WHO ARE WONT TO REJECT THE SIGNS OF GOD 
   IT IS GOD WHO HAS MADE FOR YOU THE EARTH AS A RESTING PLACE  AND THE SKY AS A CANOPY  AND HAS GIVEN YOU SHAPE AND MADE YOUR SHAPES BEAUTIFUL  AND HAS PROVIDED FOR YOU SUSTENANCE  OF THINGS PURE AND GOOD   SUCH IS GOD YOUR LORD  SO GLORY TO GOD  THE LORD OF THE WORLDS  
   HE IS THE LIVING  ONE    THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE   CALL UPON HIM  GIVING HIM SINCERE DEVOTION  PRAISE BE TO GOD  LORD OF THE WORLDS  
   SAY     I HAVE BEEN FORBIDDEN TO INVOKE THOSE WHOM YE INVOKE BESIDES GOD  SEEING THAT THE CLEAR SIGNS HAVE COME TO ME FROM MY LORD   AND I HAVE BEEN COMMANDED TO BOW  IN ISLĀM  TO THE LORD OF THE WORLDS  
   IT IS HE WHO HAS CREATED YOU FROM DUST  THEN FROM A SPERM DROP  THEN FROM A LEECH LIKE CLOT   THEN DOES HE GET YOU OUT  INTO THE LIGHT  AS A CHILD   THEN LETS YOU  GROW AND  REACH YOUR AGE OF FULL STRENGTH   THEN LETS YOU BECOME OLD  THOUGH OF YOU THERE ARE SOME WHO DIE BEFORE   AND LETS YOU REACH A TERM APPOINTED   IN ORDER THAT YE MAY LEARN WISDOM 
   IT IS HE WHO GIVES LIFE AND DEATH   AND WHEN HE DECIDES UPON AN AFFAIR  HE SAYS TO IT    BE    AND IT IS SECTION  
   SEEST THOU NOT THOSE THAT DISPUTE CONCERNING THE SIGNS OF GOD   HOW ARE THEY TURNED AWAY  FROM REALITY    
   THOSE WHO REJECT THE BOOK AND THE  REVELATIONS  WITH WHICH WE SENT OUR APOSTLES   BUT SOON SHALL THEY KNOW  
   WHEN THE YOKES  SHALL BE  ROUND THEIR NECKS  AND THE CHAINS   THEY SHALL BE DRAGGED ALONG 
   IN THE BOILING FETID FLUID   THEN IN THE FIRE SHALL THEY BE BURNED  
   THEN SHALL IT BE SAID TO THEM     WHERE ARE THE  DEITIES  TO WHICH YE GAVE PART WORSHIP 
     IN DEROGATION OF GOD     THEY WILL REPLY     THEY HAVE LEFT US IN THE LURCH   NAY  WE INVOKED NOT  OF OLD  ANYTHING  THAT HAD REAL EXISTENCE    THUS DOES GOD LEAVE THE UNBELIEVERS TO STRAY 
     THAT WAS BECAUSE YE WERE WONT TO REJOICE ON THE EARTH IN THINGS OTHER THAN THE TRUTH  AND THAT YE WERE WONT TO BE INSOLENT 
     ENTER YE THE GATES OF HELL  TO DWELL THEREIN   AND EVIL IS  THIS  ABODE OF THE ARROGANT    
   SO PERSEVERE IN PATIENCE   FOR THE PROMISE OF GOD IS TRUE   AND WHETHER WE SHOW THEE  IN THIS LIFE  SOME PART OF WHAT WE PROMISE THEM  OR WE TAKE THY SOUL  TO OUR MERCY   BEFORE THAT    IN ANY CASE  IT IS TO US THAT THEY SHALL  ALL  RETURN 
   WE DID AFORETIME SEND APOSTLES BEFORE THEE   OF THEM THERE ARE SOME WHOSE STORY WE HAVE RELATED TO THEE  AND SOME WHOSE STORY WE HAVE NOT RELATED TO THEE  IT WAS NOT  POSSIBLE  FOR ANY APOSTLE TO BRING A SIGN EXCEPT BY THE LEAVE OF GOD   BUT WHEN THE COMMAND OF GOD ISSUED  THE MATTER WAS DECIDED IN TRUTH AND JUSTICE  AND THERE PERISHED  THERE AND THEN  THOSE WHO STOOD ON FALSEHOODS SECTION  
   IT IS GOD WHO MADE CATTLE FOR YOU  THAT YE MAY USE SOME FOR RIDING AND SOME FOR FOOD  
   AND THERE ARE  OTHER  ADVANTAGES IN THEM FOR YOU  BESIDES    THAT YE MAY THROUGH THEM ATTAIN TO ANY NEED  THERE MAY BE  IN YOUR HEARTS   AND ON THEM AND ON SHIPS YE ARE CARRIED 
   AND HE SHOWS YOU  ALWAYS  HIS SIGNS   THEN WHICH OF THE SIGNS OF GOD WILL YE DENY  
   DO THEY NOT TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH AND SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE BEFORE THEM   THEY WERE MORE NUMEROUS THAN THESE AND SUPERIOR IN STRENGTH AND IN THE TRACES  THEY HAVE LEFT  IN THE LAND   YET ALL THAT THEY ACCOMPLISHED WAS OF NO PROFIT TO THEM 
   FOR WHEN THEIR APOSTLES CAME TO THEM WITH CLEAR SIGNS  THEY EXULTED IN SUCH KNOWLEDGE  AND SKILL  AS THEY HAD   BUT THAT VERY  WRATH  AT WHICH THEY WERE WONT TO SCOFF HEMMED THEM IN 
   BUT WHEN THEY SAW OUR PUNISHMENT  THEY SAID     WE BELIEVE IN GOD  THE ONE GOD AND WE REJECT THE PARTNERS WE USED TO JOIN WITH HIM  
   BUT THEIR PROFESSING THE FAITH WHEN THEY  ACTUALLY  SAW OUR PUNISHMENT WAS NOT GOING TO PROFIT THEM   SUCH HAS BEEN  GOD S WAY OF DEALING WITH HIS SERVANTS  FROM THE MOST ANCIENT TIMES   AND EVEN THUS DID THE REJECTERS OF GOD PERISH  UTTERLY   
   HĀ MĪM  
   A REVELATION FROM  GOD   MOST GRACIOUS  MOST MERCIFUL   
   A BOOK  WHEREOF THE VERSES ARE EXPLAINED IN DETAIL   A QUR ĀN IN ARABIC  FOR PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND   
   GIVING GOOD NEWS AND ADMONITION   YET MOST OF THEM TURN AWAY  AND SO THEY HEAR NOT 
   THEY SAY     OUR HEARTS ARE UNDER VEILS   CONCEALED  FROM THAT TO WHICH THOU DOST INVITE US  AND IN OUR EARS IS A DEAFNESS  AND BETWEEN US AND THEE IS A SCREEN   SO DO THOU  WHAT THOU WILT    FOR US  WE SHALL DO  WHAT WE WILL     
   SAY THOU     I AM BUT A MAN LIKE YOU   IT IS REVEALED TO ME BY INSPIRATION  THAT YOUR GOD IS ONE GOD   SO STAND TRUE TO HIM  AND ASK FOR HIS FORGIVENESS    AND WOE TO THOSE WHO JOIN GODS WITH GOD  
   THOSE WHO PRACTICE NOT REGULAR CHARITY  AND WHO EVEN DENY THE HEREAFTER 
   FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS A REWARD THAT WILL NEVER FAIL SECTION  
   SAY   IS IT THAT YE DENY HIM WHO CREATED THE EARTH IN TWO DAYS   AND DO YE JOIN EQUALS WITH HIM   HE IS THE LORD OF  ALL  THE WORLDS 
   HE SET ON THE  EARTH   MOUNTAINS STANDING FIRM  HIGH ABOVE IT  AND BESTOWED BLESSINGS ON THE EARTH  AND MEASURED THEREIN ALL THINGS TO GIVE THEM NOURISHMENT IN DUE PROPORTION  IN FOUR DAYS  IN ACCORDANCE WITH  THE NEEDS OF  THOSE WHO SEEK  SUSTENANCE  
   MOREOVER HE COMPREHENDED IN HIS DESIGN THE SKY  AND IT HAD BEEN  AS  SMOKE   HE SAID TO IT AND TO THE EARTH     COME YE TOGETHER  WILLINGLY OR UNWILLINGLY    THEY SAID     WE DO COME  TOGETHER   IN WILLING OBEDIENCE   
   SO HE COMPLETED THEM AS SEVEN FIRMAMENTS IN TWO DAYS  AND HE ASSIGNED TO EACH HEAVEN ITS DUTY AND COMMAND  AND WE ADORNED THE LOWER HEAVEN WITH LIGHTS  AND  PROVIDED IT  WITH GUARD  SUCH IS THE DECREE OF  HIM  THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  FULL OF KNOWLEDGE 
   BUT IF THEY TURN AWAY  SAY THOU     I HAVE WARNED YOU OF A STUNNING PUNISHMENT  AS OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING  LIKE THAT WHICH  OVERTOOK  THE  AD AND THE THAMŪD    
   BEHOLD  THE APOSTLES CAME TO THEM  FROM BEFORE THEM AND BEHIND THEM   PREACHING      SERVE NONE BUT GOD    THEY SAID    IF OUR LORD HAD SO PLEASED  HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SENT DOWN ANGELS  TO PREACH    NOW WE REJECT YOUR MISSION  ALTOGETHER    
   NOW THE  AD BEHAVED ARROGANTLY THROUGH THE LAND  AGAINST  ALL  TRUTH AND REASON  AND SAID     WHO IS SUPERIOR TO US IN STRENGTH     WHAT   DID THEY NOT SEE THAT GOD  WHO CREATED THEM  WAS SUPERIOR TO THEM IN STRENGTH   BUT THEY CONTINUED TO REJECT OUR SIGNS  
   SO WE SENT AGAINST THEM A FURIOUS WIND THROUGH DAYS OF DISASTER  THAT WE MIGHT GIVE THEM A TASTE OF A PENALTY OF HUMILIATION IN THIS LIFE   BUT THE PENALTY OF A HEREAFTER WILL BE MORE HUMILIATING STILL   AND THEY WILL FIND NO HELP 
   AS TO THE THAMŪD  WE GAVE THEM GUIDANCE  BUT THEY PREFERRED BLINDNESS  OF HEART  TO GUIDANCE   SO THE STUNNING PUNISHMENT OF HUMILIATION SEIZED THEM  BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY HAD EARNED 
   BUT WE DELIVERED THOSE WHO BELIEVED AND PRACTICED RIGHTEOUSNESS SECTION  
   ON THE DAY THAT THE ENEMIES OF GOD WILL BE GATHERED TOGETHER TO THE FIRE  THEY WILL BE MARCHED IN RANKS 
   AT LENGTH  WHEN THEY REACH THE  FIRE   THEIR HEARING  THEIR SIGHT  AND THEIR SKINS WILL BEAR WITNESS AGAINST THEM  AS TO  ALL  THEIR DEEDS 
   THEY WILL SAY TO THEIR SKINS     WHY BEAR YE WITNESS AGAINST US     THEY WILL SAY     GOD HATH GIVEN US SPEECH   HE  WHO GIVETH SPEECH TO EVERYTHING   HE CREATED YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME  AND UNTO HIM WERE YE TO RETURN 
     YE DID NOT SEEK TO HIDE YOURSELVES  LEST YOUR HEARING  YOUR SIGHT  AND YOUR SKINS SHOULD BEAR WITNESS AGAINST YOU   BUT YE DID THINK THAT GOD KNEW NOT MANY OF THE THINGS THAT YE USED TO DO  
     BUT THIS THOUGHT OF YOURS WHICH YE DID ENTERTAIN CONCERNING YOUR LORD  HATH BROUGHT YOU TO DESTRUCTION  AND  NOW  HAVE YE BECOME OF THOSE UTTERLY LOST    
   IF  THEN  THEY HAVE PATIENCE  THE FIRE WILL BE A HOME FOR THEM   AND IF THEY BEG TO BE RECEIVED INTO FAVOUR  INTO FAVOUR WILL THEY NOT  THEN  BE RECEIVED 
   AND WE HAVE DESTINED FOR THEM INTIMATE COMPANIONS  OF LIKE NATURE   WHO MADE ALLURING TO THEM WHAT WAS BEFORE THEM AND BEHIND THEM   AND THE SENTENCE AMONG THE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF JINNS AND MEN  WHO HAVE PASSED AWAY  IS PROVED AGAINST THEM   FOR THEY ARE UTTERLY LOST SECTION  
   THE UNBELIEVERS SAY     LISTEN NOT TO THIS QUR ĀN  BUT TALK AT RANDOM IN THE MIDST OF ITS  READING   THAT YE MAY GAIN THE UPPER HAND    
   BUT WE WILL CERTAINLY GIVE THE UNBELIEVERS A TASTE OF A SEVERE PENALTY  AND WE WILL REQUITE THEM FOR THE WORST OF THEIR DEEDS 
   SUCH IS THE REQUITAL OF THE ENEMIES OF GOD  THE FIRE   THEREIN WILL BE FOR THEM THE ETERNAL HOME   A  FIT  REQUITAL  FOR THAT THEY WERE WONT TO REJECT OUR SIGNS 
   AND THE UNBELIEVERS WILL SAY     OUR LORD   SHOW US THOSE  AMONG JINNS AND MEN  WHO MISLED US   WE SHALL CRUSH THEM BENEATH OUR FEET  SO THAT THEY BECOME THE VILEST  BEFORE ALL    
   IN THE CASE OF THOSE WHO SAY    OUR LORD IS GOD    AND  FURTHER  STAND STRAIGHT AND STEADFAST  THE ANGELS DESCEND ON THEM  FROM TIME TO TIME      FEAR YE NOT      THEY SUGGEST     NOR GRIEVE   BUT RECEIVE THE GLAD TIDINGS OF THE GARDEN  OF BLISS   THE WHICH YE WERE PROMISED  
     WE ARE YOUR PROTECTORS IN THIS LIFE AND IN THE HEREAFTER   THEREIN SHALL YE HAVE ALL THAT YOUR SOULS SHALL DESIRE   THEREIN SHALL YE HAVE ALL THAT YE ASK FOR   
     A HOSPITABLE GIFT FROM ONE OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL    SECTION  
   WHO IS BETTER IN SPEECH THAN ONE WHO CALLS  MEN  TO GOD  WORKS RIGHTEOUSNESS  AND SAYS    I AM OF THOSE WHO BOW IN ISLAM    
   NOR CAN GOODNESS AND EVIL BE EQUAL  REPEL  EVIL  WITH WHAT IS BETTER   THEN WILL HE BETWEEN WHOM AND THEE WAS HATRED BECOME AS IT WERE THY FRIEND AND INTIMATE  
   AND NO ONE WILL BE GRANTED SUCH GOODNESS EXCEPT THOSE WHO EXERCISE PATIENCE AND SELF RESTRAINT  NONE BUT PERSONS OF THE GREATEST GOOD FORTUNE 
   AND IF  AT ANY TIME  AN INCITEMENT TO DISCORD IS MADE TO THEE BY THE EVIL ONE  SEEK REFUGE IN GOD  HE IS THE ONE WHO HEARS AND KNOWS ALL THINGS 
   AMONG HIS SIGNS ARE THE NIGHT AND THE DAY  AND THE SUN AND THE MOON  ADORE NOT THE SUN AND THE MOON  BUT ADORE GOD  WHO CREATED THEM  IF IT IS HIM YE WISH TO SERVE 
   BUT IF THEY  UNBELIEVERS  ARE ARROGANT   NO MATTER    FOR IN THE PRESENCE OF THY LORD ARE THOSE WHO CELEBRATE HIS PRAISES BY NIGHT AND BY DAY  AND THEY NEVER FLAG  NOR FEEL THEMSELVES ABOVE IT  
   AND AMONG HIS SIGNS IN THIS   THOU SEEST THE EARTH BARREN AND DESOLATE   BUT WHEN WE SEND DOWN RAIN TO IT  IT IS STIRRED TO LIFE AND YIELDS INCREASE  TRULY  HE WHO GIVES LIFE TO THE  DEAD  EARTH CAN SURELY GIVE LIFE TO  MEN  WHO ARE DEAD  FOR HE HAS POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   THOSE WHO PERVERT THE TRUTH IN OUR SIGNS ARE NOT HIDDEN FROM US  WHICH IS BETTER   HE THAT IS CAST INTO THE FIRE  OR HE THAT COMES SAFE THROUGH ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT   DO WHAT YE WILL   VERILY HE SEETH  CLEARLY  ALL THAT YE DO 
   THOSE WHO REJECT THE MESSAGE WHEN IT COMES TO THEM  ARE NOT HIDDEN FROM US   AND INDEED IT IS A BOOK OF EXALTED POWER 
   NO FALSEHOOD CAN APPROACH IT FROM BEFORE OR BEHIND IT   IT IS SENT DOWN BY ONE FULL OF WISDOM  WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE 
   NOTHING IS SAID TO THEE THAT WAS NOT SAID TO THE APOSTLES BEFORE THEE   THAT THY LORD HAS AT HIS COMMAND  ALL  FORGIVENESS AS WELL AS A MOST GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   HAD WE SENT THIS AS A QUR ĀN  IN A LANGUAGE  OTHER THAN ARABIC  THEY WOULD HAVE SAID     WHY ARE NOT ITS VERSES EXPLAINED IN DETAIL   WHAT    A BOOK  NOT IN ARABIC AND  A MESSENGER  AN ARAB     SAY     IT IS A GUIDE AND A HEALING TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE   AND FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT  THERE IS A DEAFNESS IN THEIR EARS  AND IT IS BLINDNESS IN THEIR  EYES    THEY ARE  AS IT WERE  BEING CALLED FROM A PLACE FAR DISTANT    SECTION  
   WE CERTAINLY GAVE MOSES THE BOOK AFORETIME   BUT DISPUTES AROSE THEREIN  HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR A WORD THAT WENT FORTH BEFORE FROM THY LORD   THEIR DIFFERENCES  WOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED BETWEEN THEM   BUT THEY REMAINED IN SUSPICIOUS DISQUIETING DOUBT THEREON 
   WHOEVER WORKS RIGHTEOUSNESS BENEFITS HIS OWN SOUL   WHOEVER WORKS EVIL  IT IS AGAINST HIS OWN SOUL   NOR IS THY LORD EVER UNJUST  IN THE LEAST  TO HIS SERVANTS 
   TO HIM IS REFERRED THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOUR  OF JUDGMENT   HE KNOWS ALL    NO DATE FRUIT COMES OUT OF ITS SHEATH NOR DOES A FEMALE CONCEIVE  WITHIN HER WOMB  NOR BRING FORTH  YOUNG   BUT BY HIS KNOWLEDGE  THE DAY THAT  GOD  WILL PROPOUND TO THEM THE  QUESTION     WHERE ARE THE PARTNERS  YE ATTRIBUTED  TO ME     THEY WILL SAY    WE DO ASSURE THEE NOT ONE OF US CAN BEAR WITNESS    
   THE  DEITIES  THEY USED TO INVOKE AFORETIME WILL LEAVE THEM IN THE LURCH  AND THEY WILL PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAVE NO WAY OF ESCAPE 
   MAN DOES NOT WEARY OF ASKING FOR GOOD  THINGS   BUT IF ILL TOUCHES HIM  HE GIVES UP ALL HOPE  AND  IS LOST IN DESPAIR 
   WHEN WE GIVE HIM A TASTE OF SOME MERCY FROM OURSELVES  AFTER SOME ADVERSITY HAS TOUCHED HIM  HE IS SURE TO SAY    THIS IS DUE TO MY  MERIT    I THINK NOT THAT THE HOUR  OF JUDGMENT  WILL  EVER  BE ESTABLISHED   BUT IF I AM BROUGHT BACK TO MY LORD  I HAVE  MUCH  GOOD  STORED  IN HIS SIGHT     BUT WE WILL SHOW THE UNBELIEVERS THE TRUTH OF ALL THAT THEY DID  AND WE SHALL GIVE THEM THE TASTE OF A SEVERE PENALTY 
   WHEN WE BESTOW FAVOURS ON MAN  HE TURNS AWAY  AND GETS HIMSELF REMOTE ON HIS SIDE  INSTEAD OF COMING TO US    AND WHEN EVIL SEIZES HIM   HE COMES  FULL OF PROLONGED PRAYER  
   SAY     SEE YE IF THE  REVELATION  IS  REALLY  FROM GOD  AND YET DO YE REJECT IT   WHO IS MORE ASTRAY THAN ONE WHO IS IN A SCHISM FAR  FROM ANY PURPOSE     
   SOON WILL WE SHOW THEM OUR SIGNS IN THE  FURTHEST  REGIONS  OF THE EARTH   AND IN THEIR OWN SOULS  UNTIL IT BECOMES MANIFEST TO THEM THAT THIS IS THE TRUTH  IS IT NOT ENOUGH THAT THY LORD DOTH WITNESS ALL THINGS  
   AH INDEED   ARE THEY IN DOUBT CONCERNING THE MEETING WITH THEIR LORD   AH INDEED   IT IS HE THAT DOTH ENCOMPASS ALL THINGS  
   HĀ MĪM  
    AIN  SĪN  KĀF 
   THUS DOTH  HE  SEND INSPIRATION TO THEE AS  HE DID  TO THOSE BEFORE THEE   GOD  EXALTED IN POWER  FULL OF WISDOM 
   TO HIM BELONGS ALL THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   AND HE IS MOST HIGH  MOST GREAT 
   THE HEAVENS ARE ALMOST RENT ASUNDER FROM ABOVE THEM  BY HIS GLORY    AND THE ANGELS CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF THEIR LORD  AND PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS FOR  ALL  BEINGS ON EARTH   BEHOLD   VERILY GOD IS HE  THE OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   AND THOSE WHO TAKE AS PROTECTORS OTHERS BESIDES HIM   GOD DOTH WATCH OVER THEM   AND THOU ART NOT THE DISPOSER OF THEIR AFFAIRS 
   THUS HAVE WE SENT BY INSPIRATION TO THEE AN ARABIC QUR ĀN   THAT THOU MAYEST WARN THE MOTHER OF CITIES AND ALL AROUND HER   AND WARN  THEM  OF THE DAY OF ASSEMBLY  OF WHICH THERE IS NO DOUBT    WHEN  SOME WILL BE IN THE GARDEN  AND SOME IN THE BLAZING FIRE 
   IF GOD HAD SO WILLED  HE COULD HAVE MADE THEM A SINGLE PEOPLE   BUT HE ADMITS WHOM HE WILL TO HIS MERCY   AND THE WRONG DOERS WILL HAVE NO PROTECTOR NOR HELPER 
   WHAT   HAVE THEY TAKEN  FOR WORSHIP  PROTECTORS BESIDES HIM   BUT IT IS GOD  HE IS THE PROTECTOR  AND IT IS HE WHO GIVES LIFE TO THE DEAD   IT IS HE WHO HAS POWER OVER ALL THINGS SECTION  
   WHATEVER IT BE WHEREIN YE DIFFER  THE DECISION THEREOF IS WITH GOD   SUCH IS GOD MY LORD   IN HIM I TRUST  AND TO HIM I TURN 
    HE IS  THE CREATOR OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   HE HAS MADE FOR YOU PAIRS FROM AMONG YOURSELVES  AND PAIRS AMONG CATTLE   BY THIS MEANS DOES HE MULTIPLY YOU   THERE IS NOTHING WHATEVER LIKE UNTO HIM  AND HE IS THE ONE THAT HEARS AND SEES  ALL THINGS  
   TO HIM BELONG THE KEYS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   HE ENLARGES AND RESTRICTS  THE SUSTENANCE TO WHOM HE WILL   FOR HE KNOWS FULL WELL ALL THINGS 
   THE SAME RELIGION HAS HE ESTABLISHED FOR YOU AS THAT WHICH HE ENJOINED ON NOAH THE WHICH WE HAVE SENT BY INSPIRATION TO THEE AND THAT WHICH WE ENJOINED ON ABRAHAM  MOSES  AND JESUS   NAMELY  THAT YE SHOULD REMAIN STEADFAST IN RELIGION  AND MAKE NO DIVISIONS THEREIN   TO THOSE WHO WORSHIP OTHER THINGS THAN GOD  HARD IS THE  WAY  TO WHICH THOU CALLEST THEM  GOD CHOOSES TO HIMSELF THOSE WHOM HE PLEASES  AND GUIDES TO HIMSELF THOSE WHO TURN  TO HIM  
   AND THEY BECAME DIVIDED ONLY AFTER KNOWLEDGE REACHED THEM  THROUGH SELFISH ENVY AS BETWEEN THEMSELVES  HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR A WORD THAT WENT FORTH BEFORE FROM THY LORD   TENDING  TO A TERM APPOINTED  THE MATTER WOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED BETWEEN THEM   BUT TRULY THOSE WHO HAVE INHERITED THE BOOK AFTER THEM ARE IN SUSPICIOUS  DISQUIETING  DOUBT CONCERNING IT 
   NOW THEN  FOR THAT  REASON   CALL  THEM TO THE FAITH   AND STAND STEADFAST AS THOU ART COMMANDED  NOR FOLLOW THOU THEIR VAIN DESIRES   BUT SAY     I BELIEVE IN THE BOOK WHICH GOD HAS SENT DOWN   AND I AM COMMANDED TO JUDGE JUSTLY BETWEEN YOU  GOD IS OUR LORD AND YOUR LORD  FOR US  IS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR  OUR DEEDS  AND FOR YOU FOR YOUR DEEDS  THERE IS NO CONTENTION BETWEEN US AND YOU  GOD WILL BRING US TOGETHER  AND TO HIM IS  OUR  FINAL GOAL 
   BUT THOSE WHO DISPUTE CONCERNING GOD AFTER HE HAS BEEN ACCEPTED   FUTILE IS THEIR DISPUTE IN THE SIGHT OF THEIR LORD   ON THEM IS WRATH AND FOR THEM WILL BE A PENALTY TERRIBLE 
   IT IS GOD WHO HAS SENT DOWN THE BOOK IN TRUTH  AND THE BALANCE  BY WHICH TO WEIGH CONDUCT   AND WHAT WILL MAKE THEE REALISE THAT PERHAPS THE HOUR IS CLOSE AT HAND  
   ONLY THOSE WISH TO HASTEN IT WHO BELIEVE NOT IN IT   THOSE WHO BELIEVE HOLD IT IN AWE  AND KNOW THAT IT IS THE TRUTH  BEHOLD  VERILY THOSE THAT DISPUTE CONCERNING THE HOUR ARE FAR ASTRAY 
   GRACIOUS IS GOD TO HIS SERVANTS   HE GIVES SUSTENANCE TO WHOM HE PLEASES   AND HE HAS POWER AND CAN CARRY OUT HIS WILL SECTION  
   TO ANY THAT DESIRES THE TILTH OF THE HEREAFTER  WE GIVE INCREASE IN HIS TILTH   AND TO ANY THAT DESIRES THE TILTH OF THIS WORLD  WE GRANT SOMEWHAT THEREOF  BUT HE HAS NO SHARE OR LOT IN THE HEREAFTER 
   WHAT   HAVE THEY PARTNERS  IN GODHEAD   WHO HAVE ESTABLISHED FOR THEM SOME RELIGION WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF GOD   HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE DECREE OF JUDGEMENT  THE MATTER WOULD HAVE BEEN DECIDED BETWEEN THEM  AT ONCE   BUT VERILY THE WRONG DOERS WILL HAVE A GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   THOU WILT SEE THE WRONG DOERS IN FEAR ON ACCOUNT OF WHAT THEY HAVE EARNED  AND  THE BURDEN OF  THAT MUST  NECESSARILY  FALL ON THEM  BUT THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUS DEEDS WILL BE IN THE LUXURIANT MEADS OF THE GARDENS   THEY SHALL HAVE  BEFORE THEIR LORD  ALL THAT THEY WISH FOR  THAT WILL INDEED BE THE MAGNIFICENT BOUNTY  OF GOD  
   THAT IS  THE BOUNTY  WHEREOF GOD GIVES GLAD TIDINGS TO HIS SERVANTS WHO BELIEVE AND DO RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  SAY     NO REWARD DO I ASK OF YOU FOR THIS EXCEPT THE LOVE OF THOSE NEAR OF KIN    AND IF ANY ONE EARNS ANY GOOD  WE SHALL GIVE HIM AN INCREASE OF GOOD IN RESPECT THEREOF   FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST READY TO APPRECIATE  SERVICE  
   WHAT   DO THEY SAY    HE HAS FORGED A FALSEHOOD AGAINST GOD     BUT IF GOD WILLED  HE COULD SEAL UP THY HEART  AND GOD BLOTS OUT VANITY  AND PROVES THE TRUTH BY HIS WORDS  FOR HE KNOWS WELL THE SECRETS OF ALL HEARTS 
   HE IS THE ONE THAT ACCEPTS REPENTANCE FROM HIS SERVANTS AND FORGIVES SINS   AND HE KNOWS ALL THAT YE DO 
   AND HE LISTENS TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND DO DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  AND GIVES THEM INCREASE OF HIS BOUNTY   BUT FOR THE UNBELIEVERS THERE IS A TERRIBLE PENALTY 
   IF GOD WERE TO ENLARGE THE PROVISION FOR HIS SERVANTS  THEY WOULD INDEED TRANSGRESS BEYOND ALL BOUNDS THROUGH THE EARTH   BUT HE SENDS  IT  DOWN IN DUE MEASURE AS HE PLEASES   FOR HE IS WITH HIS SERVANTS WELL ACQUAINTED  WATCHFUL 
   HE IS THE ONE THAT SENDS DOWN RAIN  EVEN  AFTER  MEN  HAVE GIVEN UP ALL HOPE  AND SCATTERS HIS MERCY  FAR AND WIDE   AND HE IS THE PROTECTOR  WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE 
   AND AMONG HIS SIGNS IS THE CREATION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND THE LIVING CREATURES THAT HE HAS SCATTERED THROUGH THEM   AND HE HAS POWER TO GATHER THEM TOGETHER WHEN HE WILLS SECTION  
   WHATEVER MISFORTUNE HAPPENS TO YOU  IS BECAUSE OF THE THINGS YOUR HANDS HAVE WROUGHT AND FOR MANY  OF THEM  HE GRANTS FORGIVENESS 
   NOR CAN YE FRUSTRATE  AUGHT    FLEEING  THROUGH THE EARTH   NOR HAVE YE BESIDES GOD ANY ONE TO PROTECT OR TO HELP 
   AND AMONG HIS SIGNS ARE THE SHIPS  SMOOTH RUNNING THROUGH THE OCEAN   TALL  AS MOUNTAINS 
   IF IT BE HIS WILL  HE CAN STILL THE WIND   THEN WOULD THEY BECOME MOTIONLESS ON THE BACK OF THE  OCEAN   VERILY IN THIS ARE SIGNS FOR EVERYONE WHO PATIENTLY PERSEVERES AND IS GRATEFUL 
   OR HE CAN CAUSE THEM TO PERISH BECAUSE OF THE  EVIL  WHICH  THE MEN  HAVE EARNED   BUT MUCH DOTH HE FORGIVE 
   BUT LET THOSE KNOW  WHO DISPUTE ABOUT OUR SIGNS  THAT THERE IS FOR THEM NO WAY OF ESCAPE 
   WHATEVER YE ARE GIVEN  HERE  IS  BUT  A CONVENIENCE OF THIS LIFE   BUT THAT WHICH IS WITH GOD IS BETTER AND MORE LASTING    IT IS  FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND PUT THEIR TRUST IN THEIR LORD  
   THOSE WHO AVOID THE GREATER CRIMES AND SHAMEFUL DEEDS  AND  WHEN THEY ARE ANGRY EVEN THEN FORGIVE  
   THOSE WHO HEARKEN TO THEIR LORD  AND ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER   WHO  CONDUCT  THEIR AFFAIRS BY MUTUAL CONSULTATION   WHO SPEND OUT OF WHAT WE BESTOW ON THEM FOR SUSTENANCE  
   AND THOSE WHO  WHEN AN OPPRESSIVE WRONG IS INFLICTED ON THEM   ARE NOT COWED BUT  HELP AND DEFEND THEMSELVES 
   THE RECOMPENSE FOR AN INJURY IS AN INJURY EQUAL THERETO  IN DEGREE    BUT IF A PERSON FORGIVES AND MAKES RECONCILIATION  HIS REWARD IS DUE FROM GOD   FOR  GOD  LOVETH NOT THOSE WHO DO WRONG 
   BUT INDEED IF ANY DO HELP AND DEFEND THEMSELVES AFTER A WRONG  DONE  TO THEM  AGAINST SUCH THERE IS NO CAUSE OF BLAME 
   THE BLAME IS ONLY AGAINST THOSE WHO OPPRESS MEN WITH WRONG DOING AND INSOLENTLY TRANSGRESS BEYOND BOUNDS THROUGH THE LAND  DEFYING RIGHT AND JUSTICE   FOR SUCH THERE WILL BE A PENALTY GRIEVOUS 
   BUT INDEED IF ANY SHOW PATIENCE AND FORGIVE  THAT WOULD TRULY BE AN EXERCISE OF COURAGEOUS WILL AND RESOLUTION IN THE CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS SECTION  
   FOR ANY WHOM GOD LEAVES ASTRAY  THERE IS NO PROTECTOR THEREAFTER  AND THOU WILT SEE THE WRONG DOERS  WHEN IN SIGHT OF THE PENALTY  SAY     IS THERE ANY WAY  TO EFFECT  A RETURN    
   AND THOU WILT SEE THEM BROUGHT FORWARD TO THE  PENALTY   IN A HUMBLE FRAME OF MIND BECAUSE OF  THEIR  DISGRACE   AND  LOOKING WITH A STEALTHY GLANCE  AND THE BELIEVERS WILL SAY     THOSE ARE INDEED IN LOSS WHO HAVE GIVEN TO PERDITION THEIR OWN SELVES AND THOSE BELONGING TO THEM ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT  BEHOLD   TRULY THE WRONG DOERS ARE IN A LASTING PENALTY    
   AND NO PROTECTORS HAVE THEY TO HELP THEM  OTHER THAN GOD  AND FOR ANY WHOM GOD LEAVES TO STRAY  THERE IS NO WAY  TO THE GOAL  
   HEARKEN YE TO YOUR LORD  BEFORE THERE COME A DAY WHICH THERE WILL BE NO PUTTING BACK  BECAUSE OF  THE ORDAINMENT OF  GOD   THAT DAY THERE WILL BE FOR YOU NO PLACE OF REFUGE NOR WILL THERE BE FOR YOU ANY ROOM FOR DENIAL  OF YOUR SINS   
   IF THEN THEY TURN AWAY  WE HAVE NOT SENT THEE AS A GUARD OVER THEM  THY DUTY IS BUT TO CONVEY  THE MESSAGE   AND TRULY  WHEN WE GIVE MAN A TASTE OF A MERCY FROM OURSELVES  HE DOTH EXULT THEREAT  BUT WHEN SOME ILL HAPPENS TO HIM  ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEEDS WHICH HIS HANDS HAVE SENT FORTH  TRULY THEN IS MAN UNGRATEFUL  
   TO GOD BELONGS THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  HE CREATES WHAT HE WILLS  AND PLANS   HE BESTOWS  CHILDREN  MALE OR FEMALE ACCORDING TO HIS WILL  AND PLAN  
   OR HE BESTOWS BOTH MALES AND FEMALES  AND HE LEAVES BARREN WHOM HE WILL   FOR HE IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND POWER 
   IT IS NOT FITTING FOR A MAN THAT GOD SHOULD SPEAK TO HIM EXCEPT BY INSPIRATION  OR FROM BEHIND A VEIL  OR BY THE SENDING OF A MESSENGER TO REVEAL  WITH GOD S PERMISSION  WHAT GOD WILLS   FOR HE IS MOST HIGH  MOST WISE 
   AND THUS HAVE WE  BY OUR COMMAND  SENT INSPIRATION TO THEE   THOU KNOWEST NOT  BEFORE  WHAT WAS REVELATION  AND WHAT WAS FAITH   BUT WE HAVE MADE THE  QUR ĀN  A LIGHT  WHEREWITH WE GUIDE SUCH OF OUR SERVANTS AS WE WILL   AND VERILY THOU DOST GUIDE  MEN  TO THE STRAIGHT WAY  
   THE WAY OF GOD  TO WHOM BELONGS WHATEVER IS IN THE HEAVENS AND WHATEVER IS ON EARTH  BEHOLD  HOW  ALL AFFAIRS TEND TOWARDS GOD  
   HA MĪM 
   BY THE BOOK THAT MAKES THINGS CLEAR  
   WE HAVE MADE IT A QUR ĀN IN ARABIC  THAT YE MAY BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND  AND LEARN WISDOM  
   AND VERILY  IT IS IN THE MOTHER OF THE BOOK  IN OUR PRESENCE  HIGH  IN DIGNITY   FULL OF WISDOM 
   SHALL WE THEN TAKE AWAY THE MESSAGE FROM YOU AND REPEL  YOU   FOR THAT YE ARE A PEOPLE TRANSGRESSING BEYOND BOUNDS  
   BUT HOW MANY WERE THE PROPHETS WE SENT AMONGST THE PEOPLES OF OLD  
   AND NEVER CAME THERE A PROPHET TO THEM BUT THEY MOCKED HIM 
   SO WE DESTROYED  THEM  STRONGER IN POWER THAN THESE   AND  THUS  HAS PASSED ON THE PARABLE OF THE PEOPLES OF OLD 
   IF THOU WERT TO QUESTION THEM    WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH     THEY WOULD BE SURE TO REPLY    THEY WERE CREATED BY  HIM   THE EXALTED IN POWER  FULL OF KNOWLEDGE     
    YEA  THE SAME THAT  HAS MADE FOR YOU THE EARTH  LIKE A CARPET  SPREAD OUT  AND HAS MADE FOR YOU ROADS  AND CHANNELS  THEREIN  IN ORDER THAT YE MAY FIND GUIDANCE  ON THE WAY   
   THAT SENDS DOWN  FROM TIME TO TIME  RAIN FROM THE SKY IN DUE MEASURE    AND WE RAISE TO LIFE THEREWITH A LAND THAT IS DEAD   EVEN SO WILL YE BE RAISED  FROM THE DEAD    
   THAT HAS CREATED PAIRS IN ALL THINGS  AND HAS MADE FOR YOU SHIPS AND CATTLE ON WHICH YE RIDE 
   IN ORDER THAT YE MAY SIT FIRM AND SQUARE ON THEIR BACKS  AND WHEN SO SEATED  YE MAY CELEBRATE THE  KIND  FAVOUR OF YOUR LORD  AND SAY    GLORY TO HIM WHO HAS SUBJECTED THESE TO OUR  USE   FOR WE COULD NEVER HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS  BY OURSELVES  
     AND TO OUR LORD  SURELY  MUST WE TURN BACK    
   YET THEY ATTRIBUTE TO SOME OF HIS SERVANTS A SHARE WITH HIM  IN HIS GODHEAD    TRULY IS MAN A BLASPHEMOUS INGRATE AVOWED  SECTION  
   WHAT   HAS HE TAKEN DAUGHTERS OUT OF WHAT HE HIMSELF CREATES  AND GRANTED TO YOU SONS FOR CHOICE  
   WHEN NEWS IS BROUGHT TO ONE OF THEM OF  THE BIRTH OF  WHAT HE SETS UP AS A LIKENESS TO  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  HIS FACE DARKENS  AND HE IS FILLED WITH INWARD GRIEF  
   IS THEN ONE BROUGHT UP AMONG TRINKETS  AND UNABLE TO GIVE A CLEAR ACCOUNT IN A DISPUTE  TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH GOD   
   AND THEY MAKE INTO FEMALES ANGELS WHO THEMSELVES SERVE GOD  DID THEY WITNESS THEIR CREATION   THEIR EVIDENCE WILL BE RECORDED  AND THEY WILL BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT  
      AH      THEY SAY    IF IT HAD BEEN THE WILL OF  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  WE SHOULD NOT HAVE WORSHIPPED SUCH  DEITIES      OF THAT THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE   THEY DO NOTHING BUT LIE  
   WHAT   HAVE WE GIVEN THEM A BOOK BEFORE THIS  TO WHICH THEY ARE HOLDING FAST  
   NAY   THEY SAY     WE FOUND OUR FATHERS FOLLOWING A CERTAIN RELIGION  AND WE DO GUIDE OURSELVES BY THEIR FOOTSTEPS   
   JUST IN THE SAME WAY  WHENEVER WE SENT A WARNER BEFORE THEE TO ANY PEOPLE  THE WEALTHY ONES AMONG THEM SAID     WE FOUND OUR FATHERS FOLLOWING A CERTAIN RELIGION  AND WE WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS   
   HE SAID     WHAT   EVEN IF I BROUGHT YOU BETTER GUIDANCE THAN THAT WHICH YE FOUND YOUR FATHERS FOLLOWING     THEY SAID     FOR US  WE DENY THAT YE  PROPHETS  ARE SENT  ON A MISSION AT ALL    
   SO WE EXACTED RETRIBUTION FROM THEM   NOW SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE WHO REJECTED  TRUTH   SECTION  
   BEHOLD   ABRAHAM SAID TO HIS FATHER AND HIS PEOPLE     I DO INDEED CLEAR MYSELF OF WHAT YE WORSHIP  
      I WORSHIP  ONLY HIM WHO MADE ME  AND HE WILL CERTAINLY GUIDE ME   
   AND HE LEFT IT AS A WORD TO ENDURE AMONG THOSE WHO CAME AFTER HIM  THAT THEY MAY TURN BACK  TO GOD  
   YEA  I HAVE GIVEN THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS LIFE TO THESE  MEN  AND THEIR FATHERS  UNTIL THE TRUTH HAS COME TO THEM  AND AN APOSTLE MAKING THINGS CLEAR 
   BUT WHEN THE TRUTH CAME TO THEM  THEY SAID     THIS IS SORCERY  AND WE DO REJECT IT   
   ALSO  THEY SAY     WHY IS NOT THIS QUR ĀN SENT DOWN TO SOME LEADING MAN IN EITHER OF THE TWO  CHIEF  CITIES    
   IS IT THEY WHO WOULD PORTION OUT THE MERCY OF THY LORD   IT IS WE WHO PORTION OUT BETWEEN THEM THEIR LIVELIHOOD IN THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD   AND WE RAISE SOME OF THEM ABOVE OTHERS IN RANKS  SO THAT SOME MAY COMMAND WORK FROM OTHERS  BUT THE MERCY OF THY LORD IS BETTER THAN THE  WEALTH  WHICH THEY AMASS 
   AND WERE IT NOT THAT  ALL  MEN MIGHT BECOME OF ONE  EVIL  WAY OF LIFE  WE WOULD PROVIDE  FOR EVERYONE THAT BLASPHEMES AGAINST  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  SILVER ROOFS FOR THEIR HOUSES  AND  SILVER  STAIR WAYS ON WHICH TO GO UP 
   AND  SILVER  DOORS TO THEIR HOUSES  AND THRONES  OF SILVER  ON WHICH THEY COULD RECLINE 
   AND ALSO ADORNMENTS OF GOLD  BUT ALL THIS WERE NOTHING BUT CONVENIENCES OF THE PRESENT LIFE   THE HEREAFTER  IN THE SIGHT OF THY LORD  IS FOR THE RIGHTEOUS SECTION  
   IF ANYONE WITHDRAWS HIMSELF FROM REMEMBRANCE OF  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  WE APPOINT FOR HIM AN EVIL ONE  TO BE AN INTIMATE COMPANION TO HIM 
   SUCH  EVIL ONES  REALLY HINDER THEM FROM THE PATH  BUT THEY THINK THAT THEY ARE BEING GUIDED ARIGHT  
   AT LENGTH  WHEN  SUCH A ONE  COMES TO US  HE SAYS  TO HIS EVIL COMPANION      WOULD THAT BETWEEN ME AND THEE WERE THE DISTANCE OF EAST AND WEST     AH   EVIL IS THE COMPANION  INDEED   
   WHEN YE HAVE DONE WRONG  IT WILL AVAIL YOU NOTHING  THAT DAY  THAT YE SHALL BE PARTNERS IN PUNISHMENT  
   CANST THOU THEN MAKE THE DEAF TO HEAR  OR GIVE DIRECTION TO THE BLIND OR TO SUCH AS  WANDER  IN MANIFEST ERROR  
   EVEN IF WE TAKE THEE AWAY  WE SHALL BE SURE TO EXACT RETRIBUTION FROM THEM 
   OR WE SHALL SHOW THEE THAT  ACCOMPLISHED  WHICH WE HAVE PROMISED THEM   FOR VERILY WE SHALL PREVAIL OVER THEM 
   SO HOLD THOU FAST TO THE REVELATION SENT DOWN TO THEE   VERILY THOU ART ON STRAIGHT WAY 
   THE  QUR ĀN  IS INDEED THE MESSAGE  FOR THEE AND FOR THY PEOPLE   AND SOON SHALL YE  ALL  BE BROUGHT TO ACCOUNT 
   AND QUESTION THOU OUR APOSTLES WHOM WE SENT BEFORE THEE   DID WE APPOINT ANY DEITIES OTHER THAN  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  TO BE WORSHIPPED  SECTION  
   WE DID SEND MOSES AFORETIME  WITH OUR SIGNS  TO PHARAOH AND HIS CHIEFS   HE SAID    I AM AN APOSTLE OF THE LORD OF THE WORLDS   
   BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THEM WITH OUR SIGNS  BEHOLD  THEY RIDICULED THEM 
   WE SHOWED THEM SIGN AFTER SIGN  EACH GRATER THAN ITS FELLOW  AND WE SEIZED THEM WITH PUNISHMENT  IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT TURN  TO US  
   AND THEY SAID    O THOU SORCERER   INVOKE THY LORD FOR US ACCORDING TO HIS COVENANT WITH THEE   FOR WE SHALL TRULY ACCEPT GUIDANCE   
   BUT WHEN WE REMOVED THE PENALTY FROM THEM  BEHOLD  THEY BROKE THEIR WORD 
   AND PHARAOH PROCLAIMED AMONG HIS PEOPLE  SAYING     O MY PEOPLE   DOES NOT THE DOMINION OF EGYPT BELONG TO ME   WITNESS  THESE STREAMS FLOWING UNDERNEATH MY  PALACE    WHAT   SEE YE NOT THEN  
     AM I NOT BETTER THAN THIS  MOSES   WHO IS A CONTEMPTIBLE WRETCH AND CAN SCARCELY EXPRESS HIMSELF CLEARLY  
     THEN WHY ARE NOT GOLD BRACELETS BESTOWED ON HIM  OR  WHY  COME  NOT  WITH HIM ANGELS ACCOMPANYING HIM IN PROCESSION    
   THUS DID HE MAKE FOOLS OF HIS PEOPLE  AND THEY OBEYED HIM   TRULY WERE THEY A PEOPLE REBELLIOUS  AGAINST GOD  
   WHEN AT LENGTH THEY PROVOKED US  WE EXACTED RETRIBUTION FROM THEM  AND WE DROWNED THEM ALL 
   AND WE MADE THEM  A PEOPLE  OF THE PAST AND AN EXAMPLE TO LATER AGES SECTION  
   WHEN  JESUS  THE SON OF MARY IS HELD UP AS AN EXAMPLE  BEHOLD  THY PEOPLE RAISE A CLAMOUR THEREAT  IN RIDICULE   
   AND THEY SAY    ARE OUR GODS BEST  OR HE     THIS THEY SET FORTH TO THEE  ONLY BY WAY OF DISPUTATION   YEA  THEY ARE A CONTENTIOUS PEOPLE 
   HE WAS NO MORE THAN A SERVANT   WE GRANTED OUR FAVOUR TO HIM  AND WE MADE HIM AN EXAMPLE TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL 
   AND IF IT WERE OUR WILL  WE COULD MAKE ANGELS FROM AMONGST YOU  SUCCEEDING EACH OTHER ON THE EARTH 
   AND  JESUS  SHALL BE A SIGN  FOR THE COMING OF  THE HOUR  OF JUDGMENT    THEREFORE HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE  HOUR   BUT FOLLOW YE ME   THIS IS A STRAIGHT WAY 
   LET NOT THE EVIL ONE HINDER YOU   FOR HE IS TO YOU AN ENEMY AVOWED 
   WHEN JESUS CAME WITH CLEAR SIGNS  HE SAID     NOW HAVE I COME TO YOU WITH WISDOM  AND IN ORDER TO MAKE CLEAR TO YOU SOME OF THE  POINTS  ON WHICH YE DISPUTE   THEREFORE FEAR GOD AND OBEY ME 
     FOR GOD  HE IS MY LORD AND YOUR LORD   SO WORSHIP YE HIM   THIS IS A STRAIGHT WAY   
   BUT SECTS FROM AMONG THEMSELVES FELL INTO DISAGREEMENT   THEN WOE TO THE WRONG DOERS  FROM THE PENALTY OF A GRIEVOUS DAY  
   DO THEY ONLY WAIT FOR THE HOUR THAT IT SHOULD COME ON THEM ALL OF A SUDDEN  WHILE THEY PERCEIVE NOT  
   FRIENDS ON THAT DAY WILL BE FOES  ONE TO ANOTHER  EXCEPT THE RIGHTEOUS SECTION  
   MY DEVOTEES   NO FEAR SHALL BE ON YOU THAT DAY  NOR SHALL YE GRIEVE  
    BEING  THOSE WHO HAVE BELIEVED IN OUR SIGNS AND BOWED  THEIR WILLS TO OURS  IN ISLĀM 
   ENTER YE THE GARDEN  YE AND YOUR WIVES  IN  BEAUTY AND  REJOICING 
   TO THEM WILL BE PASSED ROUND  DISHES AND GOBLETS OF GOLD   THERE WILL BE THERE ALL THAT THE SOULS COULD DESIRE  ALL THAT THE EYES COULD DELIGHT IN   AND YE SHALL ABIDE THEREIN  FOR AYE  
   SUCH WILL BE THE GARDEN OF WHICH YE ARE MADE HEIRS FOR YOUR  GOOD  DEEDS  IN LIFE  
   YE SHALL HAVE THEREIN ABUNDANCE OF FRUIT  FROM WHICH YE SHALL HAVE SATISFACTION 
   THE SINNERS WILL BE IN THE PUNISHMENT OF HELL  TO DWELL THEREIN  FOR AYE   
   NOWISE WILL THE  PUNISHMENT  BE LIGHTENED FOR THEM  AND IN DESPAIR WILL THEY BE THERE OVERWHELMED 
   NOWISE SHALL WE BE UNJUST TO THEM   BUT IT IS THEY WHO HAVE BEEN UNJUST THEMSELVES 
   THEY WILL CRY     O MĀLIK   WOULD THAT THY LORD PUT AND END TO US     HE WILL SAY    NAY  BUT YE SHALL ABIDE    
   VERILY WE HAVE BROUGHT THE TRUTH TO YOU   BUT MOST OF YOU HAVE A HATRED FOR TRUTH 
   WHAT   HAVE THEY SETTLED SOME PLAN  AMONG THEMSELVES    BUT IT IS WE WHO SETTLE THINGS 
   OR DO THEY THINK THAT WE HEAR NOT THEIR SECRETS AND THEIR PRIVATE COUNSELS   INDEED  WE DO   AND OUR MESSENGERS ARE BY THEM  TO RECORD 
   SAY     IF  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS HAD A SON  I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO WORSHIP   
   GLORY TO THE LORD OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  THE LORD OF THE THRONE  OF AUTHORITY     HE IS FREE  FROM THE THINGS THEY ATTRIBUTE  TO HIM   
   SO LEAVE THEM TO BABBLE AND PLAY  WITH VANITIES  UNTIL THEY MEET THAT DAY OF THEIRS  WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN PROMISED 
   IT IS HE WHO IS GOD IN HEAVEN AND GOD ON EARTH   AND HE IS FULL OF WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE 
   AND BLESSED IS HE TO WHOM BELONGS THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND ALL BETWEEN THEM   WITH HIM IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOUR  OF JUDGMENT    AND TO HIM SHALL YE BE BROUGHT BACK 
   AND THOSE WHOM THEY INVOKE BESIDES GOD HAVE NO POWER OF INTERCESSION   ONLY HE WHO BEARS WITNESS TO THE TRUTH  AND THEY KNOW  HIM  
   IF THOU ASK THEM  WHO CREATED THEM  THEY WILL CERTAINLY SAY  GOD   HOW THEN ARE THEY DELUDED AWAY  FROM THE TRUTH   
    GOD HAS KNOWLEDGE  OF THE  PROPHET S  CRY    O MY LORD   TRULY THESE ARE A PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT BELIEVE    
   BUT TURN AWAY FROM THEM  AND SAY   PEACE     BUT SOON SHALL THEY KNOW  
   HĀ MĪM 
   BY THE BOOK THAT MAKES THINGS CLEAR   
   WE SENT IT DOWN DURING A BLESSED NIGHT   FOR WE  EVER  WISH TO WARN  AGAINST EVIL  
   IN THAT  NIGHT  IS MADE DISTINCT EVERY AFFAIR OF WISDOM 
   BY COMMAND  FROM OUR PRESENCE  FOR WE  EVER  SEND  REVELATIONS  
   AS A MERCY FROM THY LORD   FOR HE HEARS AND KNOWS  ALL THINGS   
   THE LORD OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL BETWEEN THEM  IF YE  BUT  HAVE AN ASSURED FAITH 
   THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE   IT IS HE WHO GIVES LIFE AND GIVES DEATH   THE LORD AND CHERISHER TO YOU AND YOUR EARLIEST ANCESTORS 
   YET THEY PLAY ABOUT IN DOUBT 
   THEN WATCH THOU FOR THE DAY THAT THE SKY WILL BRING FORTH A KIND OF SMOKE  OR MIST  PLAINLY VISIBLE 
   ENVELOPING THE PEOPLE   THIS WILL BE A PENALTY GRIEVOUS 
    THEY WILL SAY &COLON     OUR LORD   REMOVE THE PENALTY FROM US  FOR WE DO REALLY BELIEVE    
   HOW SHALL THE MESSAGE BE  EFFECTUAL  FOR THEM  SEEING THAT AN APOSTLE EXPLAINING THINGS CLEARLY HAS  ALREADY  COME TO THEM  
   YET THEY TURN AWAY FROM HIM AND SAY     TUTORED  BY OTHERS   A MAN POSSESSED    
   WE SHALL INDEED REMOVE THE PENALTY FOR A WHILE   BUT  TRULY YE WILL REVERT  TO YOUR WAYS  
   ONE DAY WE SHALL SEIZE YOU WITH A MIGHTY ONSLAUGHT   WE WILL INDEED  THEN  EXACT RETRIBUTION  
   WE DID  BEFORE THEM  TRY THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH   THERE CAME TO THEM AN APOSTLE MOST HONOURABLE 
   SAYING     RESTORE TO ME THE SERVANTS OF GOD   I AM TO YOU AN APOSTLE WORTHY OF ALL TRUST  
     AND BE NOT ARROGANT AS AGAINST GOD   FOR I COME TO YOU WITH AUTHORITY MANIFEST 
     FOR ME  I HAVE SOUGHT SAFETY WITH MY LORD AND YOUR LORD  AGAINST YOUR INJURING ME 
     IF YE BELIEVE ME NOT  AT LEAST KEEP YOURSELVES AWAY FROM ME   
    BUT THEY WERE AGGRESSIVE &COLON   THEN HE CRIED TO HIS LORD     THESE ARE INDEED A PEOPLE GIVEN TO SIN   
    THE REPLY CAME &COLON     MARCH FORTH WITH MY SERVANTS BY NIGHT   FOR YE ARE SURE TO BE PURSUED 
     AND LEAVE THE SEA AS A FURROW  DIVIDED    FOR THEY ARE A HOST  DESTINED  TO BE DROWNED   
   HOW MANY WERE THE GARDENS AND SPRINGS THEY LEFT BEHIND 
   AND CORN FIELDS AND NOBLE BUILDINGS 
   AND WEALTH  AND CONVENIENCES OF LIFE   WHEREIN THEY HAD TAKEN SUCH DELIGHT  
   THUS  WAS THEIR END    AND WE MADE OTHER PEOPLE INHERIT  THOSE THINGS   
   AND NEITHER HEAVEN NOR EARTH SHED A TEAR OVER THEM   NOR WERE THEY GIVEN A RESPITE  AGAIN  SECTION  
   WE DID DELIVER AFORETIME THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL FROM HUMILIATING PUNISHMENT 
   INFLICTED BY PHARAOH  FOR HE WAS ARROGANT  EVEN  AMONG INORDINATE TRANSGRESSORS 
   AND WE CHOSE THEM AFORETIME ABOVE THE NATIONS  KNOWINGLY 
   AND GRANTED THEM SIGNS IN WHICH THERE WAS A MANIFEST TRIAL 
   AS TO THESE  QURAISH   THEY SAY FORSOOTH  
     THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND OUR FIRST DEATH  AND WE SHALL NOT BE RAISED AGAIN 
     THEN BRING  BACK  OUR FOREFATHERS  IF WHAT YE SAY IS TRUE    
   WHAT   ARE THEY BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE OF TUBBA  AND THOSE WHO WERE BEFORE THEM  WE DESTROYED THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE GUILTY OF SIN 
   WE CREATED NOT THE HEAVENS  THE EARTH  AND ALL BETWEEN THEM  MERELY IN  IDLE  SPORT  
   WE CREATED THEM NOT EXCEPT FOR JUST ENDS   BUT MOST OF THEM DO NOT UNDERSTAND 
   VERILY THE DAY OF SORTING OUT IS THE TIME APPOINTED FOR ALL OF THEM  
   THE DAY WHEN NO PROTECTOR CAN AVAIL HIS CLIENT IN AUGHT  AND NO HELP CAN THEY RECEIVE 
   EXCEPT SUCH AS RECEIVE GOD S MERCY   FOR HE IS EXALTED IN MIGHT  MOST MERCIFUL SECTION  
   VERILY THE TREE OF ZAQQŪM
   WILL BE THE FOOD OF THE SINFUL  
   LIKE MOLTEN BRASS   IT WILL BOIL IN THEIR INSIDES 
   LIKE THE BOILING OF SCALDING WATER 
    A VOICE WILL CRY     SEIZE YE HIM AND DRAG HIM INTO THE MIDST OF THE BLAZING FIRE  
     THEN POUR OVER HIS HEAD THE PENALTY OF BOILING WATER
     TASTE THOU  THIS    TRULY WAST THOU MIGHTY  FULL OF HONOUR  
     TRULY THIS IS WHAT YE USED TO DOUBT    
   AS TO THE RIGHTEOUS  THEY WILL BE  IN A POSITION OF SECURITY 
   AMONG GARDENS AND SPRINGS  
   DRESSED IN FINE SILK AND IN RICH BROCADE  THEY WILL FACE EACH OTHER  
   SO   AND WE SHALL JOIN THEM TO COMPANIONS WITH BEAUTIFUL  BIG  AND LUSTROUS EYES 
   THERE CAN THEY CALL FOR EVERY KIND OF FRUIT IN PEACE AND SECURITY  
   NOR WILL THEY THERE TASTE DEATH  EXCEPT THE FIRST DEATH   AND HE WILL PRESERVE THEM FROM THE PENALTY OF THE BLAZING FIRE  
   AS A BOUNTY FROM THY LORD   THAT WILL BE THE SUPREME ACHIEVEMENT  
   VERILY  WE HAVE MADE THIS  QUR ĀN  EASY  IN THY TONGUE  IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY GIVE HEED 
   SO WAIT THOU AND WATCH   FOR THEY  TOO  ARE WAITING 
   HĀ MĪM 
   THE REVELATION OF THE BOOK IS FROM GOD THE EXALTED IN POWER  FULL OF WISDOM 
   VERILY IN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE 
   AND IN THE CREATION OF YOURSELVES AND THE FACT THAT ANIMALS ARE SCATTERED  THROUGH THE EARTH   ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE OF ASSURED FAITH 
   AND IN THE ALTERNATION OF NIGHT AND DAY  AND THE FACT THAT GOD SENDS DOWN SUSTENANCE FROM THE SKY  AND REVIVES THEREWITH THE EARTH AFTER ITS DEATH  AND THE CHANGE OF THE WINDS  ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE THAT ARE WISE 
   SUCH ARE THE SIGNS OF GOD  WHICH WE REHEARSE TO THEE IN TRUTH   THEN IN WHAT EXPOSITION WILL THEY BELIEVE AFTER  REJECTING  GOD AND HIS SIGNS  
   WOE TO EACH SINFUL DEALER IN FALSEHOODS  
   HE HEARS THE SIGNS OF GOD REHEARSED TO HIM  YET IS OBSTINATE AND LOFTY  AS IF HE HAD NOT HEARD THEM   THEN ANNOUNCE TO HIM A PENALTY GRIEVOUS  
   AND WHEN HE LEARNS SOMETHING OF OUR SIGNS  HE TAKES THEM IN JEST   FOR SUCH THERE WILL BE A HUMILIATING PENALTY 
   IN FRONT OF THEM IS HELL   AND OF NO PROFIT TO THEM IS ANYTHING THEY MAY HAVE EARNED  NOR ANY PROTECTORS THEY MAY HAVE TAKEN TO THEMSELVES BESIDES GOD   FOR THEM IS A TREMENDOUS PENALTY 
   THIS IS  TRUE  GUIDANCE   AND FOR THOSE WHO REJECT THE SIGNS OF THEIR LORD  IS A GRIEVOUS PENALTY OF ABOMINATION SECTION  
   IT IS GOD WHO HAS SUBJECTED THE SEA TO YOU  THAT SHIPS MAY SAIL THROUGH IT BY HIS COMMAND  THAT YE MAY SEEK OF HIS BOUNTY  AND THAT YE MAY BE GRATEFUL 
   AND HE HAS SUBJECTED TO YOU  AS FROM HIM  ALL THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   BEHOLD  IN THAT ARE SIGNS INDEED FOR THOSE WHO REFLECT 
   TELL THOSE WHO BELIEVE  TO FORGIVE THOSE WHO DO NOT LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAYS OF GOD   IT IS FOR HIM TO RECOMPENSE  FOR GOOD OR ILL  EACH PEOPLE ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY HAVE EARNED 
   IF ANY ONE DOES A RIGHTEOUS DEED IT ENURES TO THE BENEFIT OF HIS OWN SOUL   IF HE DOES EVIL  IT WORKS AGAINST  HIS OWN SOUL   IN THE END WILL YE  ALL  BE BROUGHT BACK TO YOUR LORD 
   WE DID AFORETIME GRANT TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THE BOOK  THE POWER OF COMMAND  AND PROPHETHOOD   WE GAVE THEM  FOR SUSTENANCE  THINGS GOOD AND PURE   AND WE FAVOURED THEM ABOVE THE NATIONS 
   AND WE GRANTED THEM CLEAR SIGNS IN AFFAIRS  OF RELIGION    IT WAS ONLY AFTER KNOWLEDGE HAD BEEN GRANTED TO THEM THAT THEY FELL INTO SCHISMS  THROUGH INSOLENT ENVY AMONG THEMSELVES  VERILY THY LORD WILL JUDGE BETWEEN THEM ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT AS TO THOSE MATTERS IN WHICH THEY SET UP DIFFERENCES 
   THEN WE PUT THEE ON THE  RIGHT  WAY OF RELIGION   SO FOLLOW THOU THAT  WAY   AND FOLLOW NOT THE DESIRES OF THOSE WHO KNOW NOT 
   THEY WILL BE OF NO USE TO THEE IN THE SIGHT OF GOD   IT IS ONLY WRONG DOERS  THAT STAND AS  PROTECTORS  ONE TO ANOTHER   BUT GOD IS THE PROTECTOR OF THE RIGHTEOUS 
   THESE ARE CLEAR EVIDENCES TO MEN  AND A GUIDANCE AND MERCY TO THOSE OF ASSURED FAITH 
   WHAT   DO THOSE WHO SEEK AFTER EVIL WAYS THINK THAT WE SHALL HOLD THEM EQUAL WITH THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND DO RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  THAT EQUAL WILL BE THEIR LIFE AND THEIR DEATH   ILL IS THE JUDGMENT THAT THEY MAKE SECTION  
   GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH FOR JUST ENDS  AND IN ORDER THAT EACH SOUL MAY FIND THE RECOMPENSE OF WHAT IT HAS EARNED  AND NONE OF THEM BE WRONGED 
   THEN SEEST THOU SUCH A ONE AS TAKES AS HIS GOD HIS OWN VAIN DESIRE   GOD HAS  KNOWING  HIM AS SUCH   LEFT HIM ASTRAY  AND SEALED HIS HEARING AND HIS HEART  AND UNDERSTANDING   AND PUT A COVER ON HIS SIGHT  WHO  THEN  WILL GUIDE HIM AFTER GOD  HAS WITHDRAWN GUIDANCE    WILL YE NOT THEN RECEIVE ADMONITION  
   AND THEY SAY     WHAT IS THERE BUT OUR LIFE IN THIS WORLD   WE SHALL DIE AND WE LIVE  AND NOTHING BUT TIME CAN DESTROY US    BUT OF THAT THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE   THEY MERELY CONJECTURE  
   AND WHEN OUR CLEAR SIGNS ARE REHEARSED TO THEM  THEIR ARGUMENT IS NOTHING BUT THIS   THEY SAY    BRING  BACK  OUR FOREFATHERS  IF WHAT YE SAY IS TRUE    
   SAY     IT IS GOD WHO GIVES YOU LIFE  THEN GIVES YOU DEATH   THEN HE WILL GATHER YOU TOGETHER FOR THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT ABOUT WHICH THERE IS NO DOUBT     BUT MOST MEN DO NOT UNDERSTAND SECTION  
   TO GOD BELONGS THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND THE DAY THAT THE HOUR OF JUDGMENT IS ESTABLISHED  THAT DAY WILL THE DEALERS IN FALSEHOOD PERISH  
   AND THOU WILT SEE EVERY SECT BOWING THE KNEE   EVERY SECT WILL BE CALLED TO ITS RECORD     THIS DAY SHALL YE BE RECOMPENSED FOR ALL THAT YE DID  
     THIS OUR RECORD SPEAKS ABOUT YOU WITH TRUTH   FOR WE WERE WONT TO PUT ON RECORD ALL THAT YE DID   
   THEN  AS TO THOSE WHO BELIEVED AND DID RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  THEIR LORD WILL ADMIT THEM TO HIS MERCY   THAT WILL BE THE ACHIEVEMENT FOR ALL TO SEE 
   BUT AS TO THOSE WHO REJECTED GOD   TO THEM WILL BE SAID      WERE NOT OUR SIGNS REHEARSED TO YOU   BUT YE WERE ARROGANT  AND WERE A PEOPLE GIVEN TO SIN  
     AND WHEN IT WAS SAID THAT THE PROMISE OF GOD WAS TRUE  AND THAT THE HOUR THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT ITS  COMING   YE USED TO SAY    WE KNOW NOT WHAT IS THE HOUR   WE ONLY THINK IT IS AN IDEA  AND WE HAVE NO FIRM ASSURANCE     
   THEN WILL APPEAR TO THEM THE EVIL  FRUITS  OF WHAT THEY DID  AND THEY WILL BE COMPLETELY ENCIRCLED BY THAT WHICH THEY USED TO MOCK AT  
   IT WILL ALSO BE SAID     THIS DAY WE WILL FORGET YOU AS YE FORGOT THE MEETING OF THIS DAY OF YOURS   AND YOUR ABODE IS THE FIRE  AND NO HELPERS HAVE YE  
     THIS  BECAUSE YE USED TO TAKE THE SIGNS OF GOD IN JEST  AND THE LIFE OF THE WORLD DECEIVED YOU      FROM  THE DAY  THEREFORE  THEY SHALL NOT BE TAKEN OUT THENCE  NOR SHALL THEY BE RECEIVED INTO GRACE 
   THEN PRAISE BE TO GOD  LORD OF THE HEAVENS AND LORD OF THE EARTH  LORD AND CHERISHER OF ALL THE WORLDS  
   TO HIM BE GLORY THROUGHOUT THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   AND HE IS EXALTED IN POWER  FULL OF WISDOM  
   HĀ MĪM 
   THE REVELATION OF THE BOOK IS FROM GOD THE EXALTED IN POWER  FULL OF WISDOM 
   WE CREATED NOT THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL BETWEEN THEM BUT FOR JUST ENDS  AND FOR A TERM APPOINTED   BUT THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH TURN AWAY FROM THAT WHEREOF THEY ARE WARNED 
   SAY    DO YE SEE WHAT IT IS YE INVOKE BESIDES GOD   SHOW ME WHAT IT IS THEY HAVE CREATED ON EARTH  OR HAVE THEY A SHARE IN THE HEAVENS   BRING ME A BOOK  REVEALED  BEFORE THIS  OR ANY REMNANT OF KNOWLEDGE  YE MAY HAVE   IF YE ARE TELLING THE TRUTH  
   AND WHO IS MORE ASTRAY THAN ONE WHO INVOKES  BESIDES GOD  SUCH AS WILL NOT ANSWER HIM TO THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT  AND WHO  IN FACT  ARE UNCONSCIOUS OF THEIR CALL  TO THEM   
   AND WHEN MANKIND ARE GATHERED TOGETHER  AT THE RESURRECTION   THEY WILL BE HOSTILE TO THEM AND REJECT THEIR WORSHIP  ALTOGETHER   
   WHEN OUR CLEAR SIGNS ARE REHEARSED TO THEM  THE UNBELIEVERS SAY  OF THE TRUTH WHEN IT COMES TO THEM     THIS IS EVIDENT SORCERY    
   OR DO THEY SAY    HE HAS FORGED IT     SAY     HAD I FORGED IT  THEN CAN YE OBTAIN NO SINGLE  BLESSING  FOR ME FROM GOD  HE KNOWS BEST OF THAT WHEREOF YE TALK  SO GLIBLY    ENOUGH IS HE FOR A WITNESS BETWEEN ME AND YOU   AND HE IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL   
   SAY     I AM NO BRINGER OF NEW FANGLED DOCTRINE AMONG THE APOSTLES  NOR DO I KNOW WHAT WILL BE DONE WITH ME OR WITH YOU  I FOLLOW BUT THAT WHICH IS REVEALED TO ME BY INSPIRATION   I AM BUT A WARNER OPEN AND CLEAR   
   SAY     SEE YE   IF  THIS TEACHING  BE FROM GOD  AND YE REJECT IT  AND A WITNESS FROM AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TESTIFIES TO ITS SIMILARITY  WITH EARLIER SCRIPTURES   AND HAS BELIEVED WHILE YE ARE ARROGANT  HOW UNJUST YE ARE    TRULY  GOD GUIDES NOT A PEOPLE UNJUST   SECTION  
   THE UNBELIEVERS SAY OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE     IF  THIS MESSAGE  WERE A GOOD THING   SUCH MEN  WOULD NOT HAVE GONE TO IT FIRST  BEFORE US     AND SEEING THAT THEY GUIDE NOT THEMSELVES THEREBY  THEY WILL SAY    THIS IS AN  OLD   OLD FALSEHOOD    
   AND BEFORE THIS  WAS THE BOOK OF MOSES AS A GUIDE AND A MERCY   AND THIS BOOK CONFIRMS  IT  IN THE ARABIC TONGUE   TO ADMONISH THE UNJUST  AND AS GLAD TIDINGS TO THOSE WHO DO RIGHT 
   VERILY THOSE WHO SAY    OUR LORD IS GOD    AND REMAIN FIRM  ON THAT PATH    ON THEM SHALL BE NO FEAR  NOR SHALL THEY GRIEVE 
   SUCH SHALL BE COMPANIONS OF THE GARDEN  DWELLING THEREIN  FOR AYE    A RECOMPENSE FOR THEIR  GOOD  DEEDS 
   WE HAVE ENJOINED ON MAN KINDNESS TO HIS PARENTS   IN PAIN DID HIS MOTHER BEAR HIM  AND IN PAIN DID SHE GIVE HIM BIRTH  THE CARRYING OF THE  CHILD  TO HIS WEANING IS  A PERIOD OF  THIRTY MONTHS  AT LENGTH  WHEN HE REACHES THE AGE OF FULL STRENGTH AND ATTAINS FORTY YEARS  HE SAYS   O MY LORD  GRANT ME THAT I MAY BE GRATEFUL FOR THY FAVOUR WHICH THOU HAST BESTOWED UPON ME  AND UPON BOTH MY PARENTS  AND THAT I MAY WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS SUCH AS THOU MAYEST APPROVE   AND BE GRACIOUS TO ME IN MY ISSUE  TRULY HAVE I TURNED TO THEE AND TRULY DO I BOW  TO THEE  IN ISLAM   
   SUCH ARE THEY FROM WHOM WE SHALL ACCEPT THE BEST OF THEIR DEEDS AND PASS BY THEIR ILL DEEDS    THEY SHALL BE  AMONG THE COMPANIONS OF THE GARDEN   A PROMISE OF TRUTH  WHICH WAS MADE TO THEM  IN THIS LIFE  
   BUT  THERE IS ONE  WHO SAYS TO HIS PARENTS    FIE ON YOU   DO YE HOLD OUT THE PROMISE TO ME THAT I SHALL BE RAISED UP  EVEN THOUGH GENERATIONS HAVE PASSED BEFORE ME  WITHOUT RISING AGAIN      AND THEY TWO SEEK GOD S AID   AND REBUKE THE SON      WOE TO THEE   HAVE FAITH   FOR THE PROMISE OF GOD IS TRUE    BUT HE SAYS    THIS IS NOTHING BUT TALES OF THE ANCIENTS    
   SUCH ARE THEY AGAINST WHOM IS PROVED THE SENTENCE AMONG THE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF JINNS AND MEN  THAT HAVE PASSED AWAY   FOR THEY WILL BE  UTTERLY  LOST 
   AND TO ALL ARE  ASSIGNED  DEGREES ACCORDING TO THE DEEDS WHICH THEY  HAVE DONE   AND IN ORDER THAT  GOD  MAY RECOMPENSE THEIR DEEDS  AND NO INJUSTICE BE DONE TO THEM 
   AND ON THE DAY THAT THE UNBELIEVERS WILL BE PLACED BEFORE THE FIRE   IT WILL BE SAID TO THEM      YE RECEIVED YOUR GOOD THINGS IN THE LIFE OF THE WORLD  AND YE TOOK YOUR PLEASURE OUT OF THEM   BUT TO DAY SHALL YE BE RECOMPENSED WITH A PENALTY OF HUMILIATION   FOR THAT YE WERE ARROGANT ON EARTH WITHOUT JUST CAUSE  AND THAT YE  EVER  TRANSGRESSED   SECTION  
   MENTION  HŪD  ONE OF  ĀD S  OWN  BRETHREN   BEHOLD  HE WARNED HIS PEOPLE ABOUT THE WINDING SAND TRACTS   BUT THERE HAVE BEEN WARNERS BEFORE HIM AND AFTER HIM     WORSHIP YE NONE OTHER THAN GOD   TRULY I FEAR FOR YOU THE PENALTY OF A MIGHTY DAY   
   THEY SAID     HAST THOU COME IN ORDER TO TURN US ASIDE FROM OUR GODS   THEN BRING UPON US THE  CALAMITY  WITH WHICH THOU DOST THREATEN US  IF THOU ART TELLING THE TRUTH    
   HE SAID     THE KNOWLEDGE  OF WHEN IT WILL COME  IS ONLY WITH GOD   I PROCLAIM TO YOU THE MISSION ON WHICH I HAVE BEEN SENT   BUT I SEE THAT YE ARE A PEOPLE IN IGNORANCE      
   THEN  WHEN THEY SAW THE  PENALTY IN THE SHAPE OF  A CLOUD TRAVERSING THE SKY  COMING TO MEET THEIR VALLEYS  THEY SAID    THIS CLOUD WILL GIVE US RAIN       NAY  IT IS THE  CALAMITY  YE WERE ASKING TO BE HASTENED    A WIND WHEREIN IS A GRIEVOUS PENALTY  
     EVERYTHING WILL IT DESTROY BY THE COMMAND OF ITS LORD     THEN BY THE MORNING THEY  NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT  THE RUINS OF  THEIR HOUSES   THUS DO WE RECOMPENSE THOSE GIVEN TO SIN  
   AND WE HAD FIRMLY ESTABLISHED THEM IN A  PROSPERITY AND  POWER WHICH WE HAVE NOT GIVEN TO YOU  YE QURAISH    AND WE HAD ENDOWED THEM WITH  FACULTIES OF  HEARING  SEEING  HEART AND INTELLECT   BUT OF NO PROFIT TO THEM WERE THEIR  FACULTIES OF  HEARING  SIGHT  AND HEART AND INTELLECT  WHEN THEY WENT ON REJECTING THE SIGNS OF GOD   AND THEY WERE  COMPLETELY  ENCIRCLED BY THAT WHICH THEY USED TO MOCK AT  SECTION  
   WE DESTROYED AFORETIME POPULATIONS ROUND ABOUT YOU   AND WE HAVE SHOWN THE SIGNS IN VARIOUS WAYS  THAT THEY MAY TURN  TO US  
   WHY THEN WAS NO HELP FORTHCOMING TO THEM FROM THOSE WHOM THEY WORSHIPPED AS GODS  BESIDES GOD  AS A MEANS OF ACCESS  TO GOD    NAY  THEY LEFT THEM IN THE LURCH   BUT THAT WAS THEIR FALSEHOOD AND THEIR INVENTION 
   BEHOLD  WE TURNED TOWARDS THEE A COMPANY OF JINNS  QUIETLY  LISTENING TO THE QUR ĀN   WHEN THEY STOOD IN THE PRESENCE THEREOF  THEY SAID    LISTEN IN SILENCE     WHEN THE  READING  WAS FINISHED  THEY RETURNED TO THEIR PEOPLE  TO WARN  THEM OF THEIR SINS  
   THEY SAID    O OUR PEOPLE   WE HAVE HEARD A BOOK REVEALED AFTER MOSES  CONFIRMING WHAT CAME BEFORE IT   IT GUIDES  MEN  TO THE TRUTH AND TO A STRAIGHT PATH 
     O OUR PEOPLE  HEARKEN TO THE ONE WHO INVITES  YOU  TO GOD  AND BELIEVE IN HIM   HE WILL FORGIVE YOU YOUR FAULTS  AND DELIVER YOU FROM A PENALTY GRIEVOUS 
     IF ANY DOES NOT HEARKEN TO THE ONE WHO INVITES  US  TO GOD  HE CANNOT FRUSTRATE  GOD S PLAN  ON EARTH  AND NO PROTECTORS CAN HE HAVE BESIDES GOD   SUCH MEN  WANDER  IN MANIFEST ERROR   
   SEE THEY NOT THAT GOD  WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND NEVER WEARIED WITH THEIR CREATION  IS ABLE TO GIVE LIFE TO THE DEAD   YEA  VERILY HE HAS POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   AND ON THE DAY THAT THE UNBELIEVERS WILL BE PLACED BEFORE THE FIRE   THEY WILL BE ASKED     IS THIS NOT THE TRUTH     THEY WILL SAY    YEA  BY OUR LORD      ONE WILL SAY &COLON     THEN TASTE YE THE PENALTY  FOR THAT YE WERE WONT TO DENY  TRUTH     
   THEREFORE PATIENTLY PERSEVERE  AS DID  ALL  APOSTLES OF INFLEXIBLE PURPOSE   AND BE IN NO HASTE ABOUT THE  UNBELIEVERS   ON THE DAY THAT THEY SEE THE  PUNISHMENT  PROMISED THEM   IT WILL BE  AS IF THEY HAD NOT TARRIED MORE THAN AN HOUR IN A SINGLE DAY   THINE BUT  TO PROCLAIM THE MESSAGE   BUT SHALL ANY BE DESTROYED EXCEPT THOSE WHO TRANSGRESS  
   THOSE WHO REJECT GOD AND HINDER  MEN  FROM THE PATH OF GOD  THEIR DEEDS WILL GOD RENDER ASTRAY  FROM THEIR MARK  
   BUT THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK DEEDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  AND BELIEVE IN THE  REVELATION  SENT DOWN TO MUHAMMAD FOR IT IS THE TRUTH FROM THEIR LORD  HE WILL REMOVE FROM THEM THEIR ILLS AND IMPROVE THEIR CONDITION 
   THIS BECAUSE THOSE WHO REJECT GOD FOLLOW VANITIES  WHILE THOSE WHO BELIEVE FOLLOW THE TRUTH FROM THEIR LORD   THUS DOES GOD SET FORTH FOR MEN THEIR LESSONS BY SIMILITUDES 
   THEREFORE  WHEN YE MEET THE UNBELIEVERS  IN FIGHT   SMITE AT THEIR NECKS   AT LENGTH  WHEN YE HAVE THOROUGHLY SUBDUED THEM  BIND A BOND FIRMLY  ON THEM    THEREAFTER  IS THE TIME FOR  EITHER GENEROSITY OR RANSOM   UNTIL THE WAR LAYS DOWN ITS BURDENS  THUS  ARE YE COMMANDED    BUT IF IT HAD BEEN GOD S WILL  HE COULD CERTAINLY HAVE EXACTED RETRIBUTION FROM THEM  HIMSELF    BUT  HE LETS YOU FIGHT  IN ORDER TO TEST YOU  SOME WITH OTHERS  BUT THOSE WHO ARE SLAIN IN THE WAY OF GOD  HE WILL NEVER LET THEIR DEEDS BE LOST 
   SOON WILL HE GUIDE THEM AND IMPROVE THEIR CONDITION 
   AND ADMIT THEM TO THE GARDEN WHICH HE HAS ANNOUNCED FOR THEM 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   IF YE WILL AID  THE CAUSE OF  GOD  HE WILL AID YOU  AND PLANT YOUR FEET FIRMLY 
   BUT THOSE WHO REJECT  GOD   FOR THEM IS DESTRUCTION  AND  GOD  WILL RENDER THEIR DEEDS ASTRAY  FROM THEIR MARK  
   THAT IS BECAUSE THEY HATE THE REVELATION OF GOD   SO HE HAS MADE THEIR DEEDS FRUITLESS 
   DO THEY NOT TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH  AND SEE WHAT WAS THE END OF THOSE BEFORE THEM  WHO DID EVIL    GOD BROUGHT UTTER DESTRUCTION ON THEM  AND SIMILAR  FATES AWAIT  THOSE WHO REJECT GOD 
   THAT IS BECAUSE GOD IS THE PROTECTOR OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE  BUT THOSE WHO REJECT GOD HAVE NO PROTECTOR SECTION  
   VERILY GOD WILL ADMIT THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND DO RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  TO GARDENS BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW   WHILE THOSE WHO REJECT GOD WILL ENJOY  THIS WORLD  AND EAT AS CATTLE EAT   AND THE FIRE WILL BE THEIR ABODE 
   AND HOW MANY CITIES  WITH MORE POWER THAN THY CITY WHICH HAS DRIVEN THEE OUT  HAVE WE DESTROYED  FOR THEIR SINS    AND THERE WAS NONE TO AID THEM 
   IS THEN ONE WHO IS ON A CLEAR  PATH  FROM HIS LORD  NO BETTER THAN ONE TO WHOM THE EVIL OF HIS CONDUCT SEEMS PLEASING  AND SUCH AS FOLLOW THEIR OWN LUSTS  
    HERE IS  A PARABLE OF THE GARDEN WHICH THE RIGHTEOUS ARE PROMISED   IN IT ARE RIVERS OF WATER INCORRUPTIBLE   RIVERS OF MILK OF WHICH THE TASTE NEVER CHANGES   RIVERS OF WINE  A JOY TO THOSE WHO DRINK   AND RIVERS OF HONEY PURE AND CLEAR  IN IT THERE ARE FOR THEM ALL KINDS OF FRUITS   AND GRACE FROM THEIR LORD   CAN THOSE IN SUCH BLISS  BE COMPARED TO SUCH AS SHALL DWELL FOR EVER IN THE FIRE  AND BE GIVEN  TO DRINK  BOILING WATER  SO THAT IT CUTS UP THEIR BOWELS  TO PIECES   
   AND AMONG THEM ARE MEN WHO LISTEN TO THEE  BUT IN THE END  WHEN THEY GO OUT FROM THEE  THEY SAY TO THOSE WHO HAVE RECEIVED KNOWLEDGE    WHAT IS IT HE SAID JUST THEN     SUCH ARE MEN WHOSE HEARTS GOD HAS SEALED  AND WHO FOLLOW THEIR OWN LUSTS 
   BUT TO THOSE WHO RECEIVE GUIDANCE  HE INCREASES  THE LIGHT OF  GUIDANCE  AND BESTOWS ON THEM THEIR PIETY AND RESTRAINT  FROM EVIL  
   DO THEY THEN ONLY WAIT FOR THE HOUR  THAT IT SHOULD COME ON THEM OF A SUDDEN   BUT ALREADY HAVE COME SOME TOKENS THEREOF  AND WHEN IT  ACTUALLY  IS ON THEM  HOW CAN THEY BENEFIT THEN BY THEIR ADMONITION  
   KNOW  THEREFORE  THAT THERE IS NO GOD BUT GOD  AND ASK FORGIVENESS FOR THY FAULT  AND FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE   FOR GOD KNOWS HOW YE MOVE ABOUT AND HOW YE DWELL IN YOUR HOMES SECTION  
   THOSE WHO BELIEVE SAY    WHY IS NOT A SŪRA SENT DOWN  FOR US      BUT WHEN A SŪRA OF BASIC OR CATEGORICAL MEANING IS REVEALED  AND FIGHTING IS MENTIONED THEREIN  THOU WILT SEE THOSE IN WHOSE HEARTS IS A DISEASE LOOKING AT THEE WITH A LOOK OF ONE IN SWOON AT THE APPROACH OF DEATH  BUT MORE FITTING FOR THEM 
   WERE IT TO OBEY AND SAY WHAT IS JUST  AND WHEN A MATTER IS RESOLVED ON  IT WERE BEST FOR THEM IF THEY WERE TRUE TO GOD 
   THEN  IS IT TO BE EXPECTED OF YOU  IF YE WERE PUT IN AUTHORITY  THAT YE WILL DO MISCHIEF IN THE LAND  AND BREAK YOUR TIES OF KITH AND KIN  
   SUCH ARE THE MEN WHOM GOD HAS CURSED FOR HE HAS MADE THEM DEAF AND BLINDED THEIR SIGHT 
   DO THEY NOT THEN EARNESTLY SEEK TO UNDERSTAND THE QUR ĀN  OR ARE THEIR HEARTS LOCKED UP BY THEM 
   THOSE WHO TURN BACK AS APOSTATES AFTER GUIDANCE WAS CLEARLY SHOWN TO THEM  THE EVIL ONE HAS INSTIGATED THEM AND BUOYED THEM UP WITH FALSE HOPES 
   THIS  BECAUSE THEY SAID TO THOSE WHO HATE WHAT GOD HAS REVEALED    WE WILL OBEY YOU IN PART OF  THIS  MATTER     BUT GOD KNOWS THEIR  INNER  SECRETS 
   BUT HOW  WILL IT BE  WHEN THE ANGELS TAKE THEIR SOULS AT DEATH  AND SMITE THEIR FACES AND THEIR BACKS  
   THIS BECAUSE THEY FOLLOWED THAT WHICH CALLED FORTH THE WRATH OF GOD  AND THEY HATED GOD S GOOD PLEASURE   SO HE MADE THEIR DEEDS OF NO EFFECT SECTION  
   OR DO THOSE IN WHOSE HEARTS IS A DISEASE  THINK THAT GOD WILL NOT BRING TO LIGHT ALL THEIR RANCOUR  
   HAD WE SO WILLED  WE COULD HAVE SHOWN THEM UP TO THEE  AND THOU SHOULDST HAVE KNOWN THEM BY THEIR MARKS   BUT SURELY THOU WILT KNOW THEM BY THE TONE OF THEIR SPEECH   AND GOD KNOWS ALL THAT YE DO 
   AND WE SHALL TRY YOU UNTIL WE TEST THOSE AMONG YOU WHO STRIVE THEIR UTMOST AND PERSEVERE IN PATIENCE   AND WE SHALL TRY YOUR REPORTED  METTLE  
   THOSE WHO REJECT GOD  HINDER  MEN  FROM THE PATH OF GOD  AND RESIST THE APOSTLE  AFTER GUIDANCE HAS BEEN CLEARLY SHOWN TO THEM  WILL NOT INJURE GOD IN THE LEAST  BUT HE WILL MAKE THEIR DEEDS OF NO EFFECT 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   OBEY GOD  AND OBEY THE APOSTLE  AND MAKE NOT VAIN YOUR DEEDS  
   THOSE WHO REJECT GOD  AND HINDER  MEN  FROM THE PATH OF GOD  THEN DIE REJECTING GOD  GOD WILL NOT FORGIVE THEM 
   BE NOT WEARY AND FAINT HEARTED  CRYING FOR PEACE  WHEN YE SHOULD BE UPPERMOST   FOR GOD IS WITH YOU  AND WILL NEVER PUT YOU IN LOSS FOR YOUR  GOOD  DEEDS 
   THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD IS BUT PLAY AND AMUSEMENT   AND IF YE BELIEVE AND GUARD AGAINST EVIL  HE WILL GRANT YOU YOUR RECOMPENSE  AND WILL NOT ASK YOU  TO GIVE UP  YOUR POSSESSIONS 
   IF HE WERE TO ASK YOU FOR ALL OF THEM  AND PRESS YOU  YE WOULD COVETOUSLY WITHHOLD  AND HE WOULD BRING OUT ALL YOUR ILL FEELING 
   BEHOLD YE ARE THOSE INVITED TO SPEND  OF YOUR SUBSTANCE  IN THE WAY OF GOD   BUT AMONG YOU ARE SOME THAT ARE NIGGARDLY  BUT ANY WHO ARE NIGGARDLY ARE SO AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR OWN SOULS  BUT GOD IS FREE OF ALL WANTS  AND IT IS YE THAT ARE NEEDY  IF YE TURN BACK  FROM THE PATH   HE WILL SUBSTITUTE IN YOUR STEAD ANOTHER PEOPLE   THEN THEY WOULD NOT BE LIKE YOU  
   VERILY WE HAVE GRANTED THEE A MANIFEST VICTORY  
   THAT GOD MAY FORGIVE THEE THY FAULTS OF THE PAST AND THOSE TO FOLLOW   FULFIL HIS FAVOUR TO THEE   AND GUIDE THEE ON THE STRAIGHT WAY  
   AND THAT GOD MAY HELP THEE WITH POWERFUL HELP 
   IT IS HE WHO SENT DOWN TRANQUILLITY INTO THE HEARTS OF THE BELIEVERS  THAT THEY MAY ADD FAITH TO THEIR FAITH   FOR TO GOD BELONG THE FORCES OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   AND GOD IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM   
   THAT HE MAY ADMIT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE  TO GARDENS BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW  TO DWELL THEREIN FOR AYE  AND REMOVE THEIR ILLS FROM THEM   AND THAT IS  IN THE SIGHT OF GOD  THE HIGHEST ACHIEVEMENT  FOR MAN   
   AND THAT HE MAY PUNISH THE HYPOCRITES  MEN AND WOMEN  AND THE POLYTHEISTS  MEN AND WOMEN  WHO IMAGINE AN EVIL OPINION OF GOD  ON THEM IS A ROUND OF EVIL   THE WRATH OF GOD IS ON THEM   HE HAS CURSED THEM AND GOT HELL READY FOR THEM  AND EVIL IS IT FOR A DESTINATION 
   FOR TO GOD BELONG THE FORCES OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   AND GOD IS EXALTED IN POWER  FULL OF WISDOM 
   WE HAVE TRULY SENT THEE AS A WITNESS  AS A BRINGER OF GLAD TIDINGS  AND AS A WARNER  
   IN ORDER THAT YE  O MEN  MAY BELIEVE IN GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  THAT YE MAY ASSIST AND HONOUR HIM  AND CELEBRATE HIS PRAISES MORNING AND EVENING 
   VERILY THOSE WHO PLIGHT THEIR FEALTY TO THEE DO NO LESS THAN PLIGHT THEIR FEALTY TO GOD   THE HAND OF GOD IS OVER THEIR HANDS   THEN ANY ONE WHO VIOLATES HIS OATH  DOES SO TO THE HARM OF HIS OWN SOUL  AND ANY ONE WHO FULFILS WHAT HE HAS COVENANTED WITH GOD  GOD WILL SOON GRANT HIM A GREAT REWARD SECTION  
   THE DESERT ARABS WHO LAGGED BEHIND WILL SAY TO THEE     WE WERE ENGAGED IN  LOOKING AFTER  OUR FLOCKS AND HERDS  AND OUR FAMILIES   DO THOU THEN ASK FORGIVENESS FOR US    THEY SAY WITH THEIR TONGUES WHAT IS NOT IN THEIR HEARTS  SAY     WHO THEN HAS ANY POWER AT ALL  TO INTERVENE  ON YOUR BEHALF WITH GOD  IF HIS WILL IS TO GIVE YOU SOME LOSS OR TO GIVE YOU SOME PROFIT   BUT GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THAT YE DO 
     NAY  YE THOUGHT THAT THE APOSTLE AND THE BELIEVERS WOULD NEVER RETURN TO THEIR FAMILIES   THIS SEEMED PLEASING IN YOUR HEARTS  AND YE CONCEIVED AN EVIL THOUGHT  FOR YE ARE A PEOPLE LOST  IN WICKEDNESS    
   AND IF ANY BELIEVE NOT IN GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  WE HAVE PREPARED  FOR THOSE WHO REJECT GOD  A BLAZING FIRE  
   TO GOD BELONGS THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   HE FORGIVES WHOM HE WILLS  AND HE PUNISHES WHOM HE WILLS   BUT GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   THOSE WHO LAGGED BEHIND  WILL SAY   WHEN YE  ARE FREE TO  MARCH AND TAKE BOOTY  IN WAR      PERMIT US TO FOLLOW YOU    THEY WISH TO CHANGE GOD S DECREE   SAY     NOT THUS WILL YE FOLLOW US   GOD HAS ALREADY DECLARED  THIS  BEFOREHAND     THEN THEY WILL SAY    BUT YE ARE JEALOUS OF US    NAY  BUT LITTLE DO THEY UNDERSTAND  SUCH THINGS  
   SAY TO THE DESERT ARABS WHO LAGGED BEHIND     YE SHALL BE SUMMONED  TO FIGHT  AGAINST A PEOPLE GIVEN TO VEHEMENT WAR   THEN SHALL YE FIGHT  OR THEY SHALL SUBMIT  THEN IF YE SHOW OBEDIENCE  GOD WILL GRANT YOU A GOODLY REWARD  BUT IF YE TURN BACK AS YE DID BEFORE  HE WILL PUNISH YOU WITH A GRIEVOUS PENALTY   
   NO BLAME IS THERE ON THE BLIND  NOR IS THERE BLAME ON THE LAME  NOR ON ONE ILL  IF HE JOINS NOT THE WAR    BUT HE THAT OBEYS GOD AND HIS APOSTLE   GOD  WILL ADMIT HIM TO GARDENS BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW   AND HE WHO TURNS BACK   GOD  WILL PUNISH HIM WITH A GRIEVOUS PENALTY SECTION  
   GOD S GOOD PLEASURE WAS ON THE BELIEVERS WHEN THEY SWORE FEALTY TO THEE UNDER THE TREE   HE KNEW WHAT WAS IN THEIR HEARTS  AND HE SENT DOWN TRANQUILLITY TO THEM   AND HE REWARDED THEM WITH A SPEEDY VICTORY  
   AND MANY GAINS WILL THEY ACQUIRE  BESIDES    AND GOD IS EXALTED IN POWER  FULL OF WISDOM 
   GOD HAS PROMISED YOU MANY GAINS THAT YE SHALL ACQUIRE  AND HE HAS GIVEN YOU THESE BEFOREHAND   AND HE HAS RESTRAINED THE HANDS OF MEN FROM YOU   THAT IT MAY BE A SIGN FOR THE BELIEVERS  AND THAT HE MAY GUIDE YOU TO A STRAIGHT PATH  
   AND OTHER GAINS  THERE ARE   WHICH ARE NOT WITHIN YOUR POWER  BUT WHICH GOD HAS COMPASSED   AND GOD HAS POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   IF THE UNBELIEVERS SHOULD FIGHT YOU  THEY WOULD CERTAINLY TURN THEIR BACKS   THEN WOULD THEY FIND NEITHER PROTECTOR NOR HELPER 
    SUCH HAS BEEN  THE PRACTICE  APPROVED  OF GOD ALREADY IN THE PAST   NO CHANGE WILT THOU FIND IN THE PRACTICE  APPROVED  OF GOD 
   AND IT IS HE WHO HAS RESTRAINED THEIR HANDS FROM YOU AND YOUR HANDS FROM THEM IN THE MIDST OF MECCA  AFTER THAT HE GAVE YOU THE VICTORY OVER THEM  AND GOD SEES WELL ALL THAT YE DO 
   THEY ARE THE ONES WHO DENIED REVELATION AND HINDERED YOU FROM THE SACRED MOSQUE AND THE SACRIFICIAL ANIMALS  DETAINED FROM REACHING THEIR PLACE OF SACRIFICE  HAD THERE NOT BEEN BELIEVING MEN AND BELIEVING WOMEN WHOM YE DID NOT KNOW THAT YE WERE TRAMPLING DOWN AND ON WHOSE ACCOUNT A CRIME WOULD HAVE ACCRUED TO YOU WITHOUT  YOUR  KNOWLEDGE   GOD WOULD HAVE ALLOWED YOU TO FORCE YOUR WAY  BUT HE HELD BACK YOUR HANDS  THAT HE MAY ADMIT TO HIS MERCY WHOM HE WILL  IF THEY HAD BEEN APART  WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE PUNISHED THE UNBELIEVERS AMONG THEM WITH A GRIEVOUS PUNISHMENT 
   WHILE THE UNBELIEVERS GOT UP IN THEIR HEARTS HEAT AND CANT THE HEAT AND CANT OF IGNORANCE  GOD SENT DOWN HIS TRANQUILLITY TO HIS APOSTLE AND TO THE BELIEVERS  AND MADE THEM STICK CLOSE TO THE COMMAND OF SELF RESTRAINT   AND WELL WERE THEY ENTITLED TO IT AND WORTHY OF IT  AND GOD HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THINGS SECTION  
   TRULY DID GOD FULFIL THE VISION FOR HIS APOSTLE   YE SHALL ENTER THE SACRED MOSQUE  IF GOD WILLS  WITH MINDS SECURE  HEADS SHAVED  HAIR CUT SHORT  AND WITHOUT FEAR  FOR HE KNEW WHAT YE KNEW NOT  AND HE GRANTED  BESIDES THIS  A SPEEDY VICTORY 
   IT IS HE WHO HAS SENT HIS APOSTLE WITH GUIDANCE AND THE RELIGION OF TRUTH  TO PROCLAIM IT OVER ALL RELIGION   AND ENOUGH IS GOD FOR A WITNESS 
   MUHAMMAD IS THE APOSTLE OF GOD   AND THOSE WHO ARE WITH HIM ARE STRONG AGAINST UNBELIEVERS   BUT  COMPASSIONATE AMONGST EACH OTHER  THOU WILT SEE THEM BOW AND PROSTRATE THEMSELVES  IN PRAYER   SEEKING GRACE FROM GOD AND  HIS  GOOD PLEASURE  ON THEIR FACES ARE THEIR MARKS   BEING  THE TRACES OF THEIR PROSTRATION  THIS IS THEIR SIMILITUDE IN THE TAURĀT   AND THEIR SIMILITUDE IN THE GOSPEL IS   LIKE A SEED WHICH SENDS FORTH ITS BLADE  THEN MAKES IT STRONG   IT THEN BECOMES THICK  AND IT STANDS ON ITS OWN STEM   FILLING  THE SOWERS WITH WONDER AND DELIGHT  AS A RESULT  IT FILLS THE UNBELIEVERS WITH RAGE AT THEM  GOD HAS PROMISED THOSE AMONG THEM WHO BELIEVE AND DO RIGHTEOUS DEEDS FORGIVENESS  AND A GREAT REWARD 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   PUT NOT YOURSELVES FORWARD BEFORE GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  BUT FEAR GOD   FOR GOD IS HE WHO HEARS AND KNOWS ALL THINGS 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   RAISE NOT YOUR VOICES ABOVE THE VOICE OF THE PROPHET  NOR SPEAK ALOUD TO HIM IN TALK  AS YE MAY SPEAK ALOUD TO ONE ANOTHER  LEST YOUR DEEDS BECOME VAIN AND YE PERCEIVE NOT 
   THOSE THAT LOWER THEIR VOICE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD S APOSTLE  THEIR HEARTS HAS GOD TESTED FOR PIETY   FOR THEM IS FORGIVENESS AND A GREAT REWARD 
   THOSE WHO SHOUT OUT TO THEE FROM WITHOUT THE INNER APARTMENTS  MOST OF THEM LACK UNDERSTANDING 
   IF ONLY THEY HAD PATIENCE UNTIL THOU COULDST COME OUT TO THEM  IT WOULD BE BEST FOR THEM   BUT GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   IF A WICKED PERSON COMES TO YOU WITH ANY NEWS  ASCERTAIN THE TRUTH  LEST YE HARM PEOPLE UNWITTINGLY  AND AFTERWARDS BECOME FULL OF REPENTANCE FOR WHAT YE HAVE DONE 
   AND KNOW THAT AMONG YOU IS GOD S APOSTLE   WERE HE  IN MANY MATTERS  TO FOLLOW YOUR  WISHES   YE WOULD CERTAINLY FALL INTO MISFORTUNE   BUT GOD HAS ENDEARED THE FAITH TO YOU  AND HAS MADE IT BEAUTIFUL IN YOUR HEARTS  AND HE HAS MADE HATEFUL TO YOU UNBELIEF  WICKEDNESS  AND REBELLION   SUCH INDEED ARE THOSE WHO WALK IN RIGHTEOUSNESS   
   A GRACE AND FAVOUR FROM GOD   AND GOD IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM 
  IF TWO PARTIES AMONG THE BELIEVERS FALL INTO A QUARREL  MAKE YE PEACE BETWEEN THEM   BUT IF ONE OF THEM TRANSGRESSES BEYOND BOUNDS AGAINST THE OTHER  THEN FIGHT YE  ALL  AGAINST THE ONE THAT TRANSGRESSES UNTIL IT COMPLIES WITH THE COMMAND OF GOD   BUT IF IT COMPLIES  THEN MAKE PEACE BETWEEN THEM WITH JUSTICE  AND BE FAIR   FOR GOD LOVES THOSE WHO ARE FAIR  AND JUST  
   THE BELIEVERS ARE BUT A SINGLE BROTHERHOOD   SO MAKE PEACE AND RECONCILIATION BETWEEN YOUR TWO  CONTENDING  BROTHERS   AND FEAR GOD  THAT YE MAY RECEIVE MERCY SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   LET NOT SOME MEN AMONG YOU LAUGH AT OTHERS   IT MAY BE THAT THE  LATTER  ARE BETTER THAN THE  FORMER    NOR LET SOME WOMEN LAUGH AT OTHERS   IT MAY BE THAT THE  LATTER  ARE BETTER THAN THE  FORMER    NOR DEFAME NOR BE SARCASTIC TO EACH OTHER  NOR CALL EACH OTHER BY  OFFENSIVE  NICKNAMES   ILL SEEMING IS A NAME CONNOTING WICKEDNESS   TO BE USED OF ONE  AFTER HE HAS BELIEVED   AND THOSE WHO DO NOT DESIST ARE  INDEED  DOING WRONG 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   AVOID SUSPICION AS MUCH  AS POSSIBLE    FOR SUSPICION IN SOME CASES IS A SIN   AND SPY NOT ON EACH OTHER  NOR SPEAK ILL OF EACH OTHER BEHIND THEIR BACKS  WOULD ANY OF YOU LIKE TO EAT THE FLESH OF HIS DEAD BROTHER   NAY  YE WOULD ABHOR IT   BUT FEAR GOD   FOR GOD IS OFT RETURNING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   O MANKIND   WE CREATED YOU FROM A SINGLE  PAIR  OF A MALE AND A FEMALE  AND MADE YOU INTO NATIONS AND TRIBES  THAT YE MAY KNOW EACH OTHER  NOT THAT YE MAY DESPISE EACH OTHER   VERILY THE MOST HONOURED OF YOU IN THE SIGHT OF GOD IS  HE WHO IS  THE MOST RIGHTEOUS OF YOU  AND GOD HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE AND IS WELL ACQUAINTED  WITH ALL THINGS  
   THE DESERT ARABS SAY    WE BELIEVE    SAY    YE HAVE NO FAITH   BUT YE  ONLY  SAY    WE HAVE SUBMITTED OUR WILLS TO GOD    FOR NOT YET HAS FAITH ENTERED YOUR HEARTS  BUT IF YE OBEY GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  HE WILL NOT BELITTLE AUGHT OF YOUR DEEDS   FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL  
   ONLY THOSE ARE BELIEVERS WHO HAVE BELIEVED IN GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  AND HAVE NEVER SINCE DOUBTED  BUT HAVE STRIVEN WITH THEIR BELONGINGS AND THEIR PERSONS IN THE CAUSE OF GOD   SUCH ARE THE SINCERE ONES 
   SAY    WHAT   WILL YE INSTRUCT GOD ABOUT YOUR RELIGION   BUT GOD KNOWS ALL THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   HE HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THINGS 
   THEY IMPRESS ON THEE AS A FAVOUR THAT THEY HAVE EMBRACED ISLAM  SAY    COUNT NOT YOUR ISLAM AS A FAVOUR UPON ME   NAY  GOD HAS CONFERRED A FAVOUR UPON YOU THAT HE HAS GUIDED YOU TO THE FAITH  IF YE BE TRUE AND SINCERE 
     VERILY GOD KNOWS THE SECRETS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   AND GOD SEES WELL ALL THAT YE DO   
   QĀF  BY THE GLORIOUS QUR ĀN  THOU ART GOD S APOSTLE  
   BUT THEY WONDER THAT THERE HAS COME TO THEM A WARNER FROM AMONG THEMSELVES  SO THE UNBELIEVERS SAY     THIS IS A WONDERFUL THING  
     WHAT   WHEN WE DIE AND BECOME DUST   SHALL WE LIVE AGAIN    THAT IS A  SORT OF  RETURN FAR  FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING    
   WE ALREADY KNOW HOW MUCH OF THEM THE EARTH TAKES AWAY   WITH US IS A RECORD GUARDING  THE FULL ACCOUNT  
   BUT THEY DENY THE TRUTH WHEN IT COMES TO THEM   SO THEY ARE IN A CONFUSED STATE 
   DO THEY NOT LOOK AT THE SKY ABOVE THEM    HOW WE HAVE MADE IT AND ADORNED IT  AND THERE ARE NO FLAWS IN IT  
   AND THE EARTH WE HAVE SPREAD IT OUT  AND SET THEREON MOUNTAINS STANDING FIRM  AND PRODUCED THEREIN EVERY KIND OF BEAUTIFUL GROWTH  IN PAIRS  
   TO BE OBSERVED AND COMMEMORATED BY EVERY DEVOTEE TURNING  TO GOD  
   AND WE SEND DOWN FROM THE SKY RAIN CHARGED WITH BLESSING  AND WE PRODUCE THEREWITH GARDENS AND GRAIN FOR HARVESTS  
   AND TALL  AND STATELY  PALM TREES  WITH SHOOTS OF FRUIT STALKS  PILED ONE OVER ANOTHER   
   AS SUSTENANCE FOR  GOD S  SERVANTS    AND WE GIVE  NEW  LIFE THEREWITH TO LAND THAT IS DEAD   THUS WILL BE THE RESURRECTION 
   BEFORE THEM WAS DENIED  THE HEREAFTER  BY THE PEOPLE OF NOAH  THE COMPANIONS OF THE RASS  THE THAMŪD 
   THE  AD  PHARAOH  THE BRETHREN OF LŪT 
   THE COMPANIONS OF THE WOOD  AND THE PEOPLE OF TUBBA    EACH ONE  OF THEM  REJECTED THE APOSTLES  AND MY WARNING WAS DULY FULFILLED  IN THEM  
   WERE WE THEN WEARY WITH THE FIRST CREATION  THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN CONFUSED DOUBT ABOUT A NEW CREATION  SECTION  
    IT WAS WE WHO CREATED MAN  AND WE KNOW WHAT DARK SUGGESTIONS HIS SOUL MAKES TO HIM   FOR WE ARE NEARER TO HIM THAN  HIS  JUGULAR VEIN 
   BEHOLD  TWO  GUARDIAN ANGELS  APPOINTED TO LEARN  HIS DOINGS  LEARN  AND NOTE THEM   ONE SITTING ON THE RIGHT AND ONE ON THE LEFT 
   NOT A WORD DOES HE UTTER BUT THERE IS A SENTINEL BY HIM  READY  TO NOTE IT  
   AND THE STUPOR OF DEATH WILL BRING TRUTH  BEFORE HIS EYES      THIS WAS THE THING WHICH THOU WAST TRYING TO ESCAPE    
   AND THE TRUMPET SHALL BE BLOWN   THAT WILL BE THE DAY WHEREOF WARNING  HAD BEEN GIVEN  
   AND THERE WILL COME FORTH EVERY SOUL   WITH EACH WILL BE AN  ANGEL  TO DRIVE  AND AN  ANGEL  TO BEAR WITNESS 
    IT WILL BE SAID &COLON     THOU WAST HEEDLESS OF THIS   NOW HAVE WE REMOVED THY VEIL  AND SHARP IS THY SIGHT THIS DAY    
   AND HIS COMPANION WILL SAY     HERE IS  HIS RECORD  READY WITH ME    
    THE SENTENCE WILL BE &COLON     THROW  THROW INTO HELL EVERY CONTUMACIOUS REJECTOR  OF GOD    
     WHO FORBADE WHAT WAS GOOD  TRANSGRESSED ALL BOUNDS  CAST DOUBTS AND SUSPICIONS  
     WHO SET UP ANOTHER GOD BESIDES GOD   THROW HIM INTO A SEVERE PENALTY   
   HIS COMPANION WILL SAY     OUR LORD   I DID NOT MAKE HIM TRANSGRESS  BUT HE WAS  HIMSELF  FAR ASTRAY   
   HE WILL SAY     DISPUTE NOT WITH EACH OTHER IN MY PRESENCE   I HAD ALREADY IN ADVANCE SENT YOU WARNING 
     THE WORD CHANGES NOT BEFORE ME  AND I DO NOT THE LEAST INJUSTICE TO MY SERVANTS   SECTION  
   ONE DAY WE WILL ASK HELL    ART THOU FILLED TO THE FULL     IT WILL SAY    ARE THERE ANY MORE  TO COME     
   AND THE GARDEN WILL BE BROUGHT NIGH TO THE RIGHTEOUS  NO MORE A THING DISTANT 
    A VOICE WILL SAY &COLON     THIS IS WHAT WAS PROMISED FOR YOU   FOR EVERY ONE WHO TURNED  TO GOD  IN SINCERE REPENTANCE  WHO KEPT  HIS LAW  
    WHO FEARED  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS UNSEEN  AND BROUGHT A HEART TURNED IN DEVOTION  TO HIM   
     ENTER YE THEREIN IN PEACE AND SECURITY   THIS IS A DAY OF ETERNAL LIFE    
   THERE WILL BE FOR THEM THEREIN ALL THAT THEY WISH  AND MORE BESIDES IN OUR PRESENCE 
   BUT HOW MANY GENERATIONS BEFORE THEM DID WE DESTROY  FOR THEIR SINS   STRONGER IN POWER THAN THEY   THEN DID THEY WANDER THROUGH THE LAND   WAS THERE ANY PLACE OF ESCAPE  FOR THEM   
   VERILY IN THIS IS A MESSAGE FOR ANY THAT HAS A HEART AND UNDERSTANDING OR WHO GIVES EAR AND EARNESTLY WITNESSES  THE TRUTH  
   WE CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL BETWEEN THEM IN SIX DAYS  NOR DID ANY SENSE OF WEARINESS TOUCH US 
   BEAR  THEN  WITH PATIENCE  ALL THAT THEY SAY  AND CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF THY LORD  BEFORE THE RISING OF THE SUN AND BEFORE  ITS  SETTING 
   AND DURING PART OF THE NIGHT   ALSO   CELEBRATE HIS PRAISES  AND  SO LIKEWISE  AFTER THE POSTURES OF ADORATION 
   AND LISTEN FOR THE DAY WHEN THE CALLER WILL CALL OUT FROM A PLACE QUITE NEAR  
   THE DAY WHEN THEY WILL HEAR A  MIGHTY  BLAST IN  VERY  TRUTH    THAT WILL BE THE DAY OF RESURRECTION 
   VERILY IT IS WE WHO GIVE LIFE AND DEATH   AND TO US IS THE FINAL GOAL 
   THE DAY WHEN THE EARTH WILL BE RENT ASUNDER  FROM  MEN  HURRYING OUT   THAT WILL BE A GATHERING TOGETHER  QUITE EASY FOR US 
   WE KNOW BEST WHAT THEY SAY   AND THOU ART NOT ONE TO OVERAWE THEM BY FORCE  SO ADMONISH WITH THE QUR ĀN SUCH AS FEAR MY WARNING  
   BY THE  WINDS  THAT SCATTER BROADCAST  
   AND THOSE THAT LIFT AND BEAR AWAY HEAVY WEIGHTS  
   AND THOSE THAT FLOW WITH EASE AND GENTLENESS  
   AND THOSE THAT DISTRIBUTE AND APPORTION BY COMMAND   
   VERILY THAT WHICH YE ARE PROMISED IS TRUE  
   AND VERILY JUDGMENT AND JUSTICE MUST INDEED COME TO PASS 
   BY THE SKY WITH  ITS  NUMEROUS PATHS 
   TRULY YE ARE IN A DOCTRINE DISCORDANT 
   THROUGH WHICH ARE DELUDED  AWAY FROM THE TRUTH  SUCH AS WOULD BE DELUDED 
   WOE TO THE FALSEHOOD MONGERS  
   THOSE WHO  FLOUNDER  HEEDLESS IN A FLOOD OF CONFUSION  
   THEY ASK    WHEN WILL BE THE DAY OF JUDGMENT AND JUSTICE    
    IT WILL BE  A DAY WHEN THEY WILL BE TRIED  AND TESTED  OVER THE FIRE  
     TASTE YE YOUR TRIAL   THIS IS WHAT YE USED TO ASK TO BE HASTENED    
   AS TO THE RIGHTEOUS  THEY WILL BE IN THE MIDST OF GARDENS AND SPRINGS 
   TAKING JOY IN THE THINGS WHICH THEIR LORD GIVES THEM  BECAUSE  BEFORE THEN  THEY LIVED A GOOD LIFE 
   THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF SLEEPING BUT LITTLE BY NIGHT 
   AND IN THE HOURS OF EARLY DAWN  THEY  WERE FOUND  PRAYING FOR FORGIVENESS  
   AND IN THEIR WEALTH AND POSSESSIONS  WAS REMEMBERED  THE RIGHT OF THE  NEEDY   HIM WHO ASKED  AND HIM WHO  FOR SOME REASON  WAS PREVENTED  FROM ASKING  
   ON THE EARTH ARE SIGNS FOR THOSE OF ASSURED FAITH 
   AS ALSO IN YOUR OWN SELVES   WILL YE NOT THEN SEE  
   AND IN HEAVEN IS YOUR SUSTENANCE  AS  ALSO  THAT WHICH YE ARE PROMISED 
   THEN  BY THE LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH  THIS IS THE VERY TRUTH  AS MUCH AS THE FACT THAT YE CAN SPEAK INTELLIGENTLY TO EACH OTHER SECTION  
   HAS THE STORY REACHED THEE  OF THE HONOURED GUESTS OF ABRAHAM  
   BEHOLD  THEY ENTERED HIS PRESENCE  AND SAID     PEACE     HE SAID    PEACE      AND THOUGHT    THESE SEEM  UNUSUAL PEOPLE   
   THEN HE TURNED QUICKLY TO HIS HOUSEHOLD  BROUGHT OUT A FATTED CALF 
   AND PLACED IT BEFORE THEM   HE SAID    WILL YE NOT EAT    
    WHEN THEY DID NOT EAT   HE CONCEIVED A FEAR OF THEM  THEY SAID    FEAR NOT    AND THEY GAVE HIM GLAD TIDINGS OF A SON ENDOWED WITH KNOWLEDGE 
   BUT HIS WIFE CAME FORWARD  LAUGHING  ALOUD   SHE SMOTE HER FOREHEAD AND SAID     A BARREN OLD WOMAN    
   THEY SAID    EVEN SO HAS THY LORD SPOKEN   AND HE IS FULL OF WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE   
    ABRAHAM  SAID     AND WHAT  O YE MESSENGERS  IS YOUR ERRAND  NOW     
   THEY SAID    WE HAVE BEEN SENT TO A PEOPLE  DEEP  IN SIN   
     TO BRING ON  ON THEM   A SHOWER OF  STONES OF CLAY  BRIMSTONE  
     MARKED AS FROM THY LORD FOR THOSE WHO TRESPASS BEYOND BOUNDS   
   THEN WE EVACUATED THOSE OF THE BELIEVERS WHO WERE THERE 
   BUT WE FOUND NOT THERE ANY JUST  MUSLIM  PERSONS EXCEPT IN ONE HOUSE  
   AND WE LEFT THERE A SIGN FOR SUCH AS FEAR THE GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   AND IN MOSES  WAS ANOTHER SIGN    BEHOLD  WE SENT HIM TO PHARAOH  WITH AUTHORITY MANIFEST 
   BUT  PHARAOH  TURNED BACK WITH HIS CHIEFS  AND SAID    A SORCERER  OR ONE POSSESSED    
   SO WE TOOK HIM AND HIS FORCES  AND THREW THEM INTO THE SEA   AND HIS WAS THE BLAME 
   AND IN THE  AD  PEOPLE   WAS ANOTHER SIGN    BEHOLD  WE SENT AGAINST THEM THE DEVASTATING WIND  
   IT LEFT NOTHING WHATEVER THAT IT CAME UP AGAINST  BUT REDUCED IT TO RUIN AND ROTTENNESS 
   AND IN THE THAMŪD  WAS ANOTHER SIGN    BEHOLD  THEY WERE TOLD    ENJOY  YOUR BRIEF DAY  FOR A LITTLE WHILE    
   BUT THEY INSOLENTLY DEFIED THE COMMAND OF THEIR LORD   SO THE STUNNING NOISE  OF AN EARTHQUAKE  SEIZED THEM  EVEN WHILE THEY WERE LOOKING ON 
   THEN THEY COULD NOT EVEN STAND  ON THEIR FEET   NOR COULD THEY HELP THEMSELVES 
   SO WERE THE PEOPLE OF NOAH BEFORE THEM   FOR THEY WICKEDLY TRANSGRESSED SECTION  
   WITH POWER AND SKILL DID WE CONSTRUCT THE FIRMAMENT   FOR IT IS WE WHO CREATE THE VASTNESS OF SPACE 
   AND WE HAVE SPREAD OUT THE  SPACIOUS  EARTH   HOW EXCELLENTLY WE DO SPREAD OUT  
   AND OF EVERY THING WE HAVE CREATED PAIRS   THAT YE MAY RECEIVE INSTRUCTION 
   HASTEN YE THEN  AT ONCE  TO GOD   I AM FROM HIM A WARNER TO YOU  CLEAR AND OPEN  
   AND MAKE NOT ANOTHER AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP WITH GOD   I AM FROM HIM A WARNER TO YOU  CLEAR AND OPEN  
   SIMILARLY  NO APOSTLE CAME TO THE PEOPLES BEFORE THEM  BUT THEY SAID  OF HIM  IN LIKE MANNER    A SORCERER  OR ONE POSSESSED    
   IS THIS THE LEGACY THEY HAVE TRANSMITTED  ONE TO ANOTHER   NAY  THEY ARE THEMSELVES A PEOPLE TRANSGRESSING BEYOND BOUNDS  
   SO TURN AWAY FROM THEM   NOT THINE IS THE BLAME 
   BUT TEACH  THY MESSAGE    FOR TEACHING BENEFITS THE BELIEVERS 
   I HAVE ONLY CREATED JINNS AND MEN  THAT THEY MAY SERVE ME 
   NO SUSTENANCE DO I REQUIRE OF THEM  NOR DO I REQUIRE THAT THEY SHOULD FEED ME 
   FOR GOD IS HE WHO GIVES  ALL  SUSTENANCE  LORD OF POWER  STEADFAST  FOR EVER  
   FOR THE WRONG DOERS  THEIR PORTION IS LIKE UNTO THE PORTION OF THEIR FELLOWS  OF EARLIER GENERATIONS    THEN LET THEM NOT ASK ME TO HASTEN  THAT PORTION   
   WOE  THEN  TO THE UNBELIEVERS  ON ACCOUNT OF THAT DAY OF THEIRS WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN PROMISED  
   BY THE MOUNT  OF REVELATION   
   BY A DECREE INSCRIBED
   IN A SCROLL UNFOLDED  
   BY THE MUCH FREQUENTED FANE  
   BY THE CANOPY RAISED HIGH  
   AND BY THE OCEAN FILLED WITH SWELL   
   VERILY  THE DOOM OF THY LORD WILL INDEED COME TO PASS   
   THERE IS NONE CAN AVERT IT   
   ON THE DAY WHEN THE FIRMAMENT WILL BE IN DREADFUL COMMOTION 
   AND THE MOUNTAINS WILL FLY HITHER AND THITHER 
   THEN WOE THAT DAY TO THOSE THAT TREAT  TRUTH  AS FALSEHOOD   
   THAT PLAY  AND PADDLE  IN SHALLOW TRIFLES 
   THAT DAY SHALL THEY BE THRUST DOWN TO THE FIRE OF HELL  IRRESISTIBLY 
     THIS    IT WILL BE SAID    IS THE FIRE  WHICH YE WERE WONT TO DENY  
     IS THIS THEN A FAKE  OR IS IT YE THAT DO NOT SEE  
     BURN YE THEREIN   THE SAME IS IT TO YOU WHETHER YE BEAR IT WITH PATIENCE  OR NOT   YE BUT RECEIVE THE RECOMPENSE OF YOUR  OWN  DEEDS   
   AS TO THE RIGHTEOUS  THEY WILL BE IN GARDENS  AND IN HAPPINESS  
   ENJOYING THE  BLISS  WHICH THEIR LORD HATH BESTOWED ON THEM  AND THEIR LORD SHALL DELIVER THEM FROM THE PENALTY OF THE FIRE 
    TO THEM WILL BE SAID      EAT AND DRINK YE  WITH PROFIT AND HEALTH  BECAUSE OF YOUR  GOOD  DEEDS   
   THEY WILL RECLINE  WITH EASE  ON THRONES  OF DIGNITY  ARRANGED IN RANKS   AND WE SHALL JOIN THEM TO COMPANIONS  WITH BEAUTIFUL BIG AND LUSTROUS EYES 
   AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WHOSE FAMILIES FOLLOW THEM IN FAITH  TO THEM SHALL WE JOIN THEIR FAMILIES   NOR SHALL WE DEPRIVE THEM  OF THE FRUIT  OF AUGHT OF THEIR WORKS    YET  IS EACH INDIVIDUAL IN PLEDGE FOR HIS DEEDS 
   AND WE SHALL BESTOW ON THEM  OF FRUIT AND MEAT  ANYTHING THEY SHALL DESIRE 
   THEY SHALL THERE EXCHANGE  ONE WITH ANOTHER  A  LOVING  CUP FREE OF FRIVOLITY  FREE OF ALL TAINT OF ILL 
   ROUND ABOUT THEM WILL SERVE   DEVOTED  TO THEM  YOUTHS  HANDSOME  AS PEARLS WELL GUARDED 
   THEY WILL ADVANCE TO EACH OTHER  ENGAGING IN MUTUAL ENQUIRY 
   THEY WILL SAY     AFORETIME  WE WERE NOT WITHOUT FEAR FOR THE SAKE OF OUR PEOPLE 
     BUT GOD HAS BEEN GOOD TO US  AND HAS DELIVERED US FROM THE PENALTY OF THE SCORCHING WIND 
     TRULY  WE DID CALL UNTO HIM FROM OF OLD   TRULY IT IS HE  THE BENEFICENT  THE MERCIFUL    SECTION  
   THEREFORE PROCLAIM THOU THE PRAISES  OF THY LORD    FOR BY THE GRACE OF THY LORD  THOU ART NO  VULGAR  SOOTHSAYER  NOR ART THOU ONE POSSESSED 
   OR DO THEY SAY      A POET  WE AWAIT FOR HIM SOME CALAMITY  HATCHED  BY TIME    
   SAY THOU     AWAIT YE    I TOO WILL WAIT ALONG WITH YOU    
   IS IT THAT THEIR FACULTIES OF UNDERSTANDING URGE THEM TO THIS  OR ARE THEY BUT A PEOPLE TRANSGRESSING BEYOND BOUNDS  
   OR DO THEY SAY    HE FABRICATED THE  MESSAGE      NAY  THEY HAVE NO FAITH  
   LET THEM THEN PRODUCE A RECITAL LIKE UNTO IT   IF  IT BE  THEY SPEAK THE TRUTH  
   WERE THEY CREATED OF NOTHING  OR WERE THEY THEMSELVES THE CREATORS  
   OR DID THEY CREATE THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   NAY  THEY HAVE NO FIRM BELIEF 
   OR ARE THE TREASURES OF THY LORD WITH THEM  OR ARE THEY THE MANAGERS  OF AFFAIRS   
   OR HAVE THEY A LADDER  BY WHICH THEY CAN  CLIMB UP TO HEAVEN AND  LISTEN  TO ITS SECRETS    THEN LET  SUCH A  LISTENER OF THEIRS PRODUCE A MANIFEST PROOF 
   OR HAS HE ONLY DAUGHTERS AND YE HAVE SONS  
   OR IS IT THAT THOU DOST ASK FOR A REWARD SO THAT THEY ARE BURDENED WITH A LOAD OF DEBT   
   OR THAT THE UNSEEN IS IN THEIR HANDS  AND THEY WRITE IT DOWN  
   OR DO THEY INTEND A PLOT  AGAINST THEE    BUT THOSE WHO DEFY GOD ARE THEMSELVES INVOLVED IN A PLOT  
   OR HAVE THEY A GOD OTHER THAN GOD   EXALTED IS GOD FAR ABOVE THE THINGS THEY ASSOCIATE WITH HIM  
   WERE THEY TO SEE A PIECE OF THE SKY FALLING  ON THEM   THEY WOULD  ONLY  SAY     CLOUDS GATHERED IN HEAPS    
   SO LEAVE THEM ALONE UNTIL THEY ENCOUNTER THAT DAY OF THEIRS  WHEREIN THEY SHALL  PERFORCE  SWOON  WITH TERROR   
   THE DAY WHEN THEIR PLOTTING WILL AVAIL THEM NOTHING AND NO HELP SHALL BE GIVEN THEM 
   AND VERILY  FOR THOSE WHO DO WRONG  THERE IS ANOTHER PUNISHMENT BESIDES THIS   BUT MOST OF THEM UNDERSTAND NOT 
   NOW AWAIT IN PATIENCE THE COMMAND OF THY LORD   FOR VERILY THOU ART IN OUR EYES   AND CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF THY LORD THE WHILE THOU STANDEST FORTH 
   AND FOR PART OF THE NIGHT ALSO PRAISE THOU HIM   AND AT THE RETREAT OF THE STARS  
   BY THE STAR WHEN IT GOES DOWN  
   YOUR COMPANION IS NEITHER ASTRAY NOR BEING MISLED 
   NOR DOES HE SAY  AUGHT  OF  HIS OWN  DESIRE 
   IT IS NO LESS THAN INSPIRATION SENT DOWN TO HIM  
   HE WAS TAUGHT BY ONE MIGHTY IN POWER 
   ENDUED WITH WISDOM   FOR HE APPEARED  IN STATELY FORM 
   WHILE HE WAS IN THE HIGHEST PART OF THE HORIZON  
   THEN HE APPROACHED AND CAME CLOSER 
   AND WAS AT A DISTANCE OF BUT TWO BOW LENGTHS OR  EVEN  NEARER  
   SO DID  GOD  CONVEY THE INSPIRATION TO HIS SERVANT   CONVEYED  WHAT HE  MEANT  TO CONVEY 
   THE  PROPHET S   MIND AND  HEART IN NO WAY FALSIFIED THAT WHICH HE SAW 
   WILL YE THEN DISPUTE WITH HIM CONCERNING WHAT HE SAW  
   FOR INDEED HE SAW HIM AT A SECOND DESCENT 
   NEAR THE LOTE TREE BEYOND WHICH NONE MAY PASS  
   NEAR IT IS THE GARDEN OF ABODE 
   BEHOLD  THE LOTE TREE WAS SHROUDED  IN MYSTERY UNSPEAKABLE   
    HIS  SIGHT NEVER SWERVED  NOR DID IT GO WRONG  
   FOR TRULY DID HE SEE  OF THE SIGNS OF HIS LORD  THE GREATEST  
   HAVE YE SEEN LĀT  AND  UZZĀ 
   AND ANOTHER  THE THIRD  GODDESS   MANĀT 
   WHAT   FOR YOU THE MALE SEX  AND FOR HIM  THE FEMALE  
   BEHOLD  SUCH WOULD BE INDEED A DIVISION MOST UNFAIR  
   THESE ARE NOTHING BUT NAMES WHICH YE HAVE DEVISED    YE AND YOUR FATHERS   FOR WHICH GOD HAS SENT DOWN NO AUTHORITY  WHATEVER   THEY FOLLOW NOTHING BUT CONJECTURE AND WHAT THEIR OWN SOULS DESIRE    EVEN THOUGH THERE HAS ALREADY COME TO THEM GUIDANCE FROM THEIR LORD  
   NAY  SHALL MAN HAVE  JUST  ANYTHING HE HANKERS AFTER  
   BUT IT IS TO GOD THAT THE END AND THE BEGINNING  OF ALL THINGS  BELONG SECTION  
   HOW MANY SO EVER BE THE ANGELS IN THE HEAVENS  THEIR INTERCESSION WILL AVAIL NOTHING EXCEPT AFTER GOD HAS GIVEN LEAVE FOR WHOM HE PLEASES AND THAT HE IS ACCEPTABLE TO HIM 
   THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT IN THE HEREAFTER  NAME THE ANGELS WITH FEMALE NAMES 
   BUT THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE THEREIN  THEY FOLLOW NOTHING BUT CONJECTURE   AND CONJECTURE AVAILS NOTHING AGAINST TRUTH 
   THEREFORE SHUN THOSE WHO TURN AWAY FROM OUR MESSAGE AND DESIRE NOTHING BUT THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD 
   THAT IS AS FAR AS KNOWLEDGE WILL REACH THEM  VERILY THY LORD KNOWETH BEST THOSE WHO STRAY FROM HIS PATH  AND HE KNOWETH BEST THOSE WHO RECEIVE GUIDANCE 
   YEA  TO GOD BELONGS ALL THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   SO THAT HE REWARDS THOSE WHO DO EVIL  ACCORDING TO THEIR DEEDS  AND HE REWARDS THOSE WHO DO GOOD  WITH WHAT IS BEST 
   THOSE WHO AVOID GREAT SINS AND SHAMEFUL DEEDS  ONLY  FALLING INTO  SMALL FAULTS   VERILY THY LORD IS AMPLE IN FORGIVENESS  HE KNOWS YOU WELL WHEN HE BRINGS YOU OUT OF THE EARTH  AND WHEN YE ARE HIDDEN IN YOUR MOTHERS  WOMBS  THEREFORE JUSTIFY NOT YOURSELVES   HE KNOWS BEST WHO IT IS THAT GUARDS AGAINST EVIL SECTION  
   SEEST THOU ONE WHO TURNS BACK 
   GIVES A LITTLE  THEN HARDENS  HIS HEART   
   WHAT   HAS HE KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNSEEN SO THAT HE CAN SEE  
   NAY  IS HE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH WHAT IS IN THE BOOKS OF MOSES 
   AND OF ABRAHAM WHO FULFILLED HIS ENGAGEMENTS   
   NAMELY  THAT NO BEARER OF BURDENS CAN BEAR THE BURDEN OF ANOTHER  
   THAT MAN CAN HAVE NOTHING BUT WHAT HE STRIVES FOR  
   THAT  THE FRUIT OF  HIS STRIVING WILL SOON COME IN SIGHT  
   THEN WILL HE BE REWARDED WITH A REWARD COMPLETE  
   THAT TO THY LORD IS THE FINAL GOAL  
   THAT IT IS HE WHO GRANTETH LAUGHTER AND TEARS  
   THAT IT IS HE WHO GRANTETH DEATH AND LIFE  
   THAT HE DID CREATE IN PAIRS   MALE AND FEMALE 
   FROM A SEED WHEN LODGED  IN ITS PLACE   
   THAT HE HATH PROMISED A SECOND CREATION  RAISING OF THE DEAD   
   THAT IT IS HE WHO GIVETH WEALTH AND SATISFACTION  
   THAT HE IS THE LORD OF SIRIUS  THE MIGHTY STAR   
   AND THAT IT IS HE WHO DESTROYED THE  POWERFUL  ANCIENT  ĀD  PEOPLE  
   AND THE THAMŪD  NOR GAVE THEM A LEASE OF PERPETUAL LIFE 
   AND BEFORE THEM  THE PEOPLE OF NOAH  FOR THAT THEY WERE  ALL  MOST UNJUST AND MOST INSOLENT TRANSGRESSORS 
   AND HE DESTROYED THE OVERTHROWN CITIES  OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH  
   SO THAT  RUINS UNKNOWN  HAVE COVERED THEM UP 
   THEN WHICH OF THE GIFTS OF THY LORD   O MAN   WILT THOU DISPUTE ABOUT  
   THIS IS A WARNER  OF THE  SERIES OF  WARNERS OF OLD  
   THE  JUDGMENT  EVER APPROACHING DRAWS NIGH  
   NO  SOUL  BUT GOD CAN LAY IT BARE 
   DO YE THEN WONDER AT THIS RECITAL  
   AND WILL YE LAUGH AND NOT WEEP  
   WASTING YOUR TIME IN VANITIES  
   BUT FALL YE DOWN IN PROSTRATION TO GOD  AND ADORE  HIM  
   THE HOUR  OF JUDGMENT  IS NIGH  AND THE MOON IS CLEFT ASUNDER 
   BUT IF THEY SEE A SIGN  THEY TURN AWAY  AND SAY    THIS IS  BUT  TRANSIENT MAGIC   
   THEY REJECT  THE WARNING  AND FOLLOW THEIR  OWN  LUSTS BUT EVERY MATTER HAS ITS APPOINTED TIME 
   THERE HAVE ALREADY COME TO THEM RECITALS WHEREIN THERE IS  ENOUGH  TO CHECK  THEM  
   MATURE WISDOM   BUT  THE PREACHING OF  WARNERS PROFITS THEM NOT 
   THEREFORE   O PROPHET   TURN AWAY FROM THEM  THE DAY THAT THE CALLER WILL CALL  THEM  TO A TERRIBLE AFFAIR 
   THEY WILL COME FORTH  THEIR EYES HUMBLED FROM  THEIR  GRAVES   TORPID  LIKE LOCUSTS SCATTERED ABROAD 
   HASTENING WITH EYES TRANSFIXED  TOWARDS THE CALLER      HARD IS THIS DAY     THE UNBELIEVERS WILL SAY 
   BEFORE THEM THE PEOPLE OF NOAH REJECTED  THEIR APOSTLE    THEY REJECTED OUR SERVANT  AND SAID    HERE IS ONE POSSESSED      AND HE WAS DRIVEN OUT 
   THEN HE CALLED ON HIS LORD     I AM ONE OVERCOME   DO THOU THEN HELP  ME     
   SO WE OPENED THE GATES OF HEAVEN  WITH WATER POURING FORTH 
   AND WE CAUSED THE EARTH TO GUSH FORTH WITH SPRINGS  SO THE WATERS MET  AND ROSE  TO THE EXTENT DECREED 
   BUT WE BORE HIM ON AN  ARK  MADE OF BROAD PLANKS AND CAULKED WITH PALM FIBRE  
   SHE FLOATS UNDER OUR EYES  AND CARE    A RECOMPENSE TO ONE WHO HAD BEEN REJECTED  WITH SCORN   
   AND WE HAVE LEFT THIS AS A SIGN  FOR ALL TIME    THEN IS THERE ANY THAT WILL RECEIVE ADMONITION  
   BUT HOW  TERRIBLE  WAS MY PENALTY AND MY WARNING  
   AND WE HAVE INDEED MADE THE QUR ĀN EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND REMEMBER   THEN IS THERE ANY THAT WILL RECEIVE ADMONITION  
   THE  AD  PEOPLE   TOO  REJECTED  TRUTH    THEN HOW TERRIBLE WAS MY PENALTY AND MY WARNING  
   FOR WE SENT AGAINST THEM A FURIOUS WIND  ON A DAY OF VIOLENT DISASTER 
   PLUCKING OUT MEN AS IF THEY WERE ROOTS OF PALM TREES TORN UP  FROM THE GROUND  
   YEA  HOW  TERRIBLE  WAS MY PENALTY AND MY WARNING  
   BUT WE HAVE INDEED MADE THE QUR ĀN EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND REMEMBER   THEN IS THERE ANY THAT WILL RECEIVE ADMONITION  SECTION  
   THE THAMŪD  ALSO  REJECTED  THEIR  WARNERS 
   FOR THEY SAID     WHAT   A MAN   A SOLITARY ONE FROM AMONG OURSELVES   SHALL WE FOLLOW SUCH A ONE   TRULY SHOULD WE THEN BE STRAYING IN MIND  AND MAD  
     IS IT THAT THE MESSAGE IS SENT TO HIM  OF ALL PEOPLE AMONGST US   NAY  HE IS A LIAR  AN INSOLENT ONE    
   AH   THEY WILL KNOW ON THE MORROW  WHICH IS THE LIAR  THE INSOLENT ONE  
   FOR WE WILL SEND THE SHE CAMEL BY WAY OF TRIAL FOR THEM  SO WATCH THEM   O SĀLIH   AND POSSESS THYSELF IN PATIENCE  
   AND TELL THEM THAT THE WATER IS TO BE DIVIDED BETWEEN THEM   EACH ONE S RIGHT TO DRINK BEING BROUGHT FORWARD  BY SUITABLE TURNS  
   BUT THEY CALLED TO THEIR COMPANION  AND HE TOOK A SWORD IN HAND  AND HAMSTRUNG  HER  
   AH   HOW  TERRIBLE  WAS MY PENALTY AND MY WARNING  
   FOR WE SENT AGAINST THEM A SINGLE MIGHTY BLAST  AND THEY BECAME LIKE THE DRY STUBBLE USED BY ONE WHO PENS CATTLE 
   AND WE HAVE INDEED MADE THE QUR ĀN EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND REMEMBER   THEN IS THERE ANY THAT WILL RECEIVE ADMONITION  
   THE PEOPLE OF LŪT REJECTED  HIS  WARNING 
   WE SENT AGAINST THEM A VIOLENT TORNADO WITH SHOWERS OF STONES   WHICH DESTROYED THEM   EXCEPT LŪT S HOUSEHOLD   THEM WE DELIVERED BY EARLY DAWN  
   AS A GRACE FROM US   THUS DO WE REWARD THOSE WHO GIVE THANKS 
   AND  LŪT  DID WARN THEM OF OUR PUNISHMENT  BUT THEY DISPUTED ABOUT THE WARNING 
   AND THEY EVEN SOUGHT TO SNATCH AWAY HIS GUESTS FROM HIM  BUT WE BLINDED THEIR EYES   THEY HEARD &COLON     NOW TASTE YE MY WRATH AND MY WARNING   
   EARLY ON THE MORROW AN ABIDING PUNISHMENT SEIZED THEM  
     SO TASTE YE MY WRATH AND MY WARNING   
   AND WE HAVE INDEED MADE THE QUR ĀN EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND REMEMBER   THEN IS THERE ANY THAT WILL RECEIVE ADMONITION  SECTION  
   TO THE PEOPLE OF PHARAOH  TOO  AFORETIME  CAME WARNERS  FROM GOD  
   THE  PEOPLE  REJECTED ALL OUR SIGNS   BUT WE SEIZED THEM WITH SUCH PENALTY  AS COMES  FROM ONE EXALTED IN POWER  ABLE TO CARRY OUT HIS WILL 
   ARE YOUR UNBELIEVERS   O QURAISH   BETTER THAN THEY   OR HAVE YE AN IMMUNITY IN THE SACRED BOOKS  
   OR DO THEY SAY     WE ACTING TOGETHER CAN DEFEND OURSELVES    
   SOON WILL THEIR MULTITUDE BE PUT TO FLIGHT  AND THEY WILL SHOW THEIR BACKS 
   NAY  THE HOUR  OF JUDGMENT  IS THE TIME PROMISED THEM  FOR THEIR FULL RECOMPENSE    AND THAT HOUR WILL BE MOST GRIEVOUS AND MOST BITTER 
   TRULY THOSE IN SIN ARE THE ONES STRAYING IN MIND  AND MAD 
   THE DAY THEY WILL BE DRAGGED THROUGH THE FIRE ON THEIR FACES   THEY WILL HEAR &COLON     TASTE YE THE TOUCH OF HELL    
   VERILY  ALL THINGS HAVE WE CREATED IN PROPORTION AND MEASURE 
   AND OUR COMMAND IS BUT A SINGLE  ACT    LIKE THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE 
   AND  OFT  IN THE PAST  HAVE WE DESTROYED GANGS LIKE UNTO YOU   THEN IS THERE ANY THAT WILL RECEIVE ADMONITION

   AND THOSE FOREMOST  IN FAITH  WILL BE FOREMOST  IN THE HEREAFTER  
   THESE WILL BE THOSE NEAREST TO GOD  
   IN GARDENS OF BLISS

   BY WATER FLOWING CONSTANTLY 
   AND FRUIT IN ABUNDANCE 
   WHOSE SEASON IS NOT LIMITED  NOR  SUPPLY  FORBIDDEN 
   AND ON THRONES  OF DIGNITY   RAISED HIGH

   BELOVED  BY NATURE   EQUAL IN AGE  
   FOR THE COMPANIONS OF THE RIGHT HAND SECTION  
   A  GOODLY  NUMBER FROM THOSE OF OLD 
   AND A  GOODLY  NUMBER FROM THOSE OF LATER TIMES 
   THE COMPANIONS OF THE LEFT HAND  WHAT WILL BE THE COMPANIONS OF THE LEFT HAND  
    THEY WILL BE  IN THE MIDST OF A FIERCE BLAST OF FIRE AND IN BOILING WATER 
   AND IN THE SHADES OF BLACK SMOKE  
   NOTHING  WILL THERE BE  TO REFRESH  NOR TO PLEASE  
   FOR THAT THEY WERE WONT TO BE INDULGED  BEFORE THAT  IN WEALTH  AND LUXURY  
   AND PERSISTED OBSTINATELY IN WICKEDNESS SUPREME  
   AND THEY USED TO SAY    WHAT   WHEN WE DIE AND BECOME DUST AND BONES  SHALL WE THEN INDEED BE RAISED UP AGAIN   
      WE  AND OUR FATHERS OF OLD    
   SAY     YEA  THOSE OF OLD AND THOSE OF LATER TIMES 
     ALL WILL CERTAINLY BE GATHERED TOGETHER FOR THE MEETING APPOINTED FOR A DAY WELL KNOWN 
     THEN WILL YE TRULY   O YE THAT GO WRONG  AND TREAT  TRUTH  AS FALSEHOOD

     THEN WILL YE FILL YOUR INSIDES THEREWITH 
     AND DRINK BOILING WATER ON TOP OF IT

   WE HAVE DECREED DEATH TO BE YOUR COMMON LOT  AND WE ARE NOT TO BE FRUSTRATED
   FROM CHANGING YOUR FORMS AND CREATING YOU  AGAIN  IN  FORMS  THAT YE KNOW NOT 
   AND YE CERTAINLY KNOW ALREADY THE FIRST FORM OF CREATION   WHY THEN DO YE NOT CELEBRATE HIS PRAISES  
   SEE YE THE SEED THAT YE SOW IN THE GROUND  
   IS IT YE THAT CAUSE IT TO GROW  OR ARE WE THE CAUSE

    SAYING     WE ARE INDEED LEFT WITH DEBTS  FOR NOTHING   
     INDEED ARE WE SHUT OUT  OF THE FRUITS OF OUR LABOUR    
   SEE YE THE WATER WHICH YE DRINK

   WERE IT OUR WILL  WE COULD MAKE IT SALT  AND UNPALATABLE    THEN WHY DO YE NOT GIVE THANKS  
   SEE YE THE FIRE WHICH YE KINDLE  
   IS IT YE WHO GROW THE TREE WHICH FEEDS THE FIRE  OR DO WE GROW IT  
   WE HAVE MADE IT A MEMORIAL  OF OUR HANDIWORK   AND AN ARTICLE OF COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE FOR THE DENIZENS OF DESERTS 
   THEN CELEBRATE WITH PRAISES THE NAME OF THY LORD  THE SUPREME  SECTION  
   FURTHERMORE I CALL TO WITNESS THE SETTING OF THE STARS  
   AND THAT IS INDEED A MIGHTY ADJURATION IF YE BUT KNEW  
   THAT THIS IS INDEED A QUR ĀN MOST HONOURABLE 
   IN A BOOK WELL GUARDED 
   WHICH NONE SHALL TOUCH BUT THOSE WHO ARE CLEAN  
   A REVELATION FROM THE LORD OF THE WORLDS 
   IS IT SUCH A MESSAGE THAT YE WOULD HOLD IN LIGHT ESTEEM  
   AND HAVE YE MADE IT YOUR LIVELIHOOD THAT YE SHOULD DECLARE IT FALSE  
   THEN WHY DO YE NOT  INTERVENE  WHEN  THE SOUL OF THE DYING MAN  REACHES THE THROAT  
   AND YE THE WHILE  SIT  LOOKING ON  
   BUT WE ARE NEARER TO HIM THAN YE  AND YET SEE NOT  
   THEN WHY DO YOU NOT   IF YOU ARE EXEMPT FROM  FUTURE  ACCOUNT  
   CALL BACK THE SOUL  IF YE ARE TRUE  IN YOUR CLAIM OF INDEPENDENCE   
   THUS  THEN  IF HE BE OF THOSE NEAREST TO GOD 
    THERE IS FOR HIM  REST AND SATISFACTION  AND A GARDEN OF DELIGHTS 
   AND IF HE BE OF THE COMPANIONS OF THE RIGHT HAND 
    FOR HIM IS THE SALUTATION     PEACE BE UNTO THEE    FROM THE COMPANIONS OF THE RIGHT HAND 
   AND IF HE BE OF THOSE WHO TREAT  TRUTH  AS FALSEHOOD  WHO GO WRONG 
   FOR HIM IS ENTERTAINMENT WITH BOILING WATER 
   AND BURNING IN HELL FIRE 
   VERILY  THIS IS THE VERY TRUTH AND CERTAINTY

   HAS NOT THE TIME ARRIVED FOR THE BELIEVERS THAT THEIR HEARTS IN ALL HUMILITY SHOULD ENGAGE IN THE REMEMBRANCE OF GOD AND OF THE TRUTH WHICH HAS BEEN REVEALED  TO THEM   AND THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BECOME LIKE THOSE TO WHOM WAS GIVEN REVELATION AFORETIME  BUT LONG AGES PASSED OVER THEM AND THEIR HEARTS GREW HARD   FOR MANY AMONG THEM ARE REBELLIOUS TRANSGRESSORS 
   KNOW YE  ALL  THAT GOD GIVETH LIFE TO THE EARTH AFTER ITS DEATH   ALREADY HAVE WE SHOWN THE SIGNS PLAINLY TO YOU  THAT YE MAY LEARN WISDOM 
   FOR THOSE WHO GIVE IN CHARITY  MEN AND WOMEN  AND LOAN TO GOD A BEAUTIFUL LOAN  IT SHALL BE INCREASED MANIFOLD  TO THEIR CREDIT   AND THEY SHALL HAVE  BESIDES  A LIBERAL REWARD 
   AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND HIS APOSTLES THEY ARE THE SINCERE  LOVERS OF TRUTH   AND THE WITNESSES  WHO TESTIFY   IN THE EYES OF THEIR LORD   THEY SHALL HAVE THEIR REWARD AND THEIR LIGHT  BUT THOSE WHO REJECT GOD AND DENY OUR SIGNS  THEY ARE THE COMPANIONS OF HELL FIRE SECTION  
   KNOW YE  ALL   THAT THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD IS BUT PLAY AND AMUSEMENT  POMP AND MUTUAL BOASTING AND MULTIPLYING   IN RIVALRY  AMONG YOURSELVES  RICHES AND CHILDREN  HERE IS A SIMILITUDE   HOW RAIN AND THE GROWTH WHICH IT BRINGS FORTH  DELIGHT  THE HEARTS OF  THE TILLERS   SOON IT WITHERS   THOU WILT SEE IT GROW YELLOW   THEN IT BECOMES DRY AND CRUMBLES AWAY  BUT IN THE HEREAFTER IS A PENALTY SEVERE  FOR THE DEVOTEES OF WRONG   AND FORGIVENESS FROM GOD AND  HIS  GOOD PLEASURE  FOR THE DEVOTEES OF GOD   AND WHAT IS THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD  BUT GOODS AND CHATTELS OF DECEPTION  
   BE YE FOREMOST  IN SEEKING  FORGIVENESS FROM YOUR LORD  AND A GARDEN  OF BLISS   THE WIDTH WHEREOF IS AS THE WIDTH OF HEAVEN AND EARTH  PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND HIS APOSTLES   THAT IS THE GRACE OF GOD  WHICH HE BESTOWS ON WHOM HE PLEASES   AND GOD IS THE LORD OF GRACE ABOUNDING 
   NO MISFORTUNE CAN HAPPEN ON EARTH OR IN YOUR SOULS BUT IS RECORDED IN A DECREE BEFORE WE BRING IT INTO EXISTENCE   THAT IS TRULY EASY FOR GOD  
   IN ORDER THAT YE MAY NOT DESPAIR OVER MATTERS THAT PASS YOU BY  NOR EXULT OVER FAVOURS BESTOWED UPON YOU  FOR GOD LOVETH NOT ANY VAINGLORIOUS BOASTER  
   SUCH PERSONS AS ARE COVETOUS AND COMMEND COVETOUSNESS TO MEN  AND IF ANY TURN BACK  FROM GOD S WAY   VERILY GOD IS FREE OF ALL NEEDS  WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE 
   WE SENT AFORETIME OUR APOSTLES WITH CLEAR SIGNS AND SENT DOWN WITH THEM THE BOOK AND THE BALANCE  OF RIGHT AND WRONG   THAT MEN MAY STAND FORTH IN JUSTICE   AND WE SENT DOWN IRON  IN WHICH IS  MATERIAL FOR  MIGHTY WAR  AS WELL AS MANY BENEFITS FOR MANKIND  THAT GOD MAY TEST WHO IT IS THAT WILL HELP  UNSEEN  HIM AND HIS APOSTLES   FOR GOD IS FULL OF STRENGTH  EXALTED IN MIGHT  AND ABLE TO ENFORCE HIS WILL  SECTION  
   AND WE SENT NOAH AND ABRAHAM  AND ESTABLISHED IN THEIR LINE PROPHETHOOD AND REVELATION   AND SOME OF THEM WERE ON RIGHT GUIDANCE  BUT MANY OF THEM BECAME REBELLIOUS TRANSGRESSORS 
   THEN  IN THEIR WAKE  WE FOLLOWED THEM UP WITH  OTHERS OF  OUR APOSTLES   WE SENT AFTER THEM JESUS THE SON OF MARY  AND BESTOWED ON HIM THE GOSPEL   AND WE ORDAINED IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO FOLLOWED HIM COMPASSION AND MERCY  BUT THE MONASTICISM WHICH THEY INVENTED FOR THEMSELVES  WE DID NOT PRESCRIBE FOR THEM    WE COMMANDED  ONLY THE SEEKING FOR THE GOOD PLEASURE OF GOD   BUT THAT THEY DID NOT FOSTER AS THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE  YET WE BESTOWED  ON THOSE AMONG THEM WHO BELIEVED  THEIR  DUE  REWARD  BUT MANY OF THEM ARE REBELLIOUS TRANSGRESSORS 
   O YE THAT BELIEVE   FEAR GOD  AND BELIEVE IN HIS APOSTLE  AND HE WILL BESTOW ON YOU A DOUBLE PORTION OF HIS MERCY   HE WILL PROVIDE FOR YOU A LIGHT BY WHICH YE SHALL WALK  STRAIGHT IN YOUR PATH   AND HE WILL FORGIVE YOU  YOUR PAST    FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL  
   THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK MAY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE NO POWER WHATEVER OVER THE GRACE OF GOD  THAT  HIS  GRACE IS  ENTIRELY  IN HIS HAND  TO BESTOW IT ON WHOMSOEVER HE WILLS  FOR GOD IS THE LORD OF GRACE ABOUNDING 
   GOD HAS INDEED HEARD  AND ACCEPTED  THE STATEMENT OF THE WOMAN WHO PLEADS WITH THEE CONCERNING HER HUSBAND AND CARRIES HER COMPLAINT  IN PRAYER  TO GOD   AND GOD  ALWAYS  HEARS THE ARGUMENTS BETWEEN BOTH SIDES AMONG YOU   FOR GOD HEARS AND SEES  ALL THINGS  
   IF ANY MEN AMONG YOU DIVORCE THEIR WIVES BY ZIHĀR  CALLING THEM MOTHERS   THEY CANNOT BE THEIR MOTHERS   NONE CAN BE THEIR MOTHERS EXCEPT THOSE WHO GAVE THEM BIRTH  AND IN FACT THEY USE WORDS  BOTH  INIQUITOUS AND FALSE   BUT TRULY GOD IS ONE THAT BLOTS OUT  SINS   AND FORGIVES  AGAIN AND AGAIN  
   BUT THOSE WHO DIVORCE THEIR WIVES BY ZIHĀR  THEN WISH TO GO BACK ON THE WORDS THEY UTTERED    IT IS ORDAINED THAT SUCH A ONE  SHOULD FREE A SLAVE BEFORE THEY TOUCH EACH OTHER   THIS ARE YE ADMONISHED TO PERFORM   AND GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH  ALL  THAT YE DO 
   AND IF ANY HAS NOT  THE WHEREWITHAL  HE SHOULD FAST FOR TWO MONTHS CONSECUTIVELY BEFORE THEY TOUCH EACH OTHER  BUT IF ANY IS UNABLE TO DO SO  HE SHOULD FEED SIXTY INDIGENT ONES  THIS  THAT YE MAY SHOW YOUR FAITH IN GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  THOSE ARE LIMITS  SET BY  GOD  FOR THOSE WHO REJECT  HIM   THERE IS A GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   THOSE WHO RESIST GOD AND HIS APOSTLE WILL BE HUMBLED TO DUST  AS WERE THOSE BEFORE THEM   FOR WE HAVE ALREADY SENT DOWN CLEAR SIGNS  AND THE UNBELIEVERS  WILL HAVE  A HUMILIATING PENALTY  
   ON THE DAY THAT GOD WILL RAISE THEM ALL UP  AGAIN  AND SHOW THEM THE TRUTH  AND MEANING  OF THEIR CONDUCT  GOD HAS RECKONED ITS  VALUE   THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN IT  FOR GOD IS WITNESS TO ALL THINGS SECTION  
   SEEST THOU NOT THAT GOD DOTH KNOW  ALL  THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  THERE IS NOT A SECRET CONSULTATION BETWEEN THREE  BUT HE MAKES THE FOURTH AMONG THEM   NOR BETWEEN FIVE BUT HE MAKES THE SIXTH   NOR BETWEEN FEWER NOR MORE  BUT HE IS IN THEIR MIDST  WHERESOEVER THEY BE   IN THE END WILL HE TELL THEM THE TRUTH OF THEIR CONDUCT  ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  FOR GOD HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THINGS 
   TURNEST THOU NOT THY SIGHT TOWARDS THOSE WHO WERE FORBIDDEN SECRET COUNSELS YET REVERT TO THAT WHICH THEY WERE FORBIDDEN  TO DO    AND THEY HOLD SECRET COUNSELS AMONG THEMSELVES FOR INIQUITY AND HOSTILITY  AND DISOBEDIENCE TO THE APOSTLE  AND WHEN THEY COME TO THEE  THEY SALUTE THEE  NOT AS GOD SALUTES THEE  BUT IN CROOKED WAYS    AND THEY SAY TO THEMSELVES   WHY DOES NOT GOD PUNISH US FOR OUR WORDS     ENOUGH FOR THEM IS HELL   IN IT WILL THEY BURN  AND EVIL IS THAT DESTINATION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   WHEN YE HOLD SECRET COUNSEL  DO IT NOT FOR INIQUITY AND HOSTILITY  AND DISOBEDIENCE TO THE PROPHET   BUT DO IT FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SELF RESTRAINT   AND FEAR GOD  TO WHOM YE SHALL BE BROUGHT BACK 
   SECRET COUNSELS ARE ONLY  INSPIRED  BY THE EVIL ONE  IN ORDER THAT HE MAY CAUSE GRIEF TO THE BELIEVERS   BUT HE CANNOT HARM THEM IN THE LEAST  EXCEPT AS GOD PERMITS   AND ON GOD LET THE BELIEVERS PUT THEIR TRUST 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  WHEN YE ARE TOLD TO MAKE ROOM IN THE ASSEMBLIES   SPREAD OUT AND  MAKE ROOM    AMPLE  ROOM WILL GOD PROVIDE FOR YOU  AND WHEN YE ARE TOLD TO RISE UP  RISE UP  GOD WILL RAISE UP  TO  SUITABLE  RANKS  AND DEGREES   THOSE OF YOU WHO BELIEVE AND WHO HAVE BEEN GRANTED  MYSTIC  KNOWLEDGE  AND GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ALL YE DO 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  WHEN YE CONSULT THE APOSTLE IN PRIVATE  SPEND SOMETHING IN CHARITY BEFORE YOUR PRIVATE CONSULTATION  THAT WILL BE BEST FOR YOU  AND MOST CONDUCIVE TO PURITY  OF CONDUCT   BUT IF YE FIND NOT  THE WHEREWITHAL   GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   IS IT THAT YE ARE AFRAID OF SPENDING SUMS IN CHARITY BEFORE YOUR PRIVATE CONSULTATION  WITH HIM    IF  THEN  YE DO NOT SO  AND GOD FORGIVES YOU  THEN  AT LEAST  ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER   PRACTICE REGULAR CHARITY   AND OBEY GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  AND GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THAT YE DO SECTION  
   TURNEST THOU NOT THY ATTENTION TO THOSE WHO TURN  IN FRIENDSHIP  TO SUCH AS HAVE THE WRATH OF GOD UPON THEM   THEY ARE NEITHER OF YOU NOR OF THEM  AND THEY SWEAR TO FALSEHOOD KNOWINGLY 
   GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THEM A SEVERE PENALTY   EVIL INDEED ARE THEIR DEEDS 
   THEY HAVE MADE THEIR OATHS A SCREEN  FOR THEIR MISDEEDS    THUS THEY OBSTRUCT  MEN  FROM THE PATH OF GOD   THEREFORE SHALL THEY HAVE A HUMILIATING PENALTY 
   OF NO PROFIT WHATEVER TO THEM  AGAINST GOD  WILL BE THEIR RICHES NOR THEIR SONS   THEY WILL BE COMPANIONS OF THE FIRE  TO DWELL THEREIN  FOR AYE   
   ONE DAY WILL GOD RAISE THEM ALL UP  FOR JUDGMENT    THEN WILL THEY SWEAR TO HIM AS THEY SWEAR TO YOU   AND THEY THINK THAT THEY HAVE SOMETHING  TO STAND UPON   NO  INDEED   THEY ARE BUT LIARS  
   THE EVIL ONE HAS GOT THE BETTER OF THEM   SO HE HAS MADE THEM LOSE THE REMEMBRANCE OF GOD  THEY ARE THE PARTY OF THE EVIL ONE  TRULY  IT IS THE PARTY OF THE EVIL ONE THAT WILL PERISH  
   THOSE WHO RESIST GOD AND HIS APOSTLE WILL BE AMONG THOSE MOST HUMILIATED 
   GOD HAS DECREED     IT IS I AND MY APOSTLES WHO MUST PREVAIL     FOR GOD IS ONE FULL OF STRENGTH  ABLE TO ENFORCE HIS WILL 
   THOU WILT NOT FIND ANY PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY  LOVING THOSE WHO RESIST GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE THEIR FATHERS OR THEIR SONS  OR THEIR BROTHERS  OR THEIR KINDRED  FOR SUCH HE HAS WRITTEN FAITH IN THEIR HEARTS  AND STRENGTHENED THEM WITH A SPIRIT FROM HIMSELF  AND HE WILL ADMIT THEM TO GARDENS BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW  TO DWELL THEREIN  FOR EVER   GOD WILL BE WELL PLEASED WITH THEM  AND THEY WITH HIM  THEY ARE THE PARTY OF GOD  TRULY IT IS THE PARTY OF GOD THAT WILL ACHIEVE FELICITY 
   WHATEVER IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  LET IT DECLARE THE PRAISES AND GLORY OF GOD   FOR HE IS THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  THE WISE 
   IT IS HE WHO GOT OUT THE UNBELIEVERS AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK FROM THEIR HOMES AT THE FIRST GATHERING  OF THE FORCES   LITTLE DID YE THINK THAT THEY WOULD GET OUT   AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THEIR FORTRESSES WOULD DEFEND THEM FROM GOD   BUT THE  WRATH OF  GOD CAME TO THEM FROM QUARTERS FROM WHICH THEY LITTLE EXPECTED  IT   AND CAST TERROR INTO THEIR HEARTS  SO THAT THEY DESTROYED THEIR DWELLINGS BY THEIR OWN HANDS AND THE HANDS OF THE BELIEVERS  TAKE WARNING  THEN  O YE WITH EYES  TO SEE   
   AND HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT GOD HAS DECREED BANISHMENT FOR THEM  HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE PUNISHED THEM IN THIS WORLD   AND IN THE HEREAFTER THEY SHALL  CERTAINLY  HAVE THE PUNISHMENT OF THE FIRE 
   THAT IS BECAUSE THEY RESISTED GOD AND HIS APOSTLE   AND IF ANY ONE RESISTS GOD  VERILY GOD IS SEVERE IN PUNISHMENT 
   WHETHER YE CUT DOWN  O YE MUSLIMS    THE TENDER PALM TREES  OR YE LEFT THEM STANDING ON THEIR ROOTS  IT WAS BY LEAVE OF GOD  AND IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT COVER WITH SHAME THE REBELLIOUS TRANSGRESSORS 
   WHAT GOD HAS BESTOWED ON HIS APOSTLE  AND TAKEN AWAY  FROM THEM FOR THIS YE MADE NO EXPEDITION WITH EITHER CAVALRY OR CAMELRY   BUT GOD GIVES POWER TO HIS APOSTLES OVER ANY HE PLEASES   AND GOD HAS POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   WHAT GOD HAS BESTOWED ON HIS APOSTLE  AND TAKEN AWAY  FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWNSHIPS  BELONGS TO GOD  TO HIS APOSTLE AND TO KINDRED AND ORPHANS  THE NEEDY AND THE WAYFARER   IN ORDER THAT IT MAY NOT  MERELY  MAKE A CIRCUIT BETWEEN THE WEALTH AMONG YOU  SO TAKE WHAT THE APOSTLE ASSIGNS TO YOU  AND DENY YOURSELVES THAT WHICH HE WITHHOLDS FROM YOU  AND FEAR GOD   FOR GOD IS STRICT IN PUNISHMENT 
    SOME PART IS DUE  TO THE INDIGENT MUHĀJIRS  THOSE WHO WERE EXPELLED FROM THEIR HOMES AND THEIR PROPERTY  WHILE SEEKING GRACE FROM GOD AND  HIS  GOOD PLEASURE  AND AIDING GOD AND HIS APOSTLE   SUCH ARE INDEED THE SINCERE ONES   
   BUT THOSE WHO BEFORE THEM  HAD HOMES  IN MEDINA  AND HAD ADOPTED THE FAITH   SHOW THEIR AFFECTION TO SUCH AS CAME TO THEM FOR REFUGE  AND ENTERTAIN NO DESIRE IN THEIR HEARTS FOR THINGS GIVEN TO THE  LATTER   BUT GIVE THEM PREFERENCE OVER THEMSELVES  EVEN THOUGH POVERTY WAS THEIR  OWN LOT   AND THOSE SAVED FROM THE COVETOUSNESS OF THEIR OWN SOULS  THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ACHIEVE PROSPERITY 
   AND THOSE WHO CAME AFTER THEM SAY     OUR LORD   FORGIVE US  AND OUR BRETHREN WHO CAME BEFORE US INTO THE FAITH  AND LEAVE NOT  IN OUR HEARTS  RANCOUR  OR SENSE OF INJURY  AGAINST THOSE WHO HAVE BELIEVED  OUR LORD   THOU ART INDEED FULL OF KINDNESS  MOST MERCIFUL   SECTION  
   HAST THOU NOT OBSERVED THE HYPOCRITES SAY TO THEIR MISBELIEVING BRETHREN AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK      IF YE ARE EXPELLED  WE TOO WILL GO OUT WITH YOU  AND WE WILL NEVER HEARKEN TO ANY ONE IN YOUR AFFAIR   AND IF YE ARE ATTACKED  IN FIGHT  WE WILL HELP YOU    BUT GOD IS WITNESS THAT THEY ARE INDEED LIARS 
   IF THEY ARE EXPELLED  NEVER WILL THEY GO OUT WITH THEM   AND IF THEY ARE ATTACKED  IN FIGHT   THEY WILL NEVER HELP THEM   AND IF THEY DO HELP THEM  THEY WILL TURN THEIR BACKS   SO THEY WILL RECEIVE NO HELP 
   OF A TRUTH YE ARE STRONGER  THAN THEY  BECAUSE OF THE TERROR IN THEIR HEARTS   SENT  BY GOD  THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE MEN DEVOID OF UNDERSTANDING 
   THEY WILL NOT FIGHT YOU  EVEN  TOGETHER  EXCEPT IN FORTIFIED TOWNSHIPS  OR FROM BEHIND WALLS  STRONG IS THEIR FIGHTING  SPIRIT  AMONGST THEMSELVES   THOU WOULDST THINK THEY WERE UNITED  BUT THEIR HEARTS ARE DIVIDED   THAT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE A PEOPLE DEVOID OF WISDOM 
   LIKE THOSE WHO LATELY PRECEDED THEM  THEY HAVE TASTED THE EVIL RESULT OF THEIR CONDUCT   AND  IN THE HEREAFTER THERE IS  FOR THEM A GRIEVOUS PENALTY   
    THEIR ALLIES DECEIVED THEM   LIKE THE EVIL ONE  WHEN HE SAYS TO MAN    DENY GOD     BUT WHEN  MAN  DENIES GOD   THE EVIL ONE  SAYS    I AM FREE OF THEE   I DO FEAR GOD  THE LORD OF THE WORLDS    
   THE END OF BOTH WILL BE THAT THEY WILL GO INTO THE FIRE  DWELLING THEREIN FOR EVER  SUCH IS THE REWARD OF THE WRONG DOERS SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   FEAR GOD  AND LET EVERY SOUL LOOK TO WHAT  PROVISION  HE HAS SENT FORTH FOR THE MORROW  YEA  FEAR GOD   FOR GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH  ALL  THEY YE DO 
   AND BE YE NOT LIKE THOSE WHO FORGOT GOD   AND HE MADE THEM FORGET THEIR OWN SOULS   SUCH ARE THE REBELLIOUS TRANSGRESSORS  
   NOT EQUAL ARE THE COMPANIONS OF THE FIRE AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE GARDEN   IT IS THE COMPANIONS OF THE GARDEN  THAT WILL ACHIEVE FELICITY 
   HAD WE SENT DOWN THIS QUR ĀN ON A MOUNTAIN  VERILY  THOU WOULD HAVE SEEN IT HUMBLE ITSELF AND CLEAVE ASUNDER FOR FEAR OF GOD  SUCH ARE THE SIMILITUDES WHICH WE PROPOUND TO MEN  THAT THEY MAY REFLECT 
   GOD IS HE  THAN WHOM THERE IS NO OTHER GOD    WHO KNOWS  ALL THINGS  BOTH SECRET AND OPEN   HE  MOST GRACIOUS  MOST MERCIFUL 
   GOD IS HE  THAN WHOM THERE IS NO OTHER GOD    THE SOVEREIGN  THE HOLY ONE  THE SOURCE OF PEACE  AND PERFECTION   THE GUARDIAN OF FAITH  THE PRESERVER OF SAFETY  THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  THE IRRESISTIBLE  THE SUPREME   GLORY TO GOD    HIGH IS HE  ABOVE THE PARTNERS THEY ATTRIBUTE TO HIM 
   HE IS GOD  THE CREATOR  THE EVOLVER  THE BESTOWER OF FORMS  OR COLOURS   TO HIM BELONG THE MOST BEAUTIFUL NAMES   WHATEVER IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  DOTH DECLARE HIS PRAISES AND GLORY   AND HE IS THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  THE WISE 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   TAKE NOT MY ENEMIES AND YOURS AS FRIENDS  OR PROTECTORS   OFFERING THEM  YOUR  LOVE  EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE REJECTED THE TRUTH THAT HAS COME TO YOU  AND HAVE  ON THE CONTRARY  DRIVEN OUT THE PROPHET AND YOURSELVES  FROM YOUR HOMES    SIMPLY  BECAUSE YE BELIEVE IN GOD YOUR LORD   IF YE HAVE COME OUT TO STRIVE IN MY WAY AND TO SEEK MY GOOD PLEASURE   TAKE THEM NOT AS FRIENDS   HOLDING SECRET CONVERSE OF LOVE  AND FRIENDSHIP  WITH THEM   FOR I KNOW FULL WELL ALL THAT YE CONCEAL AND ALL THAT YE REVEAL  AND ANY OF YOU THAT DOES THIS HAS STRAYED FROM THE STRAIGHT PATH 
   IF THEY WERE TO GET THE BETTER OF YOU  THEY WOULD BEHAVE TO YOU AS ENEMIES  AND STRETCH FORTH THEIR HANDS AND THEIR TONGUES AGAINST YOU FOR EVIL   AND THEY DESIRE THAT YE SHOULD REJECT THE TRUTH 
   OF NO PROFIT TO YOU WILL BE YOUR RELATIVES AND YOUR CHILDREN ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT   HE WILL JUDGE BETWEEN YOU   FOR GOD SEES WELL ALL THAT YE DO 
   THERE IS FOR YOU AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE  TO FOLLOW  IN ABRAHAM AND THOSE WITH HIM  WHEN THEY SAID TO THEIR PEOPLE     WE ARE CLEAR OF YOU AND OF WHATEVER YE WORSHIP BESIDES GOD   WE HAVE REJECTED YOU  AND THERE HAS ARISEN  BETWEEN US AND YOU  ENMITY AND HATRED FOR EVER  UNLESS YE BELIEVE IN GOD AND HIM ALONE     BUT NOT WHEN ABRAHAM SAID TO HIS FATHER     I WILL PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS FOR THEE  THOUGH I HAVE NO POWER  TO GET  AUGHT ON THY BEHALF FROM GOD     THEY PRAYED      OUR LORD   IN THEE DO WE TRUST  AND TO THEE DO WE TURN IN REPENTANCE   TO THEE IS  OUR  FINAL GOAL 
     OUR LORD   MAKE US NOT A  TEST AND  TRIAL FOR THE UNBELIEVERS  BUT FORGIVE US  OUR LORD   FOR THOU ART THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  THE WISE   
   THERE WAS INDEED IN THEM AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE FOR YOU TO FOLLOW  FOR THOSE WHOSE HOPE IS IN GOD AND IN THE LAST DAY  BUT IF ANY TURN AWAY  TRULY GOD IS FREE OF ALL WANTS  WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE SECTION  
   IT MAY BE THAT GOD WILL GRANT LOVE  AND FRIENDSHIP  BETWEEN YOU AND THOSE WHOM YE  NOW  HOLD AS ENEMIES  FOR GOD HAS POWER  OVER ALL THINGS    AND GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   GOD FORBIDS YOU NOT  WITH REGARD TO THOSE WHO FIGHT YOU NOT FOR  YOUR  FAITH NOR DRIVE YOU OUT OF YOUR HOMES  FROM DEALING KINDLY AND JUSTLY WITH THEM   FOR GOD LOVETH THOSE WHO ARE JUST 
   GOD ONLY FORBIDS YOU  WITH REGARD TO THOSE WHO FIGHT YOU FOR  YOUR  FAITH  AND DRIVE YOU OUT OF YOUR HOMES  AND SUPPORT  OTHERS  IN DRIVING YOU OUT  FROM TURNING TO THEM  FOR FRIENDSHIP AND PROTECTION   IT IS SUCH AS TURN TO THEM  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES   THAT DO WRONG 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   WHEN THERE COME TO YOU BELIEVING WOMEN REFUGEES  EXAMINE  AND TEST  THEM   GOD KNOWS BEST AS TO THEIR FAITH   IF YE ASCERTAIN THAT THEY ARE BELIEVERS  THEN SEND THEM NOT BACK TO THE UNBELIEVERS  THEY ARE NOT LAWFUL  WIVES  FOR THE UNBELIEVERS  NOR ARE THE  UNBELIEVERS  LAWFUL  HUSBANDS  FOR THEM  BUT PAY THE UNBELIEVERS WHAT THEY HAVE SPENT  ON THEIR DOWER   AND THERE WILL BE NO BLAME ON YOU IF YE MARRY THEM ON PAYMENT OF THEIR DOWER TO THEM  BUT HOLD NOT TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF UNBELIEVING WOMEN   ASK FOR WHAT YE HAVE SPENT ON THEIR DOWERS  AND LET THE  UNBELIEVERS  ASK FOR WHAT THEY HAVE SPENT  ON THE DOWERS OF WOMEN WHO COME OVER TO YOU   SUCH IS THE COMMAND OF GOD   HE JUDGES  WITH JUSTICE  BETWEEN YOU  AND GOD IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM 
   AND IF ANY OF YOUR WIVES DESERTS YOU TO THE UNBELIEVERS  AND YE HAVE AN ACCESSION  BY THE COMING OVER OF A WOMAN FROM THE OTHER SIDE   THEN PAY TO THOSE WHOSE WIVES HAVE DESERTED THE EQUIVALENT OF WHAT THEY HAD SPENT  ON THEIR DOWER   AND FEAR GOD  IN WHOM YE BELIEVE 
   O PROPHET   WHEN BELIEVING WOMEN COME TO THEE TO TAKE THE OATH OF FEALTY TO THEE  THAT THEY WILL NOT ASSOCIATE IN WORSHIP ANY OTHER THING WHATEVER WITH GOD  THAT THEY WILL NOT STEAL  THAT THEY WILL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY  OR FORNICATION   THAT THEY WILL NOT KILL THEIR CHILDREN  THAT THEY WILL NOT UTTER SLANDER  INTENTIONALLY FORGING FALSEHOOD  AND THAT THEY WILL NOT DISOBEY THEE IN ANY JUST MATTER   THEN DO THOU RECEIVE THEIR FEALTY  AND PRAY TO GOD FOR THE FORGIVENESS  OF THEIR SINS    FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   TURN NOT  FOR FRIENDSHIP  TO PEOPLE ON WHOM IS THE WRATH OF GOD  OF THE HEREAFTER THEY ARE ALREADY IN DESPAIR  JUST AS THE UNBELIEVERS ARE IN DESPAIR ABOUT THOSE  BURIED  IN GRAVES 
   WHATEVER IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  LET IT DECLARE THE PRAISES AND GLORY OF GOD   FOR HE IS THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  THE WISE 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   WHY SAY YE THAT WHICH YE DO NOT  
   GRIEVOUSLY ODIOUS IS IT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD THAT YE SAY THAT WHICH YE DO NOT 
   TRULY GOD LOVES THOSE WHO FIGHT IN HIS CAUSE IN BATTLE ARRAY  AS IF THEY WERE A SOLID CEMENTED STRUCTURE 
   AND REMEMBER  MOSES SAID TO HIS PEOPLE     O MY PEOPLE   WHY DO YE VEX AND INSULT ME  THOUGH YE KNOW THAT I AM THE APOSTLE OF GOD  SENT  TO YOU     THEN WHEN THEY WENT WRONG  GOD LET THEIR HEARTS GO WRONG  FOR GOD GUIDES NOT THOSE WHO ARE REBELLIOUS TRANSGRESSORS 
   AND REMEMBER  JESUS  THE SON OF MARY  SAID     O CHILDREN OF ISRAEL   I AM THE APOSTLE OF GOD  SENT  TO YOU  CONFIRMING THE LAW  WHICH CAME  BEFORE ME  AND GIVING GLAD TIDINGS OF AN APOSTLE TO COME AFTER ME  WHOSE NAME SHALL BE AHMAD    BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THEM WITH CLEAR SIGNS  THEY SAID    THIS IS EVIDENT SORCERY    
   WHO DOTH GREATER WRONG THAN ONE WHO INVENTS FALSEHOOD AGAINST GOD  EVEN AS HE IS BEING INVITED TO ISLĀM   AND GOD GUIDES NOT THOSE WHO DO WRONG 
   THEIR INTENTION IS TO EXTINGUISH GOD S LIGHT  BY BLOWING  WITH THEIR MOUTHS   BUT GOD WILL COMPLETE  THE REVELATION OF  HIS LIGHT  EVEN THOUGH THE UNBELIEVERS MAY DETEST  IT  
   IT IS HE WHO HAS SENT HIS APOSTLE WITH GUIDANCE AND THE RELIGION OF TRUTH  THAT HE MAY PROCLAIM IT OVER ALL RELIGION  EVEN THOUGH THE PAGANS MAY DETEST  IT  SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   SHALL I LEAD YOU TO A BARGAIN THAT WILL SAVE YOU FROM A GRIEVOUS PENALTY   
   THAT YE BELIEVE IN GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  AND THAT YE STRIVE  YOUR UTMOST  IN THE CAUSE OF GOD  WITH YOUR PROPERTY AND YOUR PERSONS   THAT WILL BE BEST FOR YOU  IF YE BUT KNEW  
   HE WILL FORGIVE YOU YOUR SINS  AND ADMIT YOU TO GARDENS BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW  AND TO BEAUTIFUL MANSIONS IN GARDENS OF ETERNITY   THAT IS INDEED THE SUPREME ACHIEVEMENT 
   AND ANOTHER  FAVOUR WILL HE BESTOW   WHICH YE DO LOVE    HELP FROM GOD AND A SPEEDY VICTORY  SO GIVE THE GLAD TIDINGS TO THE BELIEVERS 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   BE YE HELPERS OF GOD   AS SAID JESUS THE SON OF MARY TO THE DISCIPLES    WHO WILL BE MY HELPERS TO  THE WORK OF  GOD     SAID THE DISCIPLES     WE ARE GOD S HELPERS     THEN A PORTION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BELIEVED  AND A PORTION DISBELIEVED   BUT WE GAVE POWER TO THOSE WHO BELIEVED  AGAINST THEIR ENEMIES  AND THEY BECAME THE ONES THAT PREVAILED 
   WHATEVER IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  DOTH DECLARE THE PRAISES AND GLORY OF GOD   THE SOVEREIGN  THE HOLY ONE  THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  THE WISE 
   IT IS HE WHO HAS SENT AMONGST THE UNLETTERED AN APOSTLE FROM AMONG THEMSELVES  TO REHEARSE TO THEM HIS SIGNS  TO SANCTIFY THEM  AND TO INSTRUCT THEM IN SCRIPTURE AND WISDOM   ALTHOUGH THEY HAD BEEN  BEFORE  IN MANIFEST ERROR   
   AS WELL AS  TO CONFER ALL THESE BENEFITS UPON  OTHERS OF THEM  WHO HAVE NOT ALREADY JOINED THEM   AND HE IS EXALTED IN MIGHT  WISE 
   SUCH IS THE BOUNTY OF GOD  WHICH HE BESTOWS ON WHOM HE WILL   AND GOD IS THE LORD OF THE HIGHEST BOUNTY 
   THE SIMILITUDE OF THOSE WHO WERE CHARGED WITH THE  OBLIGATIONS OF THE  MOSAIC LAW  BUT WHO SUBSEQUENTLY FAILED IN THOSE  OBLIGATIONS   IS THAT OF A DONKEY WHICH CARRIES HUGE TOMES  BUT UNDERSTANDS THEM NOT   EVIL IS THE SIMILITUDE OF PEOPLE WHO FALSIFY THE SIGNS OF GOD   AND GOD GUIDES NOT PEOPLE WHO DO WRONG 
   SAY    O YE THAT STAND ON JUDAISM   IF YE THINK THAT YE ARE FRIENDS TO GOD  TO THE EXCLUSION OF  OTHER  MEN  THEN EXPRESS YOUR DESIRE FOR DEATH  IF YE ARE TRUTHFUL   
   BUT NEVER WILL THEY EXPRESS THEIR DESIRE  FOR DEATH   BECAUSE OF THE  DEEDS  THEIR HANDS HAVE SENT ON BEFORE THEM   AND GOD KNOWS WELL THOSE THAT DO WRONG  
   SAY     THE DEATH FROM WHICH YE FLEE WILL TRULY OVERTAKE YOU   THEN WILL YE BE SENT BACK TO THE KNOWER OF THINGS SECRET AND OPEN   AND HE WILL TELL YOU  THE TRUTH OF  THE THINGS THAT YE DID    SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   WHEN THE CALL IS PROCLAIMED TO PRAYER ON FRIDAY  THE DAY OF ASSEMBLY   HASTEN EARNESTLY TO THE REMEMBRANCE OF GOD  AND LEAVE OFF BUSINESS  AND TRAFFIC    THAT IS BEST FOR YOU IF YE BUT KNEW  
   AND WHEN THE PRAYER IS FINISHED  THEN MAY YE DISPERSE THROUGH THE LAND  AND SEEK OF THE BOUNTY OF GOD   AND CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF GOD OFTEN  AND WITHOUT STINT    THAT YE MAY PROSPER 
   BUT WHEN THEY SEE SOME BARGAIN OR SOME AMUSEMENT  THEY DISPERSE HEADLONG TO IT  AND LEAVE THEE STANDING  SAY     THE  BLESSING  FROM THE PRESENCE OF GOD IS BETTER THAN ANY AMUSEMENT OR BARGAIN   AND GOD IS THE BEST TO PROVIDE  FOR ALL NEEDS   
   WHEN THE HYPOCRITES COME TO THEE  THEY SAY    WE BEAR WITNESS THAT THOU ART INDEED THE APOSTLE OF GOD    YEA  GOD KNOWETH THAT THOU ART INDEED HIS APOSTLE  AND GOD BEARETH WITNESS THAT THE HYPOCRITES ARE INDEED LIARS 
   THEY HAVE MADE THEIR OATHS A SCREEN  FOR THEIR MISDEEDS   THUS THEY OBSTRUCT  MEN  FROM THE PATH OF GOD  TRULY EVIL ARE THEIR DEEDS 
   THAT IS BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED  THEN THEY REJECTED FAITH  SO A SEAL WAS SET ON THEIR HEARTS  THEREFORE THEY UNDERSTAND NOT 
   WHEN THOU LOOKEST AT THEM  THEIR EXTERIORS PLEASE THEE  AND WHEN THEY SPEAK  THOU LISTENEST TO THEIR WORDS  THEY ARE AS  WORTHLESS AS HOLLOW  PIECES OF TIMBER PROPPED UP   UNABLE TO STAND ON THEIR OWN   THEY THINK THAT EVERY CRY IS AGAINST THEM  THEY ARE THE ENEMIES  SO BEWARE OF THEM  THE CURSE OF GOD BE ON THEM  HOW ARE THEY DELUDED  AWAY FROM THE TRUTH  
   AND WHEN IT IS SAID TO THEM    COME  THE APOSTLE OF GOD WILL PRAY FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS    THEY TURN ASIDE THEIR HEADS  AND THOU WOULDST SEE THEM TURNING AWAY THEIR FACES IN ARROGANCE 
   IT IS EQUAL TO THEM WHETHER THOU PRAY FOR THEIR FORGIVENESS OR NOT  GOD WILL NOT FORGIVE THEM  TRULY GOD GUIDES NOT REBELLIOUS TRANSGRESSORS 
   THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SAY    SPEND NOTHING ON THOSE WHO ARE WITH GOD S APOSTLE  TO THE END THAT THEY MAY DISPERSE  AND QUIT MEDINAH     BUT TO GOD BELONG THE TREASURES OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  BUT THE HYPOCRITES UNDERSTAND NOT 
   THEY SAY    IF WE RETURN TO MEDINAH  SURELY THE MORE HONOURABLE  ELEMENT  WILL EXPEL THEREFROM THE MEANER    BUT HONOUR BELONGS TO GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  AND TO THE BELIEVERS  BUT THE HYPOCRITES KNOW NOT SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  LET NOT YOUR RICHES OR YOUR CHILDREN DIVERT YOU FROM THE REMEMBRANCE OF GOD  IF ANY ACT THUS  THE LOSS IS THEIR OWN 
   AND SPEND SOMETHING  IN CHARITY  OUT OF THE SUBSTANCE WHICH WE HAVE BESTOWED ON YOU  BEFORE DEATH SHOULD COME TO ANY OF YOU AND HE SHOULD SAY    O MY LORD   WHY DIDST THOU NOT GIVE ME RESPITE FOR A LITTLE WHILE  I SHOULD THEN HAVE GIVEN  LARGELY  IN CHARITY  AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE DOERS OF GOOD   
   BUT TO NO SOUL WILL GOD GRANT RESPITE WHEN THE TIME APPOINTED  FOR IT  HAS COME  AND GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH  ALL  THAT YE DO 
   WHATEVER IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH  DOTH DECLARE THE PRAISES AND GLORY OF GOD   TO HIM BELONGS DOMINION  AND TO HIM BELONGS PRAISE   AND HE HAS POWER OVER ALL THINGS 
   IT IS HE WHO HAS CREATED YOU   AND OF YOU ARE SOME THAT ARE UNBELIEVERS  AND SOME THAT ARE BELIEVERS   AND GOD SEES WELL ALL THAT YE DO 
   HE HAS CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH IN JUST PROPORTIONS  AND HAS GIVEN YOU SHAPE  AND MADE YOUR SHAPES BEAUTIFUL   AND TO HIM IS THE FINAL GOAL 
   HE KNOWS WHAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH   AND HE KNOWS WHAT YE CONCEAL AND WHAT YE REVEAL   YEA  GOD KNOWS WELL THE  SECRETS  OF  ALL  HEARTS 
   HAS NOT THE STORY REACHED YOU  OF THOSE WHO REJECTED FAITH AFORETIME  SO THEY TASTED THE EVIL RESULT OF THEIR CONDUCT   AND THEY HAD A GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   THAT WAS BECAUSE THERE CAME TO THEM APOSTLES WITH CLEAR SIGNS  BUT THEY SAID    SHALL  MERE  HUMAN BEINGS DIRECT US   SO THEY REJECTED  THE MESSAGE  AND TURNED AWAY  BUT GOD CAN DO WITHOUT  THEM    AND GOD IS FREE OF ALL NEEDS  WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE 
   THE UNBELIEVERS THINK THAT THEY WILL NOT BE RAISED UP  FOR JUDGMENT   SAY    YEA  BY MY LORD  YE SHALL SURELY BE RAISED UP   THEN SHALL YE BE TOLD  THE TRUTH  OF ALL THAT YE DID  AND THAT IS EASY FOR GOD  
   BELIEVE  THEREFORE  IN GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  AND IN THE LIGHT WHICH WE HAVE SENT DOWN  AND GOD IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THAT YE DO 
   THE DAY THAT HE ASSEMBLES YOU  ALL  FOR A DAY OF ASSEMBLY   THAT WILL BE A DAY OF MUTUAL LOSS AND GAIN  AMONG YOU   AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS   HE WILL REMOVE FROM THEM THEIR ILLS  AND HE WILL ADMIT THEM TO GARDENS BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW  TO DWELL THEREIN FOR EVER   THAT WILL BE THE SUPREME ACHIEVEMENT 
   BUT THOSE WHO REJECT FAITH AND TREAT OUR SIGNS AS FALSEHOODS  THEY WILL BE COMPANIONS OF THE FIRE  TO DWELL THEREIN FOR AYE   AND EVIL IS THAT GOAL SECTION  
   NO KIND OF CALAMITY CAN OCCUR  EXCEPT BY THE LEAVE OF GOD   AND IF ANY ONE BELIEVES IN GOD   GOD  GUIDES HIS HEART  ARIGHT    FOR GOD KNOWS ALL THINGS 
   SO OBEY GOD  AND OBEY HIS APOSTLE   BUT IF YE TURN BACK  THE DUTY OF OUR APOSTLE IS BUT TO PROCLAIM  THE MESSAGE  CLEARLY AND OPENLY 
   GOD  THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE   AND ON GOD  THEREFORE  LET THE BELIEVERS PUT THEIR TRUST 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE   TRULY  AMONG YOUR WIVES AND YOUR CHILDREN ARE  SOME THAT ARE  ENEMIES TO YOURSELVES   SO BEWARE OF THEM  BUT IF YE FORGIVE AND OVERLOOK  AND COVER UP  THEIR FAULTS  VERILY GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   YOUR RICHES AND YOUR CHILDREN MAY BE BUT A TRIAL   BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD  IS THE HIGHEST REWARD 
   SO FEAR GOD AS MUCH AS YE CAN   LISTEN AND OBEY   AND SPEND IN CHARITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOUR OWN SOULS  AND THOSE SAVED FROM THE COVETOUSNESS OF THEIR OWN SOULS   THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ACHIEVE PROSPERITY 
   IF YE LOAN TO GOD A BEAUTIFUL LOAN  HE WILL DOUBLE IT TO YOUR  CREDIT   AND HE WILL GRANT YOU FORGIVENESS   FOR GOD IS MOST READY TO APPRECIATE  SERVICE   MOST FORBEARING  
   KNOWER OF WHAT IS HIDDEN AND WHAT IS OPEN  EXALTED IN MIGHT  FULL OF WISDOM 
   O PROPHET   WHEN YE DO DIVORCE WOMEN  DIVORCE THEM AT THEIR PRESCRIBED PERIODS  AND COUNT  ACCURATELY  THEIR PRESCRIBED PERIODS   AND FEAR GOD YOUR LORD   AND TURN THEM NOT OUT OF THEIR HOUSES  NOR SHALL THEY  THEMSELVES  LEAVE  EXCEPT IN CASE THEY ARE GUILTY OF SOME OPEN LEWDNESS  THOSE ARE LIMITS  SET BY GOD   AND ANY WHO TRANSGRESSES THE LIMITS OF GOD  DOES VERILY WRONG HIS  OWN  SOUL   THOU KNOWEST NOT IF PERCHANCE GOD WILL BRING ABOUT THEREAFTER SOME NEW SITUATION 
   THUS WHEN THEY FULFILL THEIR TERM APPOINTED  EITHER TAKE THEM BACK ON EQUITABLE TERMS OR PART WITH THEM ON EQUITABLE TERMS   AND TAKE FOR WITNESS TWO PERSONS FROM AMONG YOU  ENDUED WITH JUSTICE  AND ESTABLISH THE EVIDENCE  AS  BEFORE GOD  SUCH IS THE ADMONITION GIVEN TO HIM WHO BELIEVES IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY  AND FOR THOSE WHO FEAR GOD  HE  EVER  PREPARES A WAY OUT 
   AND HE PROVIDES FOR HIM FROM  SOURCES  HE NEVER COULD IMAGINE  AND IF ANY ONE PUTS HIS TRUST IN GOD  SUFFICIENT IS  GOD  FOR HIM  FOR GOD WILL SURELY ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE   VERILY FOR ALL THINGS HAS GOD APPOINTED A DUE PROPORTION 
   SUCH OF YOUR WOMEN AS HAVE PASSED THE AGE OF MONTHLY COURSES  FOR THEM THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD  IF YE HAVE ANY DOUBTS  IS THREE MONTHS  AND FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NO COURSES  IT IS THE SAME    FOR THOSE WHO CARRY  LIFE WITHIN THEIR WOMBS   THEIR PERIOD IS UNTIL THEY DELIVER THEIR BURDENS   AND FOR THOSE WHO FEAR GOD  HE WILL MAKE THEIR PATH EASY 
   THAT IS THE COMMAND OF GOD  WHICH HE HAS SENT DOWN TO YOU   AND IF ANY ONE FEARS GOD  HE WILL REMOVE HIS ILLS FROM HIM  AND WILL ENLARGE HIS REWARD 
   LET THE WOMEN LIVE  IN  IDDAT  IN THE SAME STYLE AS YE LIVE  ACCORDING TO YOUR MEANS   ANNOY THEM NOT  SO AS TO RESTRICT THEM  AND IF THEY CARRY  LIFE IN THEIR WOMBS   THEN SPEND  YOUR SUBSTANCE  ON THEM UNTIL THEY DELIVER THEIR BURDEN   AND IF THEY SUCKLE YOUR  OFFSPRING   GIVE THEM THEIR RECOMPENSE   AND TAKE MUTUAL COUNSEL TOGETHER  ACCORDING TO WHAT IS JUST AND REASONABLE  AND IF YE FIND YOURSELVES IN DIFFICULTIES  LET ANOTHER WOMAN SUCKLE  THE CHILD  ON THE  FATHER S  BEHALF 
   LET THE MAN OF MEANS SPEND ACCORDING TO HIS MEANS   AND THE MAN WHOSE RESOURCES ARE RESTRICTED  LET HIM SPEND ACCORDING TO WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN HIM  GOD PUTS NO BURDEN ON ANY PERSON BEYOND WHAT HE HAS GIVEN HIM  AFTER A DIFFICULTY  GOD WILL SOON GRANT RELIEF SECTION  
   HOW MANY POPULATIONS THAT INSOLENTLY OPPOSED THE COMMAND OF THEIR LORD AND OF HIS APOSTLES  DID WE NOT THEN CALL TO ACCOUNT   TO SEVERE ACCOUNT   AND WE IMPOSED ON THEM AN EXEMPLARY PUNISHMENT 
   THEN DID THEY TASTE THE EVIL RESULT OF THEIR CONDUCT  AND THE END OF THEIR CONDUCT WAS PERDITION 
   GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THEM A SEVERE PUNISHMENT  IN THE HEREAFTER   THEREFORE FEAR GOD  O YE MEN OF UNDERSTANDING  WHO HAVE BELIEVED   FOR GOD HATH INDEED SENT DOWN TO YOU A MESSAGE
   AN APOSTLE  WHO REHEARSES TO YOU THE SIGNS OF GOD CONTAINING CLEAR EXPLANATIONS  THAT HE MAY LEAD FORTH THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND DO RIGHTEOUS DEEDS FROM THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS INTO LIGHT  AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS  HE WILL ADMIT TO GARDENS BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW  TO DWELL THEREIN FOR EVER   GOD HAS INDEED GRANTED FOR THEM A MOST EXCELLENT PROVISION 
   GOD IS HE WHO CREATED SEVEN FIRMAMENTS AND OF THE EARTH A SIMILAR NUMBER  THROUGH THE MIDST OF THEM  ALL  DESCENDS HIS COMMAND   THAT YE MAY KNOW THAT GOD HAS POWER OVER ALL THINGS  AND THAT GOD COMPREHENDS ALL THINGS IN  HIS  KNOWLEDGE 
   O PROPHET   WHY HOLDEST THOU TO BE FORBIDDEN THAT WHICH GOD HAS MADE LAWFUL TO THEE   THOU SEEKEST TO PLEASE THY CONSORTS  BUT GOD IS OFT  FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   GOD HAS ALREADY ORDAINED FOR YOU   O MEN   THE DISSOLUTION OF YOUR OATHS  IN SOME CASES    AND GOD IS YOUR PROTECTOR  AND HE IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM 
   WHEN THE PROPHET DISCLOSED A MATTER IN CONFIDENCE TO ONE OF HIS CONSORTS AND SHE THEN DIVULGED IT  TO ANOTHER   AND GOD MADE IT KNOWN TO HIM  HE CONFIRMED PART THEREOF AND REPUDIATED A PART  THEN WHEN HE TOLD HER THEREOF  SHE SAID    WHO TOLD THEE THIS     HE SAID    HE TOLD ME WHO KNOWS AND IS WELL ACQUAINTED  WITH ALL THINGS   
   IF YE TWO TURN IN REPENTANCE TO HIM  YOUR HEARTS ARE INDEED SO INCLINED   BUT IF YE BACK UP EACH OTHER AGAINST HIM  TRULY GOD IS HIS PROTECTOR  AND GABRIEL  AND  EVERY  RIGHTEOUS ONE AMONG THOSE WHO BELIEVE   AND FURTHERMORE  THE ANGELS  WILL BACK  HIM  UP 
   IT MAY BE  IF HE DIVORCED YOU  ALL   THAT GOD WILL GIVE HIM IN EXCHANGE CONSORTS BETTER THAN YOU   WHO SUBMIT  THEIR WILLS   WHO BELIEVE  WHO ARE DEVOUT  WHO TURN TO GOD IN REPENTANCE  WHO WORSHIP  IN HUMILITY   WHO TRAVEL  FOR FAITH  AND FAST   PREVIOUSLY MARRIED OR VIRGINS 
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  SAVE YOURSELVES AND YOUR FAMILIES FROM A FIRE WHOSE FUEL IS MEN AND STONES  OVER WHICH ARE  APPOINTED  ANGELS STERN  AND  SEVERE  WHO FLINCH NOT  FROM EXECUTING  THE COMMANDS THEY RECEIVE FROM GOD  BUT DO  PRECISELY  WHAT THEY ARE COMMANDED 
    THEY WILL SAY     O YE UNBELIEVERS   MAKE NO EXCUSES THIS DAY   YE ARE BEING BUT REQUITED FOR ALL THAT YE DID    SECTION  
   O YE WHO BELIEVE  TURN TO GOD WITH SINCERE REPENTANCE   IN THE HOPE THAT YOUR LORD WILL REMOVE FROM YOU YOUR ILLS AND ADMIT YOU TO GARDENS BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW   THE DAY THAT GOD WILL NOT PERMIT TO BE HUMILIATED THE PROPHET AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE WITH HIM  THEIR LIGHT WILL RUN FORWARD BEFORE THEM AND BY THEIR RIGHT HANDS  WHILE THEY SAY    OUR LORD   PERFECT OUR LIGHT FOR US  AND GRANT US FORGIVENESS   FOR THOU HAST POWER OVER ALL THINGS   
   O PROPHET   STRIVE HARD AGAINST THE UNBELIEVERS AND THE HYPOCRITES  AND BE FIRM AGAINST THEM  THEIR ABODE IS HELL   AN EVIL REFUGE  INDEED  
   GOD SETS FORTH  FOR AN EXAMPLE TO THE UNBELIEVERS  THE WIFE OF NOAH AND THE WIFE OF LŪṬ   THEY WERE  RESPECTIVELY  UNDER TWO OF OUR RIGHTEOUS SERVANTS  BUT THEY WERE FALSE TO THEIR  HUSBANDS   AND THEY PROFITED NOTHING BEFORE GOD ON THEIR ACCOUNT  BUT WERE TOLD     ENTER YE THE FIRE ALONG WITH  OTHERS  THAT ENTER    
   AND GOD SETS FORTH  AS AN EXAMPLE TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE  THE WIFE OF PHARAOH   BEHOLD SHE SAID     O MY LORD   BUILD FOR ME  IN NEARNESS TO THEE  A MANSION IN THE GARDEN  AND SAVE ME FROM PHARAOH AND HIS DOINGS AND SAVE ME FROM THOSE THAT DO WRONG    
   AND MARY THE DAUGHTER OF   IMRAN  WHO GUARDED HER CHASTITY  AND WE BREATHED INTO  HER BODY  OF OUR SPIRIT   AND SHE TESTIFIED TO THE TRUTH OF THE WORDS OF HER LORD AND OF HIS REVELATIONS  AND WAS ONE OF THE DEVOUT  SERVANTS  
   BLESSED BE HE IN WHOSE HANDS IS DOMINION   AND HE OVER ALL THINGS HATH POWER   
    HE WHO CREATED DEATH AND LIFE  THAT HE MAY TRY WHICH OF YOU IS BEST IN DEED   AND HE IS THE EXALTED IN MIGHT  OFT FORGIVING   
    HE WHO CREATED THE SEVEN HEAVENS ONE ABOVE ANOTHER   NO WANT OF PROPORTION WILT THOU SEE IN THE CREATION OF  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  SO TURN THY VISION AGAIN   SEEST THOU ANY FLAW  
    AGAIN TURN THY VISION A SECOND TIME    THY  VISION WILL COME BACK TO THEE DULL AND DISCOMFITED  IN A STATE WORN OUT 
    AND WE HAVE   FROM OF OLD   ADORNED THE LOWEST HEAVEN WITH LAMPS  AND WE HAVE MADE SUCH  LAMPS   AS  MISSILES TO DRIVE AWAY THE EVIL ONES  AND HAVE PREPARED FOR THEM THE PENALTY OF THE BLAZING FIRE 
    FOR THOSE WHO REJECT THEIR LORD  AND CHERISHER  IS THE PENALTY OF HELL   AND EVIL IS  SUCH  DESTINATION 
    WHEN THEY ARE CAST THEREIN  THEY WILL HEAR THE  TERRIBLE  DRAWING IN OF ITS BREATH EVEN AS IT BLAZES FORTH 
    ALMOST BURSTING WITH FURY   EVERY TIME A GROUP IS CAST THEREIN  ITS KEEPERS WILL ASK    DID NO WARNER COME TO YOU    
    THEY WILL SAY   YES INDEED   A WARNER DID COME TO US  BUT WE REJECTED HIM AND SAID    GOD NEVER SENT DOWN ANY  MESSAGE    YE ARE IN NOTHING BUT AN EGREGIOUS DELUSION      
   THEY WILL FURTHER SAY     HAD WE BUT LISTENED OR USED OUR INTELLIGENCE  WE SHOULD NOT  NOW  BE AMONG THE COMPANIONS OF THE BLAZING FIRE    
   THEY WILL THEN CONFESS THEIR SINS   BUT FAR WILL BE  FORGIVENESS  FROM THE COMPANIONS OF THE BLAZING FIRE 
   AS FOR THOSE WHO FEAR THEIR LORD UNSEEN  FOR THEM IS FORGIVENESS AND A GREAT REWARD 
   AND WHETHER YE HIDE YOUR WORD OR PUBLISH IT  HE CERTAINLY HAS  FULL  KNOWLEDGE  OF THE SECRETS OF  ALL  HEARTS 
   SHOULD HE NOT KNOW   HE THAT CREATED   AND HE IS THE ONE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE FINEST MYSTERIES  AND  IS WELL ACQUAINTED  WITH THEM  SECTION  
   IT IS HE WHO HAS MADE THE EARTH MANAGEABLE FOR YOU  SO TRAVERSE YE THROUGH ITS TRACTS AND ENJOY OF THE SUSTENANCE WHICH HE FURNISHES   BUT UNTO HIM IS THE RESURRECTION 
   DO YE FEEL SECURE THAT HE WHO IS IN HEAVEN WILL NOT CAUSE YOU TO BE SWALLOWED UP BY THE EARTH WHEN IT SHAKES  AS IN AN EARTHQUAKE   
   OR DO YE FEEL SECURE THAT HE WHO IS IN HEAVEN WILL NOT SEND AGAINST YOU A VIOLENT TORNADO  WITH SHOWERS OF STONES   SO THAT YE SHALL KNOW HOW  TERRIBLE  WAS MY WARNING  
   BUT INDEED MEN BEFORE THEM REJECTED  MY WARNING    THEN HOW  TERRIBLE  WAS MY REJECTION  OF THEM   
   DO THEY NOT OBSERVE THE BIRDS ABOVE THEM  SPREADING THEIR WINGS AND FOLDING THEM IN   NONE CAN UPHOLD THEM EXCEPT  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS   TRULY IT IS HE THAT WATCHES OVER ALL THINGS 
   NAY  WHO IS THERE THAT CAN HELP YOU   EVEN AS  AN ARMY  BESIDES  GOD  MOST MERCIFUL   IN NOTHING BUT DELUSION ARE THE UNBELIEVERS 
   OR WHO IS THERE THAT CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH SUSTENANCE IF HE WERE TO WITHHOLD HIS PROVISION   NAY  THEY OBSTINATELY PERSIST IN INSOLENT IMPIETY AND FLIGHT  FROM THE TRUTH  
   IS THEN ONE WHO WALKS HEADLONG  WITH HIS FACE GROVELLING  BETTER GUIDED   OR ONE WHO WALKS EVENLY ON A STRAIGHT WAY  
   SAY     IT IS HE WHO HAS CREATED YOU  AND MADE YOU GROW   AND MADE FOR YOU THE FACULTIES OF HEARING  SEEING  FEELING AND UNDERSTANDING   LITTLE THANKS IT IS YE GIVE  
   SAY     IT IS HE WHO HAS MULTIPLIED YOU THROUGH THE EARTH  AND TO HIM SHALL YE BE GATHERED TOGETHER   
   THEY ASK   WHEN WILL THIS PROMISE BE  FULFILLED     IF YE ARE TELLING THE TRUTH 
   SAY     AS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TIME  IT IS WITH GOD ALONE   I AM  SENT  ONLY TO WARN PLAINLY IN PUBLIC   
   AT LENGTH  WHEN THEY SEE IT CLOSE AT HAND  GRIEVED WILL BE THE FACES OF THE UNBELIEVERS  AND IT WILL BE SAID  TO THEM      THIS IS  THE PROMISE FULFILLED   WHICH YE WERE CALLING FOR    
   SAY     SEE YE   IF GOD WERE TO DESTROY ME  AND THOSE WITH ME  OR IF HE BESTOWS HIS MERCY ON US   YET WHO CAN DELIVER THE UNBELIEVERS FROM A GRIEVOUS PENALTY  
   SAY     HE IS  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS   WE HAVE BELIEVED IN HIM  AND ON HIM HAVE WE PUT OUR TRUST   SO  SOON WILL YE KNOW WHICH  OF US  IT IS THAT IS IN MANIFEST ERROR   
   SAY    SEE YE    IF YOUR STREAM BE SOME MORNING LOST  IN THE UNDERGROUND EARTH   WHO THEN CAN SUPPLY YOU WITH CLEAR FLOWING WATER    
   NUN  BY THE PEN AND BY THE  RECORD  WHICH  MEN  WRITE  
   THOU ART NOT  BY THE GRACE OF THY LORD  MAD OR POSSESSED 
   NAY  VERILY FOR THEE IS A REWARD UNFAILING  
   AND THOU  STANDEST  ON AN EXALTED STANDARD OF CHARACTER 
   SOON WILT THOU SEE  AND THEY WILL SEE 
   WHICH OF YOU IS AFFLICTED WITH MADNESS 
   VERILY IT IS THY LORD THAT KNOWETH BEST  WHICH  AMONG MEN  HATH STRAYED FROM HIS PATH   AND HE KNOWETH BEST THOSE WHO RECEIVE  TRUE  GUIDANCE 
   SO HEARKEN NOT TO THOSE WHO DENY  THE TRUTH  
   THEIR DESIRE IS THAT THOU SHOULDST BE PLIANT   SO WOULD THEY BE PLIANT 
   NEED NOT THE TYPE OF DESPICABLE MAN   READY WITH OATHS 
   A SLANDERER  GOING ABOUT WITH CALUMNIES 
    HABITUALLY  HINDERING  ALL  GOOD  TRANSGRESSING BEYOND BOUNDS  DEEP IN SIN 
   VIOLENT  AND CRUEL    WITH ALL THAT  BASE BORN  
   BECAUSE HE POSSESSES WEALTH AND  NUMEROUS  SONS 
   WHEN TO HIM ARE REHEARSED OUR SIGNS    TALES OF THE ANCIENTS    HE CRIES  
   SOON SHALL WE BRAND  THE BEAST  ON THE SNOUT  
   VERILY WE HAVE TRIED THEM AS WE TRIED THE PEOPLE OF THE GARDEN  WHEN THEY RESOLVED TO GATHER THE FRUITS OF THE  GARDEN  IN THE MORNING 
   BUT MADE NO RESERVATION     IF IT BE GOD S WILL    
   THEN THERE CAME ON THE  GARDEN  A VISITATION FROM THY LORD   WHICH SWEPT AWAY  ALL AROUND  WHILE THEY WERE ASLEEP 
   SO THE  GARDEN  BECAME  BY THE MORNING  LIKE A DARK AND DESOLATE SPOT   WHOSE FRUIT HAD BEEN GATHERED  
   AS THE MORNING BROKE  THEY CALLED OUT  ONE TO ANOTHER  
     GO YE TO YOUR TILTH  BETIMES  IN MORNING  IF YE WOULD GATHER THE FRUITS   
   SO THEY DEPARTED  CONVERSING IN SECRET LOW TONES   SAYING  
     LET NOT A SINGLE INDIGENT PERSON BREAK IN UPON YOU INTO THE  GARDEN  THIS DAY   
   AND THEY OPENED THE MORNING  STRONG IN AN  UNJUST  RESOLVE 
   BUT WHEN THEY SAW THE  GARDEN   THEY SAID    WE HAVE SURELY LOST OUR WAY  
    INDEED WE ARE SHUT OUT  OF THE FRUITS OF OUR LABOR    
   SAID ONE OF THEM  MORE JUST  THAN THE REST      DID I NOT SAY TO YOU    WHY NOT GLORIFY  GOD       
   THEY SAID    GLORY TO OUR LORD  VERILY WE HAVE BEEN DOING WRONG    
   THEN THEY TURNED  ONE AGAINST ANOTHER  IN REPROACH 
   THEY SAID    ALAS FOR US   WE HAVE INDEED TRANSGRESSED  
     IT MAY BE THAT OUR LORD WILL GIVE US IN EXCHANGE A BETTER  GARDEN  THAN THIS   FOR WE DO TURN TO HIM  IN REPENTANCE     
   SUCH IS THE PUNISHMENT  IN THIS LIFE    BUT GREATER IS THE PUNISHMENT IN THE HEREAFTER   IF ONLY THEY KNEW  SECTION  
   VERILY  FOR THE RIGHTEOUS  ARE GARDENS OF DELIGHT  IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR LORD 
   SHALL WE THEN TREAT THE PEOPLE OF FAITH LIKE THE PEOPLE OF SIN  
   WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU   HOW JUDGE YE  
   OR HAVE YE A BOOK THROUGH WHICH YE LEARN 
   THAT YE SHALL HAVE  THROUGH IT WHATEVER YE CHOOSE  
   OR HAVE YE COVENANTS WITH US ON OATH  REACHING TO THE DAY OF JUDGMENT   PROVIDING  THAT YE SHALL HAVE WHATEVER YE SHALL DEMAND  
   ASK THOU OF THEM  WHICH OF THEM WILL STAND SURETY FOR THAT  
   OR HAVE THEY SOME   PARTNERS    IN GODHEAD    THEN LET THEM PRODUCE THEIR   PARTNERS    IF THEY ARE TRUTHFUL  
   THE DAY THAT THE SHIN SHALL BE LAID BARE  AND THEY SHALL BE SUMMONED TO BOW IN ADORATION  BUT THEY SHALL NOT BE ABLE  
   THEIR EYES WILL BE CAST DOWN   IGNOMINY WILL COVER THEM   SEEING THAT THEY HAD BEEN SUMMONED AFORETIME TO BOW IN ADORATION  WHILE THEY WERE WHOLE   AND HAD REFUSED  
   THEN LEAVE ME ALONE WITH SUCH AS REJECT THIS MESSAGE   BY DEGREES SHALL WE PUNISH THEM FROM DIRECTIONS THEY PERCEIVE NOT 
   A  LONG  RESPITE WILL I GRANT THEM   TRULY POWERFUL IS MY PLAN 
   OR IS IT THAT THOU DOST ASK THEM FOR A REWARD  SO THAT THEY ARE BURDENED WITH A LOAD OF DEBT   
   OR THAT THE UNSEEN IS IN THEIR HANDS  SO THAT THEY CAN WRITE IT DOWN  
   SO WAIT WITH PATIENCE FOR THE COMMAND OF THY LORD  AND BE NOT LIKE THE COMPANION OF THE FISH   WHEN HE CRIED OUT IN AGONY 
   HAD NOT GRACE FROM HIS LORD REACHED HIM  HE WOULD INDEED HAVE BEEN CAST OFF ON THE NAKED SHORE  IN DISGRACE 
   THUS DID HIS LORD CHOOSE HIM AND MAKE HIM OF THE COMPANY OF THE RIGHTEOUS 
   AND THE UNBELIEVERS WOULD ALMOST TRIP THEE UP WITH THEIR EYES WHEN THEY HEAR THE MESSAGE   AND THEY SAY     SURELY HE IS POSSESSED    
   BUT IT IS NOTHING LESS THAN A MESSAGE TO ALL THE WORLDS 
   THE SURE REALITY  
   WHAT IS THE SURE REALITY  
   AND WHAT WILL MAKE THEE REALISE WHAT THE SURE REALITY IS  
   THE THAMŪD AND THE  ĀD PEOPLE  BRANDED  AS FALSE THE STUNNING CALAMITY 
   BUT THE THAMŪD   THEY WERE DESTROYED BY A TERRIBLE STORM OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING  
   AND THE  ĀD   THEY WERE DESTROYED BY A FURIOUS WIND  EXCEEDINGLY VIOLENT  
   HE MADE IT RAGE AGAINST THEM SEVEN NIGHTS AND EIGHT DAYS IN SUCCESSION   SO THAT THOU COULDST SEE THE  WHOLE  PEOPLE LYING PROSTRATE IN ITS  PATH   AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROOTS OF HOLLOW PALM TREES TUMBLED DOWN  
   THEN SEEST THOU ANY OF THEM LEFT SURVIVING  
   AND PHARAOH  AND THOSE BEFORE HIM  AND THE CITIES OVERTHROWN  COMMITTED HABITUAL SIN 
   AND DISOBEYED  EACH  THE APOSTLE OF THEIR LORD   SO HE PUNISHED THEM WITH AN ABUNDANT PENALTY 
   WE  WHEN THE WATER  OF NOAH S FLOOD  OVERFLOWED BEYOND ITS LIMITS  CARRIED YOU  MANKIND   IN THE FLOATING  ARK  
   THAT WE MIGHT MAKE IT A MESSAGE UNTO YOU  AND THAT EARS  THAT SHOULD HEAR THE TALE AND  RETAIN ITS MEMORY SHOULD BEAR ITS  LESSONS  IN REMEMBRANCE 
   THEN  WHEN ONE BLAST IS SOUNDED ON THE TRUMPET 
   AND THE EARTH IS MOVED  AND ITS MOUNTAINS  AND THEY ARE CRUSHED TO POWDER AT ONE STROKE  
   ON THAT DAY SHALL THE  GREAT  EVENT COME TO PASS 
   AND THE SKY WILL BE RENT ASUNDER  FOR IT WILL THAT DAY BE FLIMSY 
   AND THE ANGELS WILL BE ON ITS SIDES  AND EIGHT WILL  THAT DAY  BEAR THE THRONE OF THY LORD ABOVE THEM 
   THAT DAY SHALL YE BE BROUGHT TO JUDGMENT   NOT AN ACT OF YOURS THAT YE HIDE WILL BE HIDDEN 
   THEN HE THAT WILL BE GIVEN HIS RECORD IN HIS RIGHT HAND WILL SAY     AH HERE   READ YE MY RECORD
     I DID REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT MY ACCOUNT WOULD  ONE DAY  REACH ME    
   AND HE WILL BE IN A LIFE OF BLISS 
   IN A GARDEN ON HIGH 
   THE FRUITS WHEREOF  WILL HANG IN BUNCHES  LOW AND NEAR 
     EAT YE AND DRINK YE  WITH FULL SATISFACTION   BECAUSE OF THE  GOOD  THAT YE SENT BEFORE YOU  IN THE DAYS THAT ARE GONE    
   AND HE THAT WILL BE GIVEN HIS RECORD IN HIS LEFT HAND  WILL SAY     AH   WOULD THAT MY RECORD HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN TO ME  
     AND THAT I HAD NEVER REALISED HOW MY ACCOUNT  STOOD   
     AH   WOULD THAT  DEATH  HAD MADE AN END OF ME  
     OF NO PROFIT TO ME HAS BEEN MY WEALTH  
     MY POWER HAS PERISHED FROM ME     
    THE STERN COMMAND WILL SAY      SEIZE YE HIM  AND BIND YE HIM 
     AND BURN YE HIM IN THE BLAZING FIRE 
     FURTHER  MAKE HIM MARCH IN A CHAIN  WHEREOF THE LENGTH IS SEVENTY CUBITS  
     THIS WAS HE THAT WOULD NOT BELIEVE IN GOD MOST HIGH 
     AND WOULD NOT ENCOURAGE THE FEEDING OF THE INDIGENT  
     SO NO FRIEND HATH HE HERE THIS DAY 
     NOR HATH HE ANY FOOD EXCEPT THE CORRUPTION FROM THE WASHING OF WOUNDS 
     WHICH NONE DO EAT BUT THOSE IN SIN   SECTION  
   SO I DO CALL TO WITNESS WHAT YE SEE
   AND WHAT YE SEE NOT 
   THAT THIS IS VERILY THE WORD OF AN HONOURED APOSTLE  
   IT IS NOT THE WORD OF A POET   LITTLE IT IS YE BELIEVE  
   NOR IS IT THE WORD OF A SOOTHSAYER   LITTLE ADMONITION IT IS YE RECEIVE 
    THIS IS  A MESSAGE SENT DOWN FROM THE LORD OF THE WORLDS 
   AND IF THE APOSTLE WERE TO INVENT ANY SAYINGS IN OUR NAME 
   WE SHOULD CERTAINLY SEIZE HIM BY HIS RIGHT HAND 
   AND WE SHOULD CERTAINLY THEN CUT OFF THE ARTERY OF HIS HEART  
   NOR COULD ANY OF YOU WITHHOLD HIM  FROM OUR WRATH  
   BUT VERILY THIS IS A MESSAGE FOR THE GOD FEARING 
   AND WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THERE ARE AMONGST YOU THOSE THAT REJECT  IT  
   BUT TRULY  REVELATION  IS A CAUSE OF SORROW FOR THE UNBELIEVERS 
   BUT VERILY IT IS TRUTH OF ASSURED CERTAINTY 
   SO GLORIFY THE NAME OF THY LORD MOST HIGH 
   A QUESTIONER ASKED ABOUT A PENALTY TO BEFALL 
   THE UNBELIEVERS  THE WHICH THERE IS NONE TO WARD OFF  
    A PENALTY  FROM GOD  LORD OF THE WAYS OF ASCENT 
   THE ANGELS AND THE SPIRIT ASCEND UNTO HIM IN A DAY THE MEASURE WHEREOF IS  AS  FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS  
   THEREFORE DO THOU HOLD PATIENCE  A PATIENCE OF BEAUTIFUL  CONTENTMENT  
   THEY SEE THE  DAY  INDEED AS A FAR OFF  EVENT   
   BUT WE SEE IT  QUITE  NEAR 
   THE DAY THAT THE SKY WILL BE LIKE MOLTEN BRASS 
   AND THE MOUNTAINS WILL BE LIKE WOOL 
   AND NO FRIEND WILL ASK AFTER A FRIEND 
   THOUGH THEY WILL BE PUT IN SIGHT OF EACH OTHER   THE SINNER S DESIRE WILL BE   WOULD THAT HE COULD REDEEM HIMSELF FROM THE PENALTY OF THAT DAY BY  SACRIFICING  HIS CHILDREN 
   HIS WIFE AND HIS BROTHER 
   HIS KINDRED WHO SHELTERED HIM 
   AND ALL  ALL THAT IS ON EARTH  SO IT COULD DELIVER HIM  
   BY NO MEANS   FOR IT WOULD BE THE FIRE OF HELL   
   PLUCKING OUT  HIS BEING  RIGHT TO THE SKULL   
   INVITING  ALL  SUCH AS TURN THEIR BACKS AND TURN AWAY THEIR FACES  FROM THE RIGHT  
   AND COLLECT  WEALTH  AND HIDE IT  FROM USE   
   TRULY MAN WAS CREATED VERY IMPATIENT  
   FRETFUL WHEN EVIL TOUCHES HIM  
   AND NIGGARDLY WHEN GOOD REACHES HIM   
   NOT SO THOSE DEVOTED TO PRAYER   
   THOSE WHO REMAIN STEADFAST TO THEIR PRAYER  
   AND THOSE IN WHOSE WEALTH IS A RECOGNISED RIGHT
   FOR THE  NEEDY  WHO ASKS AND HIM WHO IS PREVENTED  FOR SOME REASON FROM ASKING   
   AND THOSE WHO HOLD TO THE TRUTH OF THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  
   AND THOSE WHO FEAR THE DISPLEASURE OF THEIR LORD  
   FOR THEIR LORD S DISPLEASURE IS THE OPPOSITE OF PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY   
   AND THOSE WHO GUARD THEIR CHASTITY
   EXCEPT WITH THEIR WIVES AND THE  CAPTIVES  WHOM THEIR RIGHT HANDS POSSESS   FOR  THEN  THEY ARE NOT TO BE BLAMED 
   BUT THOSE WHO TRESPASS BEYOND THIS ARE TRANSGRESSORS   
   AND THOSE WHO RESPECT THEIR TRUSTS AND COVENANTS  
   AND THOSE WHO STAND FIRM IN THEIR TESTIMONIES  
   AND THOSE WHO GUARD  THE SACREDNESS  OF THEIR WORSHIP   
   SUCH WILL BE THE HONOURED ONES IN THE GARDENS  OF BLISS  SECTION  
   NOW WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THE UNBELIEVERS THAT THEY RUSH MADLY BEFORE THEE 
   FROM THE RIGHT AND FROM THE LEFT IN CROWDS  
   DOES EVERY MAN OF THEM LONG TO ENTER THE GARDEN OF BLISS  
   BY NO MEANS   FOR WE HAVE CREATED THEM OUT OF THE  BASE MATTER  THEY KNOW  
   NOW I DO CALL TO WITNESS THE LORD OF ALL POINTS IN THE EAST AND THE WEST THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY 
   SUBSTITUTE FOR THEM BETTER  MEN  THAN THEY   AND WE ARE NOT TO BE DEFEATED  IN OUR PLAN  
   SO LEAVE THEM TO PLUNGE IN VAIN TALK AND PLAY ABOUT  UNTIL THEY ENCOUNTER THAT DAY OF THEIRS WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN PROMISED   
   THE DAY WHEREON THEY WILL ISSUE FROM THEIR SEPULCHRES IN SUDDEN HASTE AS IF THEY WERE RUSHING TO A GOAL POST  FIXED FOR THEM   
   THEIR EYES LOWERED IN DEJECTION   IGNOMINY COVERING THEM  ALL OVER    SUCH IS THE DAY THE WHICH THEY ARE PROMISED  
   WE SENT NOAH TO HIS PEOPLE  WITH THE COMMAND       DO THOU WARN THY PEOPLE BEFORE THERE COMES TO THEM A GRIEVOUS PENALTY   
   HE SAID     O MY PEOPLE  I AM TO YOU A WARNER  CLEAR AND OPEN  
     THAT YE SHOULD WORSHIP GOD  FEAR HIM  AND OBEY ME  
     SO HE MAY FORGIVE YOU YOUR SINS AND GIVE YOU RESPITE FOR A STATED TERM   FOR WHEN THE TERM GIVEN BY GOD IS ACCOMPLISHED  IT CANNOT BE PUT FORWARD   IF YE ONLY KNEW   
   HE SAID     O MY LORD   I HAVE CALLED TO MY PEOPLE NIGHT AND DAY  
     BUT MY CALL ONLY INCREASES  THEIR  FLIGHT  FROM THE RIGHT  
     AND EVERY TIME I HAVE CALLED TO THEM  THAT THOU MIGHTEST FORGIVE THEM  THEY HAVE  ONLY  THRUST THEIR FINGERS INTO THEIR EARS  COVERED THEMSELVES UP WITH THEIR GARMENTS  GROWN OBSTINATE AND GIVEN THEMSELVES UP TO ARROGANCE 
     SO I HAVE CALLED TO THEM ALOUD  
     FURTHER I HAVE SPOKEN TO THEM IN PUBLIC AND SECRETLY IN PRIVATE 
     SAYING   ASK FORGIVENESS FROM YOUR LORD   FOR HE IS OFT FORGIVING  
       HE WILL SEND RAIN TO YOU IN ABUNDANCE  
       GIVE YOU INCREASE IN WEALTH AND SONS   AND BESTOW ON YOU GARDENS AND BESTOW ON YOU RIVERS  OF FLOWING WATER  
       WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU  THAT YE PLACE NOT YOUR HOPE FOR KINDNESS AND LONG SUFFERING IN GOD  
       SEEING THAT IT IS HE THAT HAS CREATED YOU IN DIVERSE STAGES  
       SEE YE NOT HOW GOD HAS CREATED THE SEVEN HEAVENS ONE ABOVE ANOTHER 
       AND MADE THE MOON A LIGHT IN THEIR MIDST  AND MADE THE SUN AS A  GLORIOUS  LAMP  
       AND GOD HAS PRODUCED YOU FROM THE EARTH  GROWING  GRADUALLY  
       AND IN THE END HE WILL RETURN YOU INTO THE  EARTH  AND RAISE YOU FORTH  AGAIN AT THE RESURRECTION   
       AND GOD HAS MADE THE EARTH FOR YOU AS A CARPET  SPREAD OUT  
       THAT YE MAY GO ABOUT THEREIN  IN SPACIOUS ROADS     SECTION  
   NOAH SAID    O MY LORD   THEY HAVE DISOBEYED ME  BUT THEY FOLLOW  MEN  WHOSE WEALTH AND CHILDREN GIVE THEM NO INCREASE BUT ONLY LOSS 
     AND THEY HAVE DEVISED A TREMENDOUS PLOT 
     AND THEY HAVE SAID  TO EACH OTHER     ABANDON NOT YOUR GODS   ABANDON NEITHER WADD NOR SUWĀ   NEITHER YAGŪTH NOR YA ŪQ  NOR NASR     
     THEY HAVE ALREADY MISLED MANY   AND GRANT THOU NO INCREASE TO THE WRONG DOERS BUT IN STRAYING  FROM THEIR MARK    
   BECAUSE OF THEIR SINS THEY WERE DROWNED  IN THE FLOOD   AND WERE MADE TO ENTER THE FIRE  OF PUNISHMENT    AND THEY FOUND  IN LIEU OF GOD  NONE TO HELP THEM 
   AND NOAH SAID     O MY LORD   LEAVE NOT OF THE UNBELIEVERS  A SINGLE ONE ON EARTH  
     FOR  IF THOU DOST LEAVE  ANY OF  THEM  THEY WILL BUT MISLEAD THY DEVOTEES  AND THEY WILL BREED NONE BUT WICKED UNGRATEFUL ONES 
     O MY LORD   FORGIVE ME  MY PARENTS  ALL WHO ENTER MY HOUSE IN FAITH  AND  ALL  BELIEVING MEN AND BELIEVING WOMEN   AND TO THE WRONG DOERS GRANT THOU NO INCREASE BUT IN PERDITION    
   SAY   IT HAS BEEN REVEALED TO ME THAT A COMPANY OF JINNS LISTENED  TO THE QUR ĀN   THEY SAID    WE HAVE REALLY HEARD A WONDERFUL RECITAL  
     IT GIVES GUIDANCE TO THE RIGHT  AND WE HAVE BELIEVED THEREIN   WE SHALL NOT JOIN  IN WORSHIP  ANY  GODS  WITH OUR LORD 
     AND EXALTED IS THE MAJESTY OF OUR LORD   HE HAS TAKEN NEITHER A WIFE NOR A SON 
     THERE WERE SOME FOOLISH ONES AMONG US  WHO USED TO UTTER EXTRAVAGANT LIES AGAINST GOD  
     BUT WE DO THINK THAT NO MAN OR SPIRIT SHOULD SAY AUGHT THAT IS UNTRUE AGAINST GOD 
     TRUE  THERE WERE PERSONS AMONG MANKIND WHO TOOK SHELTER WITH PERSONS AMONG THE JINNS  BUT THEY INCREASED THEM IN FOLLY 
     AND THEY  CAME TO  THINK AS YE THOUGHT  THAT GOD WOULD NOT RAISE UP ANY ONE  TO JUDGMENT  
     AND WE PRIED INTO THE SECRETS OF HEAVEN   BUT WE FOUND IT FILLED WITH STERN GUARDS AND FLAMING FIRES 
     WE USED  INDEED  TO SIT THERE IN  HIDDEN  STATIONS  TO  STEAL  A HEARING   BUT ANY WHO LISTENS NOW WILL FIND A FLAMING FIRE WATCHING HIM IN AMBUSH 
     AND WE UNDERSTAND NOT WHETHER ILL IS INTENDED TO THOSE ON EARTH  OR WHETHER THEIR LORD  REALLY  INTENDS TO GUIDE THEM TO RIGHT CONDUCT 
     THERE ARE AMONG US SOME THAT ARE RIGHTEOUS  AND SOME THE CONTRARY   WE FOLLOW DIVERGENT PATHS 
     BUT WE THINK THAT WE CAN BY NO MEANS FRUSTRATE GOD THROUGHOUT THE EARTH  NOR CAN WE FRUSTRATE HIM BY FLIGHT 
     AND AS FOR US  SINCE WE HAVE LISTENED TO THE GUIDANCE  WE HAVE ACCEPTED IT   AND ANY WHO BELIEVES IN HIS LORD HAS NO FEAR  EITHER OF A SHORT  ACCOUNT  OR OF ANY INJUSTICE 
     AMONGST US ARE SOME THAT SUBMIT THEIR WILLS  TO GOD   AND SOME THAT SWERVE FROM JUSTICE  NOW THOSE WHO SUBMIT THEIR WILLS THEY HAVE SOUGHT OUT  THE PATH  OF RIGHT CONDUCT  
     BUT THOSE WHO SWERVE   THEY ARE  BUT  FUEL FOR HELL FIRE    
    AND GOD S MESSAGE IS      IF THEY  THE PAGANS  HAD  ONLY  REMAINED ON THE  RIGHT  WAY  WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BESTOWED ON THEM RAIN IN ABUNDANCE 
     THAT WE MIGHT TRY THEM BY THAT  MEANS   BUT IF ANY TURNS AWAY FROM THE REMEMBRANCE OF HIS LORD  HE WILL CAUSE HIM TO UNDERGO A SEVERE PENALTY 
     AND THE PLACES OF WORSHIP ARE FOR GOD  ALONE    SO INVOKE NOT ANY ONE ALONG WITH GOD  
     YET WHEN THE DEVOTEE OF GOD STANDS FORTH TO INVOKE HIM  THEY JUST MAKE ROUND HIM A DENSE CROWD   SECTION  
   SAY     I DO NO MORE THAN INVOKE MY LORD  AND I JOIN NOT WITH HIM ANY  FALSE GOD    
   SAY     IT IS NOT IN MY POWER TO CAUSE YOU HARM  OR TO BRING YOU TO RIGHT CONDUCT   
   SAY     NO ONE CAN DELIVER ME FROM GOD  IF I WERE TO DISOBEY HIM   NOR SHOULD I FIND REFUGE EXCEPT IN HIM 
     UNLESS I PROCLAIM WHAT I RECEIVE FROM GOD AND HIS MESSAGES   FOR ANY THAT DISOBEY GOD AND HIS APOSTLE  FOR THEM IS HELL   THEY SHALL DWELL THEREIN FOR EVER   
   AT LENGTH  WHEN THEY SEE  WITH THEIR OWN EYES  THAT WHICH THEY ARE PROMISED   THEN WILL THEY KNOW WHO IT IS THAT IS WEAKEST IN  HIS  HELPER AND LEAST IMPORTANT IN POINT OF NUMBERS 
   SAY     I KNOW NOT WHETHER THE  PUNISHMENT  WHICH YE ARE PROMISED IS NEAR  OR WHETHER MY LORD WILL APPOINT FOR IT A DISTANT TERM 
     HE  ALONE  KNOWS THE UNSEEN  NOR DOES HE MAKE ANY ONE ACQUAINTED WITH HIS MYSTERIES  
     EXCEPT AN APOSTLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN   AND THEN HE MAKES A BAND OF WATCHERS MARCH BEFORE HIM AND BEHIND HIM 
     THAT HE MAY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE  TRULY  BROUGHT AND DELIVERED THE MESSAGES OF THEIR LORD   AND HE SURROUNDS  ALL THE MYSTERIES  THAT ARE WITH THEM  AND TAKES ACCOUNT OF EVERY SINGLE THING   
   O THOU FOLDED IN GARMENTS  
   STAND  TO PRAYER  BY NIGHT  BUT NOT ALL NIGHT  
   HALF OF IT   OR A LITTLE LESS 
   OR A LITTLE MORE   AND RECITE THE QUR ĀN IN SLOW  MEASURED RHYTHMIC TONES 
   SOON SHALL WE SEND DOWN TO THEE A WEIGHTY MESSAGE 
   TRULY THE RISING BY NIGHT IS MOST POTENT FOR GOVERNING  THE SOUL   AND MOST SUITABLE FOR  FRAMING  THE WORD  OF PRAYER AND PRAISE  
   TRUE  THERE IS FOR THEE BY DAY PROLONGED OCCUPATION WITH ORDINARY DUTIES  
   BUT KEEP IN REMEMBRANCE THE NAME OF THY LORD AND DEVOTE THYSELF TO HIM WHOLE HEARTEDLY 
    HE IS  LORD OF THE EAST AND THE WEST   THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE   TAKE HIM THEREFORE FOR  THY  DISPOSER OF AFFAIRS 
   AND HAVE PATIENCE WITH WHAT THEY SAY  AND LEAVE THEM WITH NOBLE  DIGNITY  
   AND LEAVE ME  ALONE TO DEAL WITH  THOSE IN POSSESSION OF THE GOOD THINGS OF LIFE  WHO  YET  DENY THE TRUTH   AND BEAR WITH THEM FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
   WITH US ARE FETTERS  TO BIND THEM   AND A FIRE  TO BURN THEM  
   AND A FOOD THAT CHOKES  AND A PENALTY GRIEVOUS 
   ONE DAY THE EARTH AND THE MOUNTAINS WILL BE IN VIOLENT COMMOTION  AND THE MOUNTAINS WILL BE AS A HEAP OF SAND POURED OUT AND FLOWING DOWN 
   WE HAVE SENT TO YOU   O MEN    AN APOSTLE  TO BE A WITNESS CONCERNING YOU  EVEN AS WE SENT AN APOSTLE TO PHARAOH 
   BUT PHARAOH DISOBEYED THE APOSTLE   SO WE SEIZED HIM WITH A HEAVY PUNISHMENT 
   THEN HOW SHALL YE  IF YE DENY  GOD   GUARD YOURSELVES AGAINST A DAY THAT WILL MAKE CHILDREN HOARY HEADED   
   WHEREON THE SKY WILL BE CLEFT ASUNDER   HIS PROMISE NEEDS MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED 
   VERILY THIS IS AN ADMONITION   THEREFORE  WHOSO WILL  LET HIM TAKE A  STRAIGHT  PATH TO HIS LORD  SECTION  
   THY LORD DOTH KNOW THAT THOU STANDEST FORTH  TO PRAYER  NIGH TWO THIRDS OF THE NIGHT  OR HALF THE NIGHT  OR A THIRD OF THE NIGHT  AND SO DOTH A PARTY OF THOSE WITH THEE  BUT GOD DOTH APPOINT NIGHT AND DAY IN DUE MEASURE  HE KNOWETH THAT YE ARE UNABLE TO KEEP COUNT THEREOF  SO HE HATH TURNED TO YOU  IN MERCY    READ YE  THEREFORE  OF THE QUR ĀN AS MUCH AS MAY BE EASY FOR YOU  HE KNOWETH THAT THERE MAY BE  SOME  AMONG YOU IN ILL HEALTH   OTHERS TRAVELING THROUGH THE LAND  SEEKING OF GOD S BOUNTY   YET OTHERS FIGHTING IN GOD S CAUSE  READ YE  THEREFORE  AS MUCH OF THE QUR AN AS MAY BE EASY  FOR YOU    AND ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER AND GIVE REGULAR CHARITY   AND LOAN TO GOD A BEAUTIFUL LOAN  AND WHATEVER GOOD YE SEND FORTH FOR YOUR SOULS  YE SHALL FIND IT IN GOD S PRESENCE   YEA  BETTER AND GREATER  IN REWARD  AND SEEK YE THE GRACE OF GOD   FOR GOD IS OFT FORGIVING  MOST MERCIFUL 
   O THOU WRAPPED UP  IN A MANTLE   
   ARISE AND DELIVER THY WARNING  
   AND THY LORD DO THOU MAGNIFY  
   AND THY GARMENTS KEEP FREE FROM STAIN  
   AND ALL ABOMINATION SHUN  
   NOR EXPECT  IN GIVING  ANY INCREASE  FOR THYSELF   
   BUT  FOR THY LORD S  CAUSE   BE PATIENT AND CONSTANT  
   FINALLY  WHEN THE TRUMPET IS SOUNDED 
   THAT WILL BE THAT DAY  A DAY OF DISTRESS  
   FAR FROM EASY FOR THOSE WITHOUT FAITH 
   LEAVE ME ALONE   TO DEAL  WITH THE  CREATURE  WHOM I CREATED  BARE AND  ALONE   
   TO WHOM I GRANTED RESOURCES IN ABUNDANCE 
   AND SONS TO BE BY HIS SIDE   
   TO WHOM I MADE  LIFE  SMOOTH AND COMFORTABLE  
   YET IS HE GREEDY  THAT I SHOULD ADD  YET MORE   
   BY NO MEANS   FOR TO OUR SIGNS HE HAS BEEN REFRACTORY  
   SOON WILL I VISIT HIM WITH A MOUNT OF CALAMITIES  
   FOR HE THOUGHT AND HE PLOTTED   
   AND WOE TO HIM   HOW HE PLOTTED   
   YEA  WOE TO HIM   HOW HE PLOTTED   
   THEN HE LOOKED ROUND  
   THEN HE FROWNED AND HE SCOWLED  
   THEN HE TURNED BACK AND WAS HAUGHTY  
   THEN SAID HE     THIS IS NOTHING BUT MAGIC  DERIVED FROM OF OLD    
     THIS IS NOTHING BUT THE WORD OF A MORTAL    
   SOON WILL I CAST HIM INTO HELL FIRE  
   AND WHAT WILL EXPLAIN TO THEE WHAT HELL FIRE IS  
   NAUGHT DOTH IT PERMIT TO ENDURE  AND NAUGHT DOTH IT LEAVE ALONE   
   DARKENING AND CHANGING THE COLOUR OF MAN  
   OVER IT ARE NINETEEN 
   AND WE HAVE SET NONE BUT ANGELS AS GUARDIANS OF THE FIRE   AND WE HAVE FIXED THEIR NUMBER ONLY AS A TRIAL FOR UNBELIEVERS  IN ORDER THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK MAY ARRIVE AT CERTAINTY  AND THE BELIEVERS MAY INCREASE IN FAITH   AND THAT NO DOUBTS MAY BE LEFT FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK AND THE BELIEVERS  AND THAT THOSE IN WHOSE HEARTS IS A DISEASE AND THE UNBELIEVERS MAY SAY    WHAT SYMBOL DOTH GOD INTEND BY THIS     THUS DOTH GOD LEAVE TO STRAY WHOM HE PLEASETH AND GUIDE WHOM HE PLEASETH   AND NONE CAN KNOW THE FORCES OF THE LORD  EXCEPT HE  AND THIS IS NO OTHER THAN A WARNING TO MANKIND SECTION  
   NAY  VERILY   BY THE MOON 
   AND BY THE NIGHT AS IT RETREATETH 
   AND BY THE DAWN AS IT SHINETH FORTH  
   THIS IS BUT ONE OF THE MIGHTY  PORTENTS  
   A WARNING TO MANKIND  
   TO ANY OF YOU THAT CHOOSES TO PRESS FORWARD  OR TO FOLLOW BEHIND   
   EVERY SOUL WILL BE  HELD  IN PLEDGE FOR ITS DEEDS 
   EXCEPT THE COMPANIONS OF THE RIGHT HAND 
    THEY WILL BE  IN GARDENS  OF DELIGHT    THEY WILL QUESTION EACH OTHER 
   AND  ASK  OF THE SINNERS  
     WHAT LED YOU INTO HELL FIRE    
   THEY WILL SAY    WE WERE NOT OF THOSE WHO PRAYED    
     NOR WERE WE OF THOSE WHO FED THE INDIGENT    
     BUT WE USED TO TALK VANITIES WITH VAIN TALKERS    
     AND WE USED TO DENY THE DAY OF JUDGMENT   
     UNTIL THERE CAME TO US  THE HOUR  THAT IS CERTAIN   
   THEN WILL NO INTERCESSION OF  ANY  INTERCESSORS PROFIT THEM 
   THEN WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THEM THAT THEY TURN AWAY FROM ADMONITION   
   AS IF THEY WERE AFFRIGHTED ASSES 
   FLEEING FROM A LION  
   FORSOOTH  EACH ONE OF THEM WANTS TO BE GIVEN SCROLLS  OF REVELATION  SPREAD OUT  
   BY NO MEANS  BUT THEY FEAR NOT THE HEREAFTER 
   NAY  THIS SURELY IS AN ADMONITION  
   LET ANY WHO WILL  KEEP IT IN REMEMBRANCE  
   BUT NONE WILL KEEP IT IN REMEMBRANCE EXCEPT AS GOD WILLS   HE IS THE LORD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  AND THE LORD OF FORGIVENESS 
   I DO CALL TO WITNESS THE RESURRECTION DAY  
   AND I DO CALL TO WITNESS THE SELF REPROACHING SPIRIT    ESCHEW EVIL  
   DOES MAN THINK THAT WE CANNOT ASSEMBLE HIS BONES  
   NAY  WE ARE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER IN PERFECT ORDER THE VERY TIPS OF HIS FINGERS 
   BUT MAN WISHES TO DO WRONG  EVEN  IN THE TIME IN FRONT OF HIM 
   HE QUESTIONS    WHEN IS THE DAY OF RESURRECTION    
   AT LENGTH  WHEN THE SIGHT IS DAZED 
   AND THE MOON IS BURIED IN DARKNESS 
   AND THE SUN AND MOON ARE JOINED TOGETHER  
   THAT DAY WILL MAN SAY     WHERE IS THE REFUGE    
   BY NO MEANS   NO PLACE OF SAFETY  
   BEFORE THY LORD  ALONE   THAT DAY WILL BE THE PLACE OF REST 
   THAT DAY WILL MAN BE TOLD  ALL  THAT HE PUT FORWARD  AND ALL THAT HE PUT BACK 
   NAY  MAN WILL BE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIMSELF 
   EVEN THOUGH HE WERE TO PUT UP HIS EXCUSES 
   MOVE NOT THY TONGUE CONCERNING THE  QUR ĀN  TO MAKE HASTE THEREWITH 
   IT IS FOR US TO COLLECT IT AND TO PROMULGATE IT  
   BUT WHEN WE HAVE PROMULGATED IT  FOLLOW THOU ITS RECITAL  AS PROMULGATED   
   NAY MORE  IT IS FOR US TO EXPLAIN IT  AND MAKE IT CLEAR   
   NAY   YE MEN    BUT YE LOVE THE FLEETING LIFE 
   AND LEAVE ALONE THE HEREAFTER 
   SOME FACES  THAT DAY  WILL BEAM  IN BRIGHTNESS AND BEAUTY   
   LOOKING TOWARDS THEIR LORD  
   AND SOME FACES THAT DAY  WILL BE SAD AND DISMAL 
   IN THE THOUGHT THAT SOME BACK BREAKING CALAMITY WAS ABOUT TO BE INFLICTED ON THEM  
   YEA  WHEN  THE SOUL  REACHES TO THE COLLAR BONE  IN ITS EXIT  
   AND THERE WILL BE A CRY    WHO IS A MAGICIAN  TO RESTORE HIM     
   AND HE WILL CONCLUDE THAT IT WAS  THE TIME  OF PARTING  
   AND ONE LEG WILL BE JOINED WITH ANOTHER  
   THAT DAY THE DRIVE WILL BE  ALL  TO THY LORD  SECTION  
   SO HE GAVE NOTHING IN CHARITY  NOR DID HE PRAY   
   BUT ON THE CONTRARY  HE REJECTED TRUTH AND TURNED AWAY  
   THEN DID HE STALK TO HIS FAMILY IN FULL CONCEIT  
   WOE TO THEE   O MAN    YEA  WOE  
   AGAIN  WOE TO THEE   O MAN     YEA  WOE  
   DOES MAN THINK THAT HE WILL BE LEFT UNCONTROLLED   WITHOUT PURPOSE  
   WAS HE NOT A DROP OF SPERM EMITTED  IN LOWLY FORM   
   THEN DID HE BECOME A LEECH LIKE CLOT   THEN DID  GOD  MAKE AND FASHION  HIM  IN DUE PROPORTION 
   AND OF HIM HE MADE TWO SEXES  MALE AND FEMALE 
   HAS NOT HE   THE SAME   THE POWER TO GIVE LIFE TO THE DEAD  
   HAS THERE NOT BEEN OVER MAN A LONG PERIOD OF TIME  WHEN HE WAS NOTHING  NOT EVEN  MENTIONED  
   VERILY WE CREATED MAN FROM A DROP OF MINGLED SPERM  IN ORDER TO TRY HIM   SO WE GAVE HIM  THE GIFTS   OF HEARING AND SIGHT 
   WE SHOWED HIM THE WAY   WHETHER HE BE GRATEFUL OR UNGRATEFUL  RESTS ON HIS WILL  
   FOR THE REJECTERS WE HAVE PREPARED CHAINS  YOKES AND A BLAZING FIRE 
   AS TO THE RIGHTEOUS  THEY SHALL DRINK OF A CUP  OF WINE  MIXED WITH KAFUR  
   A FOUNTAIN WHERE THE DEVOTEES OF GOD DO DRINK  MAKING IT FLOW IN UNSTINTED ABUNDANCE 
   THEY PERFORM  THEIR  VOWS  AND THEY FEAR A DAY WHOSE EVIL FLIES FAR AND WIDE 
   AND THEY FEED  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD  THE INDIGENT  THE ORPHAN  AND THE CAPTIVE  
    SAYING     WE FEED YOU FOR THE SAKE OF GOD ALONE   NO REWARD DO WE DESIRE FROM YOU NOR THANKS 
     WE ONLY FEAR A DAY OF DISTRESSFUL WRATH FROM THE SIDE OF OUR LORD   
   BUT GOD WILL DELIVER THEM FROM THE EVIL OF THAT DAY  AND WILL SHED OVER THEM A LIGHT OF BEAUTY AND A  BLISSFUL  JOY 
   AND BECAUSE THEY WERE PATIENT AND CONSTANT  HE WILL REWARD THEM WITH A GARDEN AND  GARMENTS OF  SILK 
   RECLINING IN THE  GARDEN  ON RAISED THRONES  THEY WILL SEE THERE NEITHER THE SUN S  EXCESSIVE HEAT  NOR  THE MOON S  EXCESSIVE COLD 
   AND THE SHADES OF THE  GARDEN  WILL COME LOW OVER THEM  AND THE BUNCHES  OF FRUIT   THERE  WILL HANG LOW IN HUMILITY 
   AND AMONGST THEM WILL BE PASSED ROUND VESSELS OF SILVER AND GOBLETS OF CRYSTAL  
   CRYSTAL CLEAR  MADE OF SILVER   THEY WILL DETERMINE THE MEASURE THEREOF  ACCORDING TO THEIR WISHES  
   AND THEY WILL BE GIVEN TO DRINK THERE OF A CUP  OF WINE  MIXED WITH ZANJABIL  
   A FOUNTAIN THERE  CALLED SALSABIL 
   AND ROUND ABOUT THEM WILL  SERVE  YOUTHS OF PERPETUAL  FRESHNESS    IF THOU SEEST THEM  THOU WOULDST THINK THEM SCATTERED PEARLS 
   AND WHEN THOU LOOKEST  IT IS THERE THOU WILT SEE A BLISS AND A REALM MAGNIFICENT 
   UPON THEM WILL BE GREEN GARMENTS OF FINE SILK AND HEAVY BROCADE  AND THEY WILL BE ADORNED WITH BRACELETS OF SILVER   AND THEIR LORD WILL GIVE TO THEM TO DRINK OF A WINE PURE AND HOLY 
     VERILY THIS IS A REWARD FOR YOU  AND YOUR ENDEAVOUR IS ACCEPTED AND RECOGNISED   SECTION  
   IT IS WE WHO HAVE SENT DOWN THE QUR ĀN TO THEE BY STAGES 
   THEREFORE BE PATIENT WITH CONSTANCY TO THE COMMAND OF THY LORD  AND HEARKEN NOT TO THE SINNER OR THE INGRATE AMONG THEM 
   AND CELEBRATE THE NAME OF THY LORD MORNING AND EVENING 
   AND PART OF THE NIGHT  PROSTRATE THYSELF TO HIM   AND GLORIFY HIM   A LONG NIGHT THROUGH 
   AS TO THESE  THEY LOVE THE FLEETING LIFE  AND PUT AWAY BEHIND THEM A DAY  THAT WILL BE  HARD 
   IT IS WE WHO CREATED THEM  AND WE HAVE MADE THEIR JOINTS STRONG   BUT  WHEN WE WILL  WE CAN SUBSTITUTE THE LIKE OF THEM BY A COMPLETE CHANGE 
   THIS IS AN ADMONITION   WHOSOEVER WILL  LET HIM TAKE A  STRAIGHT  PATH TO HIS LORD 
   BUT YE WILL NOT  EXCEPT AS GOD WILLS   FOR GOD IS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM 
   HE WILL ADMIT TO HIS MERCY WHOM HE WILL   BUT THE WRONG DOERS   FOR THEM HAS HE PREPARED A GRIEVOUS PENALTY 
   BY THE  WINDS  SENT FORTH ONE AFTER ANOTHER  TO MAN S PROFIT   
   WHICH THEN BLOW VIOLENTLY IN TEMPESTUOUS GUSTS 
   AND SCATTER  THINGS  FAR AND WIDE  
   THEN SEPARATE THEM  ONE FROM ANOTHER 
   THEN SPREAD ABROAD A MESSAGE 
   WHETHER OF JUSTIFICATION OR OF WARNING   
   ASSUREDLY  WHAT YE ARE PROMISED MUST COME TO PASS 
   THEN WHEN THE STARS BECOME DIM  
   WHEN THE HEAVEN IS CLEFT ASUNDER  
   WHEN THE MOUNTAINS ARE SCATTERED  TO THE WINDS  AS DUST  
   AND WHEN THE APOSTLES ARE  ALL  APPOINTED A TIME  TO COLLECT    
   FOR WHAT DAY ARE THESE  PORTENTS  DEFERRED  
   FOR THE DAY OF SORTING OUT 
   AND WHAT WILL EXPLAIN TO THEE WHAT IS THE DAY OF SORTING OUT  
   AH WOE  THAT DAY  TO THE REJECTERS OF TRUTH  
   DID WE NOT DESTROY THE MEN OF OLD  FOR THEIR EVIL   
   SO SHALL WE MAKE LATER  GENERATIONS  FOLLOW THEM 
   THUS DO WE DEAL WITH MEN OF SIN 
   AH WOE  THAT DAY  TO THE REJECTERS OF TRUTH  
   HAVE WE NOT CREATED YOU FROM A FLUID  HELD  DESPICABLE   
   THE WHICH WE PLACED IN A PLACE OF REST  FIRMLY FIXED 
   FOR A PERIOD  OF GESTATION  DETERMINED  ACCORDING TO NEED  
   FOR WE DO DETERMINE  ACCORDING TO NEED    FOR WE ARE THE BEST TO DETERMINE  THINGS  
   AH WOE  THAT DAY   TO THE REJECTERS OF TRUTH  
   HAVE WE NOT MADE THE EARTH  AS A PLACE  TO DRAW TOGETHER
   THE LIVING AND THE DEAD 
   AND MADE THEREIN MOUNTAINS STANDING FIRM  LOFTY  IN STATURE    AND PROVIDED FOR YOU WATER SWEET  AND WHOLESOME   
   AH WOE  THAT DAY  TO THE REJECTERS OF TRUTH  
    IT WILL BE SAID &COLON     DEPART YE TO THAT WHICH YE USED TO REJECT AS FALSE  
     DEPART YE TO A SHADOW  OF SMOKE ASCENDING  IN THREE COLUMNS 
      WHICH YIELDS  NO SHADE OF COOLNESS  AND IS OF NO USE AGAINST THE FIERCE BLAZE 
     INDEED IT THROWS ABOUT SPARKS  HUGE  AS FORTS 
     AS IF THERE WERE  A STRING OF  YELLOW CAMELS  MARCHING SWIFTLY    
   AH WOE  THAT DAY  TO THE REJECTERS OF TRUTH  
   THAT WILL BE A DAY WHEN THEY SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK 
   NOR WILL IT BE OPEN TO THEM TO PUT FORTH PLEAS 
   AH WOE  THAT DAY  TO THE REJECTERS OF TRUTH  
   THAT WILL BE A DAY OF SORTING OUT   WE SHALL GATHER YOU TOGETHER AND THOSE BEFORE  YOU   
   NOW  IF YE HAVE A TRICK  OR PLOT   USE IT AGAINST ME  
   AH WOE  THAT DAY  TO THE REJECTERS OF TRUTH  SECTION  
   AS TO THE RIGHTEOUS  THEY SHALL BE AMIDST  COOL  SHADES AND SPRINGS  OF WATER  
   AND  THEY SHALL HAVE  FRUITS   ALL THEY DESIRE 
     EAT YE AND DRINK YE TO YOUR HEART S CONTENT   FOR THAT YE WORKED  RIGHTEOUSNESS    
   THUS DO WE CERTAINLY REWARD THE DOERS OF GOOD 
   AH WOE  THAT DAY  TO THE REJECTERS OF TRUTH  
    O YE UNJUST    EAT YE AND ENJOY YOURSELVES  BUT  A LITTLE WHILE  FOR THAT YE ARE SINNERS 
   AH WOE  THAT DAY  TO THE REJECTERS OF TRUTH  
   AND WHEN IT IS SAID TO THEM    PROSTRATE YOURSELVES     THEY DO NOT SO 
   AH WOE  THAT DAY  TO THE REJECTERS OF TRUTH  
   THEN WHAT MESSAGE  AFTER THAT  WILL THEY BELIEVE IN  
   CONCERNING WHAT ARE THEY DISPUTING  
   CONCERNING THE GREAT NEWS 
   ABOUT WHICH THEY CANNOT AGREE 
   VERILY  THEY SHALL SOON  COME TO  KNOW  
   VERILY  VERILY THEY SHALL SOON  COME TO  KNOW  
   HAVE WE NOT MADE THE EARTH AS A WIDE EXPANSE 
   AND THE MOUNTAINS AS PEGS  
   AND  HAVE WE NOT  CREATED YOU IN PAIRS 
   AND MADE YOUR SLEEP FOR REST 
   AND MADE THE NIGHT AS A COVERING 
   AND MADE THE DAY AS A MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE  
   AND  HAVE WE NOT  BUILT OVER YOU THE SEVEN FIRMAMENTS 
   AND PLACED  THEREIN  A LIGHT OF SPLENDOUR  
   AND DO WE NOT SEND DOWN FROM THE CLOUDS WATER IN ABUNDANCE 
   THAT WE MAY PRODUCE THEREWITH CORN AND VEGETABLES 
   AND GARDENS OF LUXURIOUS GROWTH  
   VERILY THE DAY OF SORTING OUT IS A THING APPOINTED  
   THE DAY THAT THE TRUMPET SHALL BE SOUNDED  AND YE SHALL COME FORTH IN CROWDS  
   AND THE HEAVENS SHALL BE OPENED AS IF THERE WERE DOORS 
   AND THE MOUNTAINS SHALL VANISH  AS IF THEY WERE A MIRAGE 
   TRULY HELL IS AS A PLACE OF AMBUSH  
   FOR THE TRANSGRESSORS A PLACE OF DESTINATION  
   THEY WILL DWELL THEREIN FOR AGES 
   NOTHING COOL SHALL THEY TASTES THEREIN NOR ANY DRINK 
   SAVE A BOILING FLUID AND A FLUID  DARK MURKY  INTENSELY COLD  
   A FITTING RECOMPENSE  FOR THEM  
   FOR THAT THEY USED NOT TO FEAR ANY ACCOUNT  FOR THEIR DEEDS  
   BUT THEY  IMPUDENTLY  TREATED OUR SIGNS AS FALSE 
   AND ALL THINGS HAVE WE PRESERVED ON RECORD 
     SO TASTE YE  THE FRUITS OF YOUR DEEDS   FOR NO INCREASE SHALL WE GRANT YOU  EXCEPT IN PUNISHMENT   SECTION  
   VERILY FOR THE RIGHTEOUS THERE WILL BE A FULFILMENT OF  THE HEART S  DESIRES  
   GARDENS ENCLOSED  AND GRAPEVINES  
   COMPANIONS OF EQUAL AGE  
   AND A CUP FULL  TO THE BRIM  
   NO VANITY SHALL THEY HEAR THEREIN  NOR UNTRUTH  
   RECOMPENSE FROM THY LORD  A GIFT   AMPLY  SUFFICIENT  
    FROM  THE LORD OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH  AND ALL BETWEEN    GOD  MOST GRACIOUS   NONE SHALL HAVE POWER TO ARGUE WITH HIM 
   THE DAY THAT THE SPIRIT AND THE ANGELS WILL STAND FORTH IN RANKS  NONE SHALL SPEAK EXCEPT ANY WHO IS PERMITTED BY  GOD  MOST GRACIOUS  AND HE WILL SAY WHAT IS RIGHT 
   THAT DAY WILL BE THE SURE REALITY   THEREFORE  WHOSO WILL  LET HIM TAKE A  STRAIGHT  RETURN TO HIS LORD  
   VERILY  WE HAVE WARNED YOU OF A PENALTY NEAR   THE DAY WHEN MAN WILL SEE  THE DEEDS  WHICH HIS HANDS HAVE SENT FORTH  AND THE UNBELIEVER WILL SAY    WOE UNTO ME   WOULD THAT I WERE  MERE  DUST    
   BY THE  ANGELS  WHO TEAR OUT  THE SOULS OF THE WICKED  WITH VIOLENCE  
   BY THOSE WHO GENTLY DRAW OUT  THE SOULS OF THE BLESSED   
   AND BY THOSE WHO GLIDE ALONG  ON ERRANDS OF MERCY  
   THEN PRESS FORWARD AS IN A RACE 
   THEN ARRANGE TO DO  THE COMMANDS OF THEIR LORD   
   ONE DAY EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE IN COMMOTION WILL BE IN VIOLENT COMMOTION 
   FOLLOWED BY OFT REPEATED  COMMOTIONS   
   HEARTS THAT DAY WILL BE IN AGITATION  
   CAST DOWN WILL BE  THEIR OWNERS   EYES 
   THEY SAY  NOW      WHAT   SHALL WE INDEED BE RETURNED TO  OUR  FORMER STATE   
     WHAT    WHEN WE SHALL HAVE BECOME ROTTEN BONES    
   THEY SAY     IT WOULD  IN THAT CASE  BE A RETURN WITH LOSS    
   BUT VERILY  IT WILL BE BUT A SINGLE  COMPELLING  CRY 
   WHEN  BEHOLD  THEY WILL BE IN THE  FULL  AWAKENING  TO JUDGMENT  
   HAS THE STORY OF MOSES REACHED THEE  
   BEHOLD  THY LORD DID CALL TO HIM IN THE SACRED VALLEY OF TUWĀ   
     GO THOU TO PHARAOH  FOR HE HAS INDEED TRANSGRESSED ALL BOUNDS  
     AND SAY TO HIM    WOULDST THOU THAT THOU SHOULDST BE PURIFIED  FROM SIN    
      AND THAT I GUIDE THEE TO THY LORD  SO THOU SHOULDST FEAR HIM    
   THEN DID  MOSES  SHOW HIM THE GREAT SIGN 
   BUT  PHARAOH  REJECTED IT AND DISOBEYED  GUIDANCE  
   FURTHER HE TURNED HIS BACK STRIVING HARD  AGAINST GOD  
   THEN HE COLLECTED  HIS MEN  AND MADE A PROCLAMATION 
   SAYING    I AM YOUR LORD  MOST HIGH   
   BUT GOD DID PUNISH HIM   AND MADE AN  EXAMPLE OF HIM  IN THE HEREAFTER  AS IN THIS LIFE 
   VERILY IN THIS IS AN INSTRUCTIVE WARNING FOR WHOSOEVER FEARETH  GOD  SECTION  
   WHAT   ARE YE THE MORE DIFFICULT TO CREATE OR THE HEAVEN  ABOVE    GOD  HATH CONSTRUCTED IT  
   ON HIGH HATH HE RAISED ITS CANOPY  AND HE HATH GIVEN IT ORDER AND PERFECTION 
   ITS NIGHT DOTH HE ENDOW WITH DARKNESS  AND ITS SPLENDOUR DOTH HE BRING OUT  WITH LIGHT  
   AND THE EARTH  MOREOVER  HATH HE EXTENDED  TO A WIDE EXPANSE  
   HE DRAWETH OUT THEREFROM ITS MOISTURE AND ITS PASTURE  
   AND THE MOUNTAINS HATH HE FIRMLY FIXED  
   FOR USE AND CONVENIENCE TO YOU AND YOUR CATTLE 
   THEREFORE  WHEN THERE COMES THE GREAT  OVERWHELMING  EVENT   
   THE DAY WHEN MAN SHALL REMEMBER  ALL  THAT HE STROVE FOR 
   AND HELL FIRE SHALL BE PLACED IN FULL VIEW FOR  ALL  TO SEE  
   THEN  FOR SUCH AS HAD TRANSGRESSED ALL BOUNDS 
   AND HAD PREFERRED THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD 
   THE ABODE WILL BE HELL FIRE  
   AND FOR SUCH AS HAD ENTERTAINED THE FEAR OF STANDING BEFORE THEIR LORD S  TRIBUNAL  AND HAD RESTRAINED  THEIR  SOUL FROM LOWER DESIRES 
   THEIR ABODE WILL BE THE GARDEN 
   THEY ASK THEE ABOUT THE HOUR   WHEN WILL BE ITS APPOINTED TIME   
   WHEREIN ART THOU  CONCERNED  WITH THE DECLARATION THEREOF  
   WITH THY LORD IS THE LIMIT FIXED THEREFOR 
   THOU ART BUT A WARNER FOR SUCH AS FEAR IT 
   THE DAY THEY SEE IT   IT WILL BE  AS IF THEY HAD TARRIED BUT A SINGLE EVENING  OR  AT MOST TILL  THE FOLLOWING MORN  
    THE PROPHET  FROWNED AND TURNED AWAY 
   BECAUSE THERE CAME TO HIM THE BLIND MAN  INTERRUPTING  
   BUT WHAT COULD TELL THEE BUT THAT PERCHANCE HE MIGHT GROW  IN SPIRITUAL UNDERSTANDING    
   OR THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE ADMONITION  AND THE TEACHING MIGHT PROFIT HIM  
   AS TO ONE WHO REGARDS HIMSELF AS SELF SUFFICIENT 
   TO HIM DOST THOU ATTEND  
   THOUGH IT IS NO BLAME TO THEE IF HE GROW NOT  IN SPIRITUAL UNDERSTANDING  
   BUT AS TO HIM WHO CAME TO THEE STRIVING EARNESTLY 
   AND WITH FEAR  IN HIS HEART  
   OF HIM WAST THOU UNMINDFUL 
   BY NO MEANS  SHOULD IT BE SO    FOR IT IS INDEED A MESSAGE OF INSTRUCTION  
   THEREFORE LET WHOSO WILL  KEEP IT IN REMEMBRANCE 
    IT IS  IN BOOKS HELD  GREATLY  IN HONOUR 
   EXALTED  IN DIGNITY   KEPT PURE AND HOLY 
    WRITTEN  BY THE HANDS OF SCRIBES  
   HONORABLE AND PIOUS AND JUST 
   WOE TO MAN  WHAT HATH MADE HIM REJECT GOD  
   FROM WHAT STUFF HATH HE CREATED HIM  
   FROM A SPERM DROP  HE HATH CREATED HIM  AND THEN MOULDETH HIM IN DUE PROPORTIONS  
   THEN DOTH HE MAKE HIS PATH SMOOTH FOR HIM  
   THEN HE CAUSETH HIM TO DIE  AND PUTTETH HIM IN HIS GRAVE  
   THEN  WHEN IT IS HIS WILL  HE WILL RAISE HIM UP  AGAIN  
   BY NO MEANS HATH HE FULFILLED WHAT GOD HATH COMMANDED HIM 
   THEN LET MAN LOOK AT HIS FOOD   AND HOW WE PROVIDE IT   
   FOR THAT WE POUR FORTH WATER IN ABUNDANCE 
   AND WE SPLIT THE EARTH IN FRAGMENTS 
   AND PRODUCE THEREIN CORN 
   AND GRAPES AND NUTRITIOUS PLANTS 
   AND OLIVES AND DATES 
   AND ENCLOSED GARDENS  DENSE WITH LOFTY TREES 
   AND FRUITS AND FODDER   
   FOR USE AND CONVENIENCE TO YOU AND YOUR CATTLE 
   AT LENGTH WHEN THERE COMES THE DEAFENING NOISE   
   THAT DAY SHALL A MAN FLEE FROM HIS OWN BROTHER 
   AND FROM HIS MOTHER AND HIS FATHER 
   AND FROM HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN 
   EACH ONE OF THEM  THAT DAY  WILL HAVE ENOUGH CONCERN  OF HIS OWN  TO MAKE HIM INDIFFERENT TO THE OTHERS 
   SOME FACES THAT DAY WILL BE BEAMING 
   LAUGHING  REJOICING 
   AND OTHER FACES THAT DAY WILL BE DUST STAINED  
   BLACKNESS WILL COVER THEM  
   SUCH WILL BE THE REJECTERS OF GOD  THE DOERS OF INIQUITY 
   WHEN THE SUN  WITH ITS SPACIOUS LIGHT  IS FOLDED UP  
   WHEN THE STARS FALL  LOSING THEIR LUSTRE  
   WHEN THE MOUNTAINS VANISH  LIKE A MIRAGE   
   WHEN THE SHE CAMELS  TEN MONTHS WITH YOUNG  ARE LEFT UNTENDED  
   WHEN THE WILD BEASTS ARE HERDED TOGETHER  IN HUMAN HABITATIONS   
   WHEN THE OCEANS BOIL OVER WITH A SWELL  
   WHEN THE SOULS ARE SORTED OUT   BEING JOINED  LIKE WITH LIKE   
   WHEN THE FEMALE  INFANT   BURIED ALIVE  IS QUESTIONED 
   FOR WHAT CRIME SHE WAS KILLED  
   WHEN THE SCROLLS ARE LAID OPEN  
   WHEN THE WORLD ON HIGH IS UNVEILED  
   WHEN THE BLAZING FIRE IS KINDLED TO FIERCE HEAT  
   AND WHEN THE GARDEN IS BROUGHT NEAR   
    THEN  SHALL EACH SOUL KNOW WHAT IT HAS PUT FORWARD 
   SO VERILY I CALL TO WITNESS THE PLANETS  THAT RECEDE 
   GO STRAIGHT  OR HIDE  
   AND THE NIGHT AS IT DISSIPATES  
   AND THE DAWN AS IT BREATHES AWAY THE DARKNESS   
   VERILY THIS IS THE WORD OF A MOST HONORABLE MESSENGER 
   ENDUED WITH POWER  WITH RANK BEFORE THE LORD OF THE THRONE 
   WITH AUTHORITY THERE   AND  FAITHFUL TO HIS TRUST 
   AND  O PEOPLE    YOUR COMPANION IS NOT ONE POSSESSED  
   AND WITHOUT DOUBT HE SAW HIM IN THE CLEAR HORIZON 
   NEITHER DOTH HE WITHHOLD GRUDGINGLY A KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNSEEN 
   NOR IS IT THE WORD OF AN EVIL SPIRIT ACCURSED 
   THEN WHITHER GO YE  
   VERILY THIS IS NO LESS THAN A MESSAGE TO  ALL  THE WORLDS  
    WITH PROFIT  TO WHOEVER AMONG YOU WILLS TO GO STRAIGHT  
   BUT YE SHALL NOT WILL EXCEPT AS GOD WILLS   THE CHERISHER OF THE WORLDS 
   WHEN THE SKY IS CLEFT ASUNDER  
   WHEN THE STARS ARE SCATTERED  
   WHEN THE OCEANS ARE SUFFERED TO BURST FORTH  
   AND WHEN THE GRAVES ARE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN   
    THEN  SHALL EACH SOUL KNOW WHAT IT HATH SENT FORWARD AND  WHAT IT HATH  KEPT BACK 
   O MAN   WHAT HAS SEDUCED THEE FROM THY LORD MOST BENEFICENT   
   HIM WHO CREATED THEE  FASHIONED THEE IN DUE PROPORTION  AND GAVE THEE A JUST BIAS  
   IN WHATEVER FORM HE WILLS  DOES HE PUT THEE TOGETHER 
   NAY   BUT YE DO REJECT RIGHT AND JUDGMENT  
   BUT VERILY OVER YOU  ARE APPOINTED ANGELS  TO PROTECT YOU  
   KIND AND HONORABLE   WRITING DOWN  YOUR DEEDS   
   THEY KNOW  AND UNDERSTAND  ALL THAT YE DO 
   AS FOR THE RIGHTEOUS  THEY WILL BE IN BLISS  
   AND THE WICKED  THEY WILL BE IN THE FIRE 
   WHICH THEY WILL ENTER ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 
   AND THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP AWAY THEREFROM 
   AND WHAT WILL EXPLAIN TO THEE WHAT THE DAY OF JUDGMENT IS  
   AGAIN  WHAT WILL EXPLAIN TO THEE WHAT THE DAY OF JUDGMENT IS  
    IT WILL BE  THE DAY WHEN NO SOUL SHALL HAVE POWER  TO DO  AUGHT FOR ANOTHER   FOR THE COMMAND  THAT DAY  WILL BE  WHOLLY  WITH GOD 
   WOE TO THOSE THAT DEAL IN FRAUD  
   THOSE WHO WHEN THEY HAVE TO RECEIVE BY MEASURE FROM MEN  EXACT FULL MEASURE 
   BUT WHEN THEY HAVE TO GIVE BY MEASURE OR WEIGHT TO MEN  GIVE LESS THAN DUE 
   DO THEY NOT THINK THAT THEY WILL BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT   
   ON A MIGHTY DAY 
   A DAY WHEN  ALL  MANKIND WILL STAND BEFORE THE LORD OF THE WORLDS  
   NAY   SURELY THE RECORD OF THE WICKED IS  PRESERVED  IN SIJJĪN 
   AND WHAT WILL EXPLAIN TO THEE WHAT SIJJĪN IS 
    THERE IS  A REGISTER  FULLY  INSCRIBED 
   WOE  THAT DAY  TO THOSE THAT DENY 
   THOSE THAT DENY THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 
   AND NONE CAN DENY IT BUT THE TRANSGRESSOR BEYOND BOUNDS  THE SINNER  
   WHEN OUR SIGNS ARE REHEARSED TO HIM  HE SAYS   TALES OF THE ANCIENTS   
   BY NO MEANS   BUT ON THEIR HEARTS IS THE STAIN OF THE  ILL  WHICH THEY DO  
   VERILY  FROM  THE LIGHT OF  THEIR LORD  THAT DAY  WILL THEY BE VEILED 
   FURTHER  THEY WILL ENTER THE FIRE OF HELL 
   FURTHER  IT WILL BE SAID TO THEM    THIS IS THE  REALITY  WHICH YE REJECTED AS FALSE   
   NAY  VERILY THE RECORD OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS  PRESERVED  IN  ILLĪYĪN 
   AND WHAT WILL EXPLAIN TO THEE WHAT  ILLĪYĪN  IS 
    THERE IS  A REGISTER  FULLY  INSCRIBED 
   TO WHICH BEAR WITNESS THOSE NEAREST  TO GOD  
   TRULY THE RIGHTEOUS WILL BE IN BLISS  
   ON THRONES  OF DIGNITY  WILL THEY COMMAND A SIGHT  OF ALL THINGS   
   THOU WILT RECOGNIZE IN THEIR FACES THE BEAMING BRIGHTNESS OF BLISS 
   THEIR THIRST WILL BE SLAKED WITH PURE WINE SEALED  
   THE SEAL THEREOF WILL BE MUSK   AND FOR THIS LET THOSE ASPIRE  WHO HAVE ASPIRATIONS  
   WITH IT WILL BE  GIVEN  A MIXTURE OF TASNĪM  
   A SPRING  FROM  THE WATERS  WHEREOF DRINK THOSE NEAREST TO GOD 
   THOSE IN SIN USED TO LAUGH AT THOSE WHO BELIEVED 
   AND WHENEVER THEY PASSED BY THEM  USED TO WINK AT EACH OTHER  IN MOCKERY   
   AND WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE  THEY WOULD RETURN JESTING  
   AND WHENEVER THEY SAW THEM  THEY WOULD SAY   BEHOLD   THESE ARE THE PEOPLE TRULY ASTRAY   
   BUT THEY HAD NOT BEEN SENT AS KEEPERS OVER THEM  
   BUT ON THIS DAY THE BELIEVERS WILL LAUGH AT THE UNBELIEVERS  
   ON THRONES  OF DIGNITY  THEY WILL COMMAND  A SIGHT   OF ALL THINGS  
   WILL NOT THE UNBELIEVERS HAVE BEEN PAID BACK FOR WHAT THEY DID  
   WHEN THE SKY IS RENT ASUNDER 
   AND HEARKENS TO  THE COMMAND OF  ITS LORD   AND IT MUST NEEDS  DO SO   
   AND WHEN THE EARTH IS FLATTENED OUT 
   AND CASTS FORTH WHAT IS WITHIN IT AND BECOMES  CLEAN  EMPTY 
   AND HEARKENS TO  THE COMMAND OF  ITS LORD   AND IT MUST NEEDS  DO SO    THEN WILL COME HOME THE FULL REALITY  
   O THOU MAN   VERILY THOU ART EVER TOILING ON TOWARDS THE LORD  PAINFULLY TOILING   BUT THOU SHALT MEET HIM 
   THEN HE WHO IS GIVEN HIS RECORD IN HIS RIGHT HAND 
   SOON WILL HIS ACCOUNT BE TAKEN BY AN EASY RECKONING 
   AND HE WILL TURN TO HIS PEOPLE  REJOICING  
   BUT HE WHO IS GIVEN HIS RECORD BEHIND HIS BACK  
   SOON WILL HE CRY FOR PERDITION 
   AND HE WILL ENTER A BLAZING FIRE 
   TRULY  DID HE GO ABOUT AMONG HIS PEOPLE  REJOICING 
   TRULY  DID HE THINK THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO RETURN  TO US   
   NAY NAY   FOR HIS LORD WAS  EVER  WATCHFUL OF HIM  
   SO I DO CALL TO WITNESS THE RUDDY GLOW OF SUNSET  
   THE NIGHT AND ITS HOMING  
   AND THE MOON IN HER FULLNESS  
   YE SHALL SURELY TRAVEL FROM STAGE TO STAGE 
   WHAT THEN IS THE MATTER WITH THEM  THAT THEY BELIEVE NOT   
   AND WHEN THE QUR ĀN IS READ TO THEM  THEY FALL NOT PROSTRATE 
   BUT ON THE CONTRARY THE UNBELIEVERS REJECT  IT  
   BUT GOD HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THEY SECRETE  IN THEIR BREASTS 
   SO ANNOUNCE TO THEM A PENALTY GRIEVOUS 
   EXCEPT TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND WORK RIGHTEOUS DEEDS   FOR THEM IS A REWARD THAT WILL NEVER FAIL 
   BY THE SKY   DISPLAYING  THE ZODIACAL SIGNS  
   BY THE PROMISED DAY  OF JUDGMENT   
   BY ONE THAT WITNESSES  AND THE SUBJECT OF THE WITNESS   
   WOE TO THE MAKERS OF THE PIT  OF FIRE  
   FIRE SUPPLIED  ABUNDANTLY  WITH FUEL  
   BEHOLD   THEY SAT OVER AGAINST THE  FIRE  
   AND THEY WITNESSED  ALL  THAT THEY WERE DOING AGAINST THE BELIEVERS 
   AND THEY ILL TREATED THEM FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT THEY BELIEVED IN GOD  EXALTED IN POWER WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE   
   HIM TO WHOM BELONGS THE DOMINION OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH   AND GOD IS WITNESS TO ALL THINGS 
   THOSE WHO PERSECUTE  OR DRAW INTO TEMPTATION  THE BELIEVERS  MEN AND WOMEN  AND DO NOT TURN IN REPENTANCE  WILL HAVE THE PENALTY OF HELL   THEY WILL HAVE THE PENALTY OF THE BURNING FIRE 
   FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND DO RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  WILL BE GARDENS  BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW   THAT IS THE GREAT SALVATION   THE FULFILLMENT OF ALL DESIRES  
   TRULY STRONG IS THE GRIP  AND POWER  OF THY LORD 
   IT IS HE WHO CREATES FROM THE VERY BEGINNING  AND HE CAN RESTORE  LIFE  
   AND HE IS THE OFT FORGIVING  FULL OF LOVING KINDNESS 
   LORD OF THE THRONE OF GLORY 
   DOER  WITHOUT LET  OF ALL THAT HE INTENDS 
   HAS THE STORY REACHED THEE  OF THE FORCES 
   OF PHARAOH AND THE THAMUD  
   AND YET THE UNBELIEVERS  PERSIST  IN REJECTING  THE TRUTH   
   BUT GOD DOTH ENCOMPASS THEM FROM BEHIND  
   NAY  THIS IS A GLORIOUS QUR ĀN
    INSCRIBED  IN A TABLET PRESERVED 
   BY THE SKY AND THE NIGHT VISITANT  THEREIN   
   AND WHAT WILL EXPLAIN TO THEE WHAT THE NIGHT VISITANT IS  
    IT IS  THE STAR OF PIERCING BRIGHTNESS  
   THERE IS NO SOUL BUT HAS A PROTECTOR OVER IT 
   NOW LET MAN BUT THINK FROM WHAT HE IS CREATED  
   HE IS CREATED FROM A DROP EMITTED 
   PROCEEDING FROM BETWEEN THE BACKBONE AND THE RIBS  
   SURELY  GOD  IS ABLE TO BRING HIM BACK  TO LIFE   
   THE DAY THAT  ALL  THINGS SECRET WILL BE TESTED 
    MAN  WILL HAVE NO POWER  AND NO HELPER 
   BY THE FIRMAMENT WHICH RETURNS  IN ITS ROUND  
   AND BY THE EARTH WHICH OPENS OUT  FOR THE GUSHING OF SPRINGS OR THE SPROUTING OF VEGETATION   
   BEHOLD THIS IS THE WORD THAT DISTINGUISHES  GOOD FROM EVIL   
   IT IS NOT A THING FOR AMUSEMENT 
   AS FOR THEM  THEY ARE BUT PLOTTING A SCHEME 
   AND I AM PLANNING A SCHEME 
   THEREFORE GRANT A DELAY TO THE UNBELIEVERS  GIVE RESPITE TO THEM GENTLY  FOR A WHILE  
   GLORIFY THE NAME OF THY GUARDIAN LORD MOST HIGH 
   WHO HATH CREATED AND FURTHER  GIVEN ORDER AND PROPORTION  
   WHO HATH ORDAINED LAWS  AND GRANTED GUIDANCE  
   AND WHO BRINGETH OUT THE  GREEN AND LUSCIOUS  PASTURE 
   AND THEN DOTH MAKE IT  BUT  SWARTHY STUBBLE 
   BY DEGREES SHALL WE TEACH THEE TO DECLARE  THE MESSAGE   SO THOU SHALT NOT FORGET 
   EXCEPT AS GOD WILLS   FOR HE KNOWETH WHAT IS MANIFEST AND WHAT IS HIDDEN 
   AND WE WILL MAKE IT EASY FOR THEE  TO FOLLOW  THE SIMPLE  PATH  
   THEREFORE GIVE ADMONITION IN CASE THE ADMONITION PROFITS  THE HEARER  
   THE ADMONITION WILL BE RECEIVED BY THOSE WHO FEAR  GOD   
   BUT IT WILL BE AVOIDED BY THOSE MOST UNFORTUNATE ONES 
   WHO WILL ENTER THE GREAT FIRE 
   IN WHICH THEY WILL THEN NEITHER DIE NOR LIVE 
   BUT THOSE WILL PROSPER WHO PURIFY THEMSELVES 
   AND GLORIFY THE NAME OF THEIR GUARDIAN LORD  AND  LIFT THEIR HEARTS  IN PRAYER 
   NAY  BEHOLD   YE PREFER THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD  
   BUT THE HEREAFTER IS BETTER AND MORE ENDURING 
   AND THIS IS IN THE BOOKS OF THE EARLIEST  REVELATIONS   
   THE BOOKS OF ABRAHAM AND MOSES 
   HAS THE STORY REACHED THEE  OF THE OVERWHELMING  EVENT   
   SOME FACES  THAT DAY WILL BE HUMILIATED 
   LABORING  HARD   WEARY  
   THE WHILE THEY ENTER THE BLAZING FIRE  
   THE WHILE THEY ARE GIVEN  TO DRINK  OF A BOILING HOT SPRING 
   NO FOOD WILL THERE BE FOR THEM BUT A BITTER DHARI 
   WHICH WILL NEITHER NOURISH NOR SATISFY HUNGER 
    OTHER  FACES THAT DAY WILL BE JOYFUL 
   PLEASED WITH THEIR STRIVING  
   IN A GARDEN ON HIGH 
   WHERE THEY SHALL HEAR NO  WORD  OF VANITY  
   THEREIN WILL BE A BUBBLING SPRING  
   THEREIN WILL BE THRONES  OF DIGNITY   RAISED ON HIGH 
   GOBLETS PLACED  READY  
   AND CUSHIONS SET IN ROWS 
   AND RICH CARPETS  ALL  SPREAD OUT 
   DO THEY NOT LOOK AT THE CAMELS  HOW THEY ARE MADE   
   AND AT THE SKY  HOW IT IS RAISED HIGH   
   AND AT THE MOUNTAINS  HOW THEY ARE FIXED FIRM   
   AND AT THE EARTH  HOW IT IS SPREAD OUT  
   THEREFORE DO THOU GIVE ADMONITION  FOR THOU ART ONE TO ADMONISH 
   THOU ART NOT ONE TO MANAGE  MEN S  AFFAIRS 
   BUT IF ANY TURN AWAY AND REJECT GOD  
   GOD WILL PUNISH HIM WITH A MIGHTY PUNISHMENT 
   FOR TO US WILL BE THEIR RETURN  
   THEN IT WILL BE FOR US TO CALL THEM TO ACCOUNT 
   BY THE BREAK OF DAY  
   BY THE NIGHTS TWICE FIVE  
   BY THE EVEN AND ODD  CONTRASTED   
   AND BY THE NIGHT WHEN IT PASSETH AWAY   
   IS THERE  NOT  IN THESE AN ADJURATION  OR EVIDENCE  FOR THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND  
   SEEST THOU NOT HOW THY LORD DEALT WITH THE  AD  PEOPLE   
   OF THE  CITY OF  IRAM  WITH LOFTY PILLARS 
   THE LIKE OF WHICH WERE NOT PRODUCED IN  ALL  THE LAND  
   AND WITH THE THAMUD  PEOPLE   WHO CUT OUT  HUGE  ROCKS IN THE VALLEY   
   AND WITH PHARAOH  LORD OF STAKES  
    ALL  THESE TRANSGRESSED BEYOND BOUNDS IN THE LANDS 
   AND HEAPED THEREIN MISCHIEF  ON MISCHIEF  
   THEREFORE DID THY LORD POUR ON THEM A SCOURGE OF DIVERSE CHASTISEMENTS  
   FOR THY LORD IS  AS A GUARDIAN  ON A WATCH TOWER 
   NOW  AS FOR MAN  WHEN HIS LORD TRIETH HIM  GIVING HIM HONOR AND GIFTS  THEN SAITH HE   PUFFED UP     MY LORD HATH HONOURED ME  
   BUT WHEN HE TRIETH HIM  RESTRICTING HIS SUBSISTENCE FOR HIM  THEN SAITH HE  IN DESPAIR     MY LORD HATH HUMILIATED ME    
   NAY  NAY   BUT YE HONOUR NOT THE ORPHANS  
   NOR DO YE ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER TO FEED THE POOR   
   AND YE DEVOUR INHERITANCE  ALL WITH GREED 
   AND YE LOVE WEALTH WITH INORDINATE LOVE  
   NAY  WHEN THE EARTH IS POUNDED TO POWDER 
   AND THY LORD COMETH  AND HIS ANGELS  RANK UPON RANK 
   AND HELL  THAT DAY  IS BROUGHT  FACE TO FACE    ON THAT DAY WILL MAN REMEMBER  BUT HOW WILL THAT REMEMBRANCE PROFIT HIM  
   HE WILL SAY     AH   WOULD THAT I HAD SENT FORTH  GOOD DEEDS  FOR  THIS  MY  FUTURE  LIFE    
   FOR  THAT DAY  HIS CHASTISEMENT WILL BE SUCH AS NONE  ELSE  CAN INFLICT 
   AND HIS BONDS WILL BE SUCH AS NONE  OTHER  CAN BIND 
    TO THE RIGHTEOUS SOUL WILL BE SAID &COLON     O  THOU  SOUL  IN  COMPLETE  REST AND SATISFACTION  
     COME BACK THOU TO THY LORD   WELL PLEASED  THYSELF   AND WELL PLEASING UNTO HIM  
     ENTER THOU  THEN  AMONG MY DEVOTEES  
    YEA  ENTER THOU MY HEAVEN    
   I DO CALL TO WITNESS THIS CITY   
   AND THOU ART A FREEMAN OF THIS CITY   
   AND  THE MYSTIC TIES OF  PARENT AND CHILD   
   VERILY WE HAVE CREATED MAN INTO TOIL AND STRUGGLE 
   THINKETH HE  THAT NONE HATH POWER OVER HIM  
   HE MAY SAY  BOASTFULLY      WEALTH HAVE I SQUANDERED IN ABUNDANCE    
   THINKETH HE THAT NONE BEHOLDETH HIM  
   HAVE WE NOT MADE FOR HIM A PAIR OF EYES   
   AND A TONGUE  AND A PAIR OF LIPS   
   AND SHOWN HIM THE TWO HIGHWAYS  
   BUT HE HATH MADE NO HASTE ON THE PATH THAT IS STEEP 
   AND WHAT WILL EXPLAIN TO THEE THE PATH THAT IS STEEP   
    IT IS     FREEING THE BONDMAN  
   OR THE GIVING OF FOOD IN A DAY OF PRIVATION
   TO THE ORPHAN WITH CLAIMS OF RELATIONSHIP 
   OR TO THE INDIGENT  DOWN  IN THE DUST 
   THEN WILL HE BE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE  AND ENJOIN PATIENCE   CONSTANCY  AND SELF RESTRAINT   AND ENJOIN DEEDS OF KINDNESS AND COMPASSION 
   SUCH ARE THE COMPANIONS OF THE RIGHT HAND 
   BUT THOSE WHO REJECT OUR SIGNS  THEY ARE THE  UNHAPPY  COMPANIONS OF THE LEFT HAND 
   ON THEM WILL BE FIRE VAULTED OVER  ALL ROUND  
   BY THE SUN AND HIS  GLORIOUS  SPLENDOR  
   BY THE MOON AS SHE FOLLOWS HIM  
   BY THE DAY AS IT SHOWS UP  THE SUN S  GLORY  
   BY THE NIGHT AS IT CONCEALS IT  
   BY THE FIRMAMENT AND ITS  WONDERFUL  STRUCTURE  
   BY THE EARTH AND ITS  WIDE  EXPANSE 
   BY THE SOUL  AND THE PROPORTION AND ORDER GIVEN TO IT  
   AND ITS ENLIGHTENMENT AS TO ITS WRONG AND ITS RIGHT   
   TRULY HE SUCCEEDS THAT PURIFIES IT 
   AND HE FAILS THAT CORRUPTS IT  
   THE THAMUD  PEOPLE  REJECTED  THEIR PROPHET  THROUGH THEIR INORDINATE WRONG DOING 
   BEHOLD THE MOST WICKED MAN AMONG THEM WAS DEPUTED  FOR IMPIETY  
   BUT THE APOSTLE OF GOD SAID TO THEM    IT IS A SHE CAMEL OF GOD   AND  BAR HER NOT FROM  HAVING HER DRINK    
   THEN THEY REJECTED HIM  AS A FALSE PROPHET   AND THEY HAMSTRUNG HER  SO THEIR LORD  ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR CRIME  OBLITERATED THEIR TRACES AND MADE THEM EQUAL  IN DESTRUCTION  HIGH AND LOW   
   AND FOR HIM IS NO FEAR OF ITS CONSEQUENCES 
   BY THE NIGHT AS IT CONCEALS  THE LIGHT   
   BY THE DAY AS IT APPEARS IN GLORY  
   BY  THE MYSTERY OF  THE CREATION OF MALE AND FEMALE   
   VERILY   THE ENDS  YE STRIVE FOR ARE DIVERSE 
   SO HE WHO GIVES  IN CHARITY  AND FEARS  GOD  
   AND  IN ALL SINCERITY  TESTIFIES TO THE BEST  
   WE WILL INDEED MAKE SMOOTH FOR HIM THE PATH TO BLISS 
   BUT HE WHO IS A GREEDY MISER AND THINKS HIMSELF SELF SUFFICIENT 
   AND GIVES THE LIE TO THE BEST  
   WE WILL INDEED MAKE SMOOTH FOR HIM THE PATH TO MISERY  
   NOR WILL HIS WEALTH PROFIT HIM WHEN HE FALLS HEADLONG  INTO THE PIT  
   VERILY WE TAKE UPON OURSELVES TO GUIDE 
   AND VERILY UNTO US  BELONG  THE END AND THE BEGINNING 
   THEREFORE DO I WARN YOU OF A FIRE BLAZING FIERCELY  
   NONE SHALL REACH IT BUT THOSE MOST UNFORTUNATE ONES
   WHO GIVE THE LIE TO TRUTH AND TURN THEIR BACKS 
   BUT THOSE MOST DEVOTED TO GOD SHALL BE REMOVED FAR FROM IT  
   THOSE WHO SPEND THEIR WEALTH FOR INCREASE IN SELF PURIFICATION 
   AND HAVE IN THEIR MINDS NO FAVOR FROM ANYONE FOR WHICH A REWARD IS EXPECTED IN RETURN 
   BUT ONLY THE DESIRE TO SEEK FOR THE COUNTENANCE OF THEIR LORD MOST HIGH  
   AND SOON WILL THEY ATTAIN  COMPLETE  SATISFACTION 
   BY THE GLORIOUS MORNING LIGHT 
   AND BY THE NIGHT WHEN IT IS STILL  
   THY GUARDIAN LORD HATH NOT FORSAKEN THEE  NOR IS HE DISPLEASED 
   AND VERILY THE HEREAFTER WILL BE BETTER FOR THEE THAN THE PRESENT 
   AND SOON WILL THY GUARDIAN LORD GIVE THEE  THAT WHEREWITH  THOU SHALT BE WELL PLEASED 
   DID HE NOT FIND THEE AN ORPHAN AND GIVE THEE SHELTER  AND CARE   
   AND HE FOUND THEE WANDERING  AND HE GAVE THEE GUIDANCE 
   AND HE FOUND THEE IN NEED  AND MADE THEE INDEPENDENT 
   THEREFORE  TREAT NOT THE ORPHAN WITH HARSHNESS 
   NOR REPULSE THE PETITIONER  UNHEARD   
   BUT THE BOUNTY OF THY LORD  REHEARSE AND PROCLAIM  
   HAVE WE NOT EXPANDED THEE THY BREAST   
   AND REMOVED FROM THEE THY BURDEN
   THE WHICH DID GALL THY BACK   
   AND RAISED HIGH THE ESTEEM  IN WHICH  THOU  ART HELD   
   SO VERILY  WITH EVERY DIFFICULTY  THERE IS RELIEF  
   VERILY  WITH EVERY DIFFICULTY THERE IS RELIEF 
   THEREFORE  WHEN THOU ART FREE  FROM THINE IMMEDIATE TASK   STILL LABOR HARD 
   AND TO THY LORD TURN  ALL  THY ATTENTION 
   BY THE FIG AND THE OLIVE 
   AND THE MOUNT OF SINAI 
   AND THIS CITY OF SECURITY  
   WE HAVE INDEED CREATED MAN IN THE BEST OF MOLDS 
   THEN DO WE ABASE HIM  TO BE  THE LOWEST OF THE LOW  
   EXCEPT SUCH AS BELIEVE AND DO RIGHTEOUS DEEDS   FOR THEY SHALL HAVE A REWARD UNFAILING 
   THEN WHAT CAN  AFTER THIS  CONTRADICT THEE  AS TO THE JUDGMENT  TO COME   
   IS NOT GOD THE WISEST OF JUDGES  
   PROCLAIM    OR READ    IN THE NAME OF THY LORD AND CHERISHER  WHO CREATED 
   CREATED MAN OUT OF A  MERE  CLOT OF CONGEALED BLOOD  
   PROCLAIM   AND THY LORD IS MOST BOUNTIFUL  
   HE WHO TAUGHT  THE USE OF  THE PEN  
   TAUGHT MAN THAT WHICH HE KNEW NOT 
   NAY BUT MAN DOTH TRANSGRESS ALL BOUNDS 
   IN THAT HE LOOKETH UPON HIMSELF AS SELF SUFFICIENT 
   VERILY  TO THY LORD IS THE RETURN  OF ALL  
   SEEST THOU ONE WHO FORBIDS 
   A VOTARY WHEN HE  TURNS  TO PRAY  
   SEEST THOU IF HE IS ON  THE ROAD OF  GUIDANCE   
   OR ENJOINS RIGHTEOUSNESS  
   SEEST THOU IF HE DENIES  TRUTH  AND TURNS AWAY  
   KNOWETH HE NOT THAT GOD DOTH SEE  
   LET HIM BEWARE   IF HE DESIST NOT  WE WILL DRAG HIM BY THE FORELOCK  
   A LYING  SINFUL FORELOCK  
   THEN  LET HIM CALL  FOR HELP  TO HIS COUNCIL  OF COMRADES   
   WE WILL CALL ON THE ANGELS OF PUNISHMENT  TO DEAL WITH HIM   
   NAY HEED HIM NOT   BUT BOW DOWN IN ADORATION  AND BRING THYSELF THE CLOSER  TO GOD   
   WE HAVE INDEED REVEALED THIS  MESSAGE  IN THE NIGHT OF POWER  
   AND WHAT WILL EXPLAIN TO THEE WHAT THE NIGHT OF POWER IS  
   THE NIGHT OF POWER IS BETTER THAN A THOUSAND MONTHS 
   THEREIN COME DOWN THE ANGELS AND THE SPIRIT BY GOD S PERMISSION  ON EVERY ERRAND  
   PEACE    THIS UNTIL THE RISE OF MORN  
    THOSE WHO REJECT  TRUTH  AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK AND AMONG THE POLYTHEISTS  WERE NOT GOING TO DEPART  FROM THEIR WAYS  UNTIL THERE SHOULD COME TO THEM CLEAR EVIDENCE  
    AN APOSTLE FROM GOD  REHEARSING SCRIPTURES KEPT PURE AND HOLY  
    WHEREIN ARE LAWS  OR DECREES  RIGHT AND STRAIGHT 
    NOR DID THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK MAKE SCHISMS  UNTIL AFTER THERE CAME TO THEM CLEAR EVIDENCE 
    AND THEY HAVE BEEN COMMANDED NO MORE THAN THIS   TO WORSHIP GOD  OFFERING HIM SINCERE DEVOTION  BEING TRUE  IN FAITH    TO ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER   AND TO PRACTICE REGULAR CHARITY   AND THAT IS THE RELIGION RIGHT AND STRAIGHT 
    THOSE WHO REJECT  TRUTH  AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK AND AMONG THE POLYTHEISTS  WILL BE IN HELL FIRE  TO DWELL THEREIN  FOR AYE   THEY ARE THE WORST OF CREATURES 
    THOSE WHO HAVE FAITH AND DO RIGHTEOUS DEEDS   THEY ARE THE BEST OF CREATURES 
   THEIR REWARD IS WITH GOD   GARDENS OF ETERNITY  BENEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW   THEY WILL DWELL THEREIN FOR EVER   GOD WELL PLEASED WITH THEM  AND THEY WITH HIM   ALL THIS FOR SUCH AS FEAR THEIR LORD AND CHERISHER 
   WHEN THE EARTH IS SHAKEN TO HER  UTMOST  CONVULSION 
   AND THE EARTH THROWS UP HER BURDENS  FROM WITHIN  
   AND MAN CRIES  DISTRESSED      WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH HER     
   ON THAT DAY WILL SHE DECLARE HER TIDINGS  
   FOR THAT THY LORD WILL HAVE GIVEN HER INSPIRATION 
   ON THAT DAY WILL MEN PROCEED IN COMPANIES SORTED OUT  TO BE SHOWN THE DEEDS THAT THEY  HAD DONE  
   THEN SHALL ANYONE WHO HAS DONE AN ATOM S WEIGHT OF GOOD  SEE IT  
   AND ANYONE WHO HAS DONE AN ATOM S WEIGHT OF EVIL  SHALL SEE IT 
   BY THE  STEEDS  THAT RUN  WITH PANTING  BREATH  
   AND STRIKE SPARKS OF FIRE 
   AND PUSH HOME THE CHARGE IN THE MORNING 
   AND RAISE THE DUST IN CLOUDS THE WHILE 
   AND PENETRATE FORTHWITH INTO THE MIDST  OF THE FOE  EN MASSE  
   TRULY MAN IS  TO HIS LORD  UNGRATEFUL  
   AND TO THAT  FACT  HE BEARS WITNESS  BY HIS DEEDS   
   AND VIOLENT IS HE IN HIS LOVE OF WEALTH 
   DOES HE NOT KNOW   WHEN THAT WHICH IS IN THE GRAVES IS SCATTERED ABROAD
   AND THAT WHICH IS  LOCKED UP  IN  HUMAN  BREASTS IS MADE MANIFEST 
   THAT THEIR LORD HAD BEEN WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THEM   EVEN TO  THAT DAY  
   THE  DAY  OF NOISE AND CLAMOUR  
   WHAT IS THE  DAY  OF NOISE AND CLAMOUR  
   AND WHAT WILL EXPLAIN TO THEE WHAT THE  DAY  OF NOISE AND CLAMOUR IS  
    IT IS  A DAY WHEREON MEN WILL BE LIKE MOTHS SCATTERED ABOUT 
   AND THE MOUNTAINS WILL BE LIKE CARDED WOOL 
   THEN  HE WHOSE BALANCE  OF GOOD DEEDS  WILL BE  FOUND  HEAVY 
   WILL BE IN A LIFE OF GOOD PLEASURE AND SATISFACTION 
   BUT HE WHOSE BALANCE  OF GOOD DEEDS  WILL BE  FOUND  LIGHT  
   WILL HAVE HIS HOME IN A  BOTTOMLESS  PIT 
   AND WHAT WILL EXPLAIN TO THEE WHAT THIS IS  
    IT IS  A FIRE BLAZING FIERCELY  
   THE MUTUAL RIVALRY FOR PILING UP  THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS WORLD  DIVERTS YOU  FROM THE MORE SERIOUS THINGS  
   UNTIL YE VISIT THE GRAVES 
   BUT NAY  YE SOON SHALL KNOW  THE REALITY  
   AGAIN  YE SOON SHALL KNOW  
   NAY  WERE YE TO KNOW WITH CERTAINTY OF MIND   YE WOULD BEWARE   
   YE SHALL CERTAINLY SEE HELL FIRE  
   AGAIN  YE SHALL SEE IT WITH CERTAINTY OF SIGHT  
   THEN  SHALL YE BE QUESTIONED THAT DAY ABOUT THE JOY  YE INDULGED IN   
   BY  THE TOKEN OF  TIME  THROUGH THE AGES  
   VERILY MAN IS IN LOSS 
   EXCEPT SUCH AS HAVE FAITH  AND DO RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  AND  JOIN TOGETHER  IN THE MUTUAL TEACHING OF TRUTH  AND OF PATIENCE AND CONSTANCY 
   WOE TO EVERY  KIND OF  SCANDAL MONGER AND BACKBITER 
   WHO PILETH UP WEALTH AND LAYETH IT BY 
   THINKING THAT HIS WEALTH WOULD MAKE HIM LAST FOR EVER  
   BY NO MEANS   HE WILL BE SURE TO BE THROWN INTO THAT WHICH BREAKS TO PIECES 
   AND WHAT WILL EXPLAIN TO THEE THAT WHICH BREAKS TO PIECES 
    IT IS  THE FIRE OF  THE WRATH OF  GOD KINDLED  TO A BLAZE  
   THE WHICH DOTH MOUNT  RIGHT  TO THE HEARTS  
   IT SHALL BE MADE INTO A VAULT OVER THEM 
   IN COLUMNS OUTSTRETCHED 
   SEEST THOU NOT HOW THY LORD DEALT WITH THE COMPANIONS OF THE ELEPHANT  
   DID HE NOT MAKE THEIR TREACHEROUS PLAN GO ASTRAY  
   AND HE SENT AGAINST THEM FLIGHTS OF BIRDS 
   STRIKING THEM WITH STONES OF BAKED CLAY 
   THEN DID HE MAKE THEM LIKE AN EMPTY FIELD OF STALKS AND STRAW  OF WHICH THE CORN  HAS BEEN EATEN UP 
   FOR THE COVENANTS  OF SECURITY AND SAFEGUARD ENJOYED  BY THE QURAISH 
   THEIR COVENANTS  COVERING  JOURNEYS BY WINTER AND SUMMER  
   LET THEM ADORE THE LORD OF THIS HOUSE 
   WHO PROVIDES THEM WITH FOOD AGAINST HUNGER  AND WITH SECURITY AGAINST FEAR  OF DANGER  
   SEEST THOU ONE WHO DENIES THE JUDGMENT  TO COME   
   THEN SUCH IS THE  MAN  WHO REPULSES THE ORPHAN  WITH HARSHNESS  
   AND ENCOURAGES NOT THE FEEDING OF THE INDIGENT 
   SO WOE TO THE WORSHIPPERS
   WHO ARE NEGLECTFUL OF THEIR PRAYERS 
   THOSE WHO  WANT BUT  TO BE SEEN  OF MEN  
   BUT REFUSE  TO SUPPLY   EVEN  NEIGHBOURLY NEEDS 
   TO THEE HAVE WE GRANTED THE FOUNT  OF ABUNDANCE  
   THEREFORE TO THY LORD TURN IN PRAYER AND SACRIFICE 
   FOR HE WHO HATETH THEE   HE WILL BE CUT OFF  FROM FUTURE HOPE  
   SAY  O YE THAT REJECT FAITH  
   I WORSHIP NOT THAT WHICH YE WORSHIP 
   NOR WILL YE WORSHIP THAT WHICH I WORSHIP 
   AND I WILL NOT WORSHIP THAT WHICH YE HAVE BEEN WONT TO WORSHIP 
   NOR WILL YE WORSHIP THAT WHICH I WORSHIP 
   TO YOU BE YOUR WAY  AND TO ME MINE 
   WHEN COMES THE HELP OF GOD  AND VICTORY 
   AND THOU DOST SEE THE PEOPLE ENTER GOD S RELIGION IN CROWDS 
   CELEBRATE THE PRAISES OF THY LORD  AND PRAY FOR HIS FORGIVENESS   FOR HE IS OFT RETURNING  IN GRACE AND MERCY  
   PERISH THE HANDS OF THE FATHER OF FLAME   PERISH HE  
   NO PROFIT TO HIM FROM ALL HIS WEALTH  AND ALL HIS GAINS  
   BURNT SOON WILL HE BE IN A FIRE OF BLAZING FLAME  
   HIS WIFE SHALL CARRY THE  CRACKLING  WOOD   AS FUEL   
   A TWISTED ROPE OF PALM LEAF FIBRE ROUND HER  OWN  NECK  
   SAY  HE IS GOD  THE ONE AND ONLY  
   GOD  THE ETERNAL  ABSOLUTE  
   HE BEGETTETH NOT  NOR IS HE BEGOTTEN  
   AND THERE IS NONE LIKE UNTO HIM 
   SAY  I SEEK REFUGE WITH THE LORD OF THE DAWN 
   FROM THE MISCHIEF OF CREATED THINGS  
   FROM THE MISCHIEF OF DARKNESS AS IT OVERSPREADS  
   FROM THE MISCHIEF OF THOSE WHO PRACTICE SECRET ARTS  
   AND FROM THE MISCHIEF OF THE ENVIOUS ONE AS HE PRACTICES ENVY 
   SAY  I SEEK REFUGE WITH THE LORD AND CHERISHER OF MANKIND 
   THE KING  OR RULER  OF MANKIND 
   THE GOD  OR JUDGE  OF MANKIND   
   FROM THE MISCHIEF OF THE WHISPERER  OF EVIL  WHO WITHDRAWS  AFTER HIS WHISPER   
    THE SAME  WHO WHISPERS INTO THE HEARTS OF MANKIND  
   AMONG JINNS AND AMONG MEN
