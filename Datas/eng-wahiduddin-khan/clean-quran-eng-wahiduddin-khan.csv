ï»¿in the name of god  the most gracious  the most merciful 
all praise is due to god  the lord of the universe 
the beneficent  the merciful 
lord of the day of judgement 
you alone we worship  and to you alone we turn for help 
guide us to the straight path 
the path of those you have blessed  not of those who have incurred your wrath  nor of those who have gone astray 
alif lam mim 
this is the book  there is no doubt in it it is a guide for those who are mindful of god 
who believe in the unseen  and are steadfast in prayer  and spend out of what we have provided them with 
those who believe in the revelation sent down to you and in what was sent before you  and firmly believe in the life to come   
they are the people who are rightly following their lord and it is they who shall be successful 
as for those who are bent on denying the truth  it makes no difference to them whether you warn them or not  they will not believe 
god has sealed their hearts and their ears  and over their eyes there is a covering they will have a terrible punishment 
there are some who say   we believe in god and the last day   yet they are not believers 
they seek to deceive god and the believers  but they only deceive themselves  though they do not realize it 
in their hearts is a disease  which god has increased they will have a painful punishment  because they have been lying 
when they are told   do not cause corruption in the land   they say   we are only promoters of peace  
but it is they who are really causing corruption  though they do not realize it 
and when they are told   believe as other people have believed   they say   are we to believe just as fools believe   surely they are the fools  even though they do not realize it 
when they meet those who believe  they say   we believe   but when they are alone with their evil leaders  they say   we are really with you  we were only mocking  
god will requite them for their mockery  and draw them on  for a while  to wander blindly in their insolence 
such are those who have taken misguidance in exchange for guidance  but their bargain does not profit them  nor have they found true guidance 
they are like those who kindled a fire  and when it lighted up all around them  god took away their sight and left them in utter darkness  unable to see   
deaf  dumb  and blind  they will never return to the right path 
or their case is like that of heavy rain pouring down from the clouds  accompanied by darkness  thunder and lightning  they thrust their fingers in their ears at the sound of thunderclaps for fear of death god thus encompasses those who deny the truth 
the lightning almost takes away their sight  whenever it flashes upon them  they walk on  but as soon as darkness falls around them  they stand still indeed  if god pleased  he could take away their hearing and their sight  god has power over all things 
people  worship your lord  who created you and those before you  so that you may become righteous 
who made the earth a bed  and the sky a canopy  and it is he who sends down rain from above for the growth of every kind of food for your sustenance and do not knowingly set up rivals to god 
if you are in doubt about the revelation we have sent down to our servant  then produce a single chapter like it  and call upon your helpers besides god  if you are truthful 
but if you cannot do it  and you can never do it  then guard yourselves against the fire whose fuel is men and stones  prepared for those who deny the truth 
give the good news to those who believe and do good works  that they will have gardens through which rivers flow  whenever they are given fruit to eat they will say   this is what we were provided with before   because they were given similar things and there will be pure spouses for them  and they will abide there forever 
god does not disdain to give a parable about a gnat or a smaller creature the faithful know that it is the truth from their lord  but those who deny the truth ask   what could god mean by this parable   he lets many go astray through it  and guides many by it but he makes only the disobedient go astray 
those who break god s covenant after they have pledged to keep it  and sever whatever god has ordered to be joined  and spread corruption in the land    it is they who are the losers 
how can you disbelieve in god when you were dead lifeless and he gave you life he will let you die once more  then bring you back to life again  whereupon you will be returned to him 
it is he who created everything on the earth for you  then he turned towards heaven and fashioned it into the seven heavens he has knowledge of all things 
when your lord said to the angels   i am putting a successor on earth   they said   will you place someone there who will cause corruption on it and shed blood  while we glorify you with your praise and extol your holiness   god answered   surely  i know that which you do not know  
he taught adam all the names  then he set them before the angels and said   tell me the names of these  if what you say be true  
they said   glory be to you  we have no knowledge except whatever you have taught us you are the all knowing  the all wise  
then he said   o adam  tell them their names   when adam had told them the names  god said to the angels   did i not say to you  i know the secrets of the heavens and of the earth  and i know what you reveal and what you conceal  
when we said to the angels   bow down before adam   they all bowed except for iblis satan he refused and acted proudly and became an unbeliever 
we said   o adam  live with your wife in paradise and eat freely from it anywhere you may wish yet do not approach this tree lest you become wrongdoers  
but satan caused them both to slip through this and thus brought about the loss of their former state we said   go down from here as enemies to each other  and on earth you shall have your abode and your livelihood for a while  
then adam received some words of prayer from his lord and he accepted his repentance he is the forgiving one  the merciful 
we said   go down  all of you  from here  then when guidance comes to you from me  anyone who follows my guidance will have no fear  nor will they grieve   
those who deny and reject our signs shall be the inhabitants of the fire  therein shall they abide forever  
children of israel  remember the favours i have bestowed upon you  and fulfil the covenant that you made with me i shall fulfil the covenant i made with you fear me alone 
and believe in the message i have sent down which fulfils that predictions about the last prophet in their scripture which you already possess and do not be foremost among those who deny its truth do not sell my revelations for a paltry price  fear me alone 
do not mix truth with falsehood  or hide the truth when you know it 
attend to your prayers  give the zakat prescribed alms and bow down with those who bow down 
do you admonish others to do good and forget this yourselves yet you read the book will you not then understand 
seek help with patience and prayer  this is indeed an exacting discipline  but not to the humble 
who know for certain that they will meet their lord  and that they will return to him 
children of israel  remember my blessing which i have bestowed on you  and how i favoured you above all other people 
guard yourselves against the day on which no soul shall in the least avail another  when neither intercession nor ransom shall be accepted from it nor shall help be given to it 
remember when we delivered you from pharaoh s people  who subjected you to grievous torment  slaying your sons and sparing only your daughters  surely in that there was a great trial for you from your lord 
and when we divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned pharaoh s people  while you looked on 
we appointed for moses forty nights on mount sinai   and in his absence you took to worshipping the calf  and thus became transgressors 
yet after that we pardoned you  so that you might be grateful 
remember when we gave moses the scripture  and the criterion to distinguish between right and wrong   so that you might be guided 
when moses said to his people   o my people  you have indeed wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf  turn in repentance to your creator and slay the culprits among you that course is best for you in the sight of your maker   he relented towards you he is the forgiving one  the merciful 
remember when you said   moses  we will not believe in you until we see god with our own eyes   a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on 
then we brought you back to life after your death  so that you might be grateful 
then we caused the clouds to provide shade for you and sent down for you manna and quails  saying   eat the good things we have provided for you   indeed  they did not wrong us  but they wronged themselves 
remember when we said   enter this land and eat freely wherever you will make your way through the gates  bowing down and saying   god  forgive us our sins   we shall forgive you your sins and we shall give abundance to those who do good  
but the wrongdoers changed the words to something other than what they had been told so we sent down upon the transgressors a punishment from heaven  because they were disobedient 
when moses prayed for water for his people  we said to him   strike the rock with your staff   and there gushed out from it twelve springs each tribe knew its drinking place we said    eat and drink what god has provided and do not act wrongfully in the land  spreading corruption  
when you said   moses  we cannot bear to eat only one kind of food  so pray to your lord to bring forth for us some of the earth s produce  its herbs and cucumbers  its garlic  lentils  and onions   moses said   would you take a lesser thing in exchange for what is better go to some town and there you will find all that you demand   abasement and destitution were stamped upon them  and they incurred the wrath of god  for having rejected his signs  and they killed his prophets unjustly  because they were rebels and transgressors 
the believers  the jews  the christians  and the sabaeans  all those who believe in god and the last day and do good deeds  will be rewarded by their lord  they shall have no fear  nor shall they grieve 
 children of israel   we made a covenant with you and raised the mountain high above you  saying   hold fast to what we have given you and bear its contents in mind  so that you may guard yourselves against evil  
yet after that you turned away  and but for god s grace and mercy  you would have surely been among the losers 
you are aware of those who transgressed in the matter of the sabbath  whereupon we said to them   be as apes  despised  
we made their fate an example to their own generation and to those who followed them and a lesson to those who fear god 
when moses said to his people   god commands you to sacrifice a heifer   they said   are you making a mockery of us   he answered   god forbid that i should be so ignorant  
they said   ask your lord to make it clear to us what sort of heifer she should be   he answered   god says she should be neither too old nor too young  but in between  so do as you are commanded  
they said   call on your lord for us  to show us what colour she should be   he answered   god says she should be a bright yellow heifer  pleasing to the eye  
they said   ask your lord to make it clear to us the exact type of heifer she should be  for to us all heifers look alike if god wills  we shall be rightly guided  
moses answered   your lord says  she should be a heifer which has not been yoked to plough the land or water the fields  a heifer free from any blemish    now you have told us the truth   they answered  and they sacrificed it  though they would rather not have done it 
then  when you israelites killed someone and started to blame one another  god brought to light what you concealed 
we said   strike the corpse with a part of it   thus god restores the dead to life and shows you his signs  so that you may understand 
then your hearts became as hard as rock or even harder  for  there are rocks from which streams gush forth  and  there are some that cleave asunder and water flows out from them  while others fall down for fear of god god is not unaware of what you do 
do you then hope that they will believe in you when some of them have already heard the word of god and then  after having understood it  they knowingly perverted it 
when they meet the faithful  they say   we are believers   but when alone  they say to each other   must you tell them what god has revealed to us they will only use it to argue against you before your lord  have you no sense  
do they not know that god knows all that they conceal and all that they disclose 
there are among them unlettered people who have no real knowledge of the scriptures  knowing only their own wishful thinking and following only conjecture 
woe to those who write the scripture with their own hands  and then declare   this is from god   in order to sell it for a paltry price woe to them because of what their own hands have written  and woe to them for what they have earned 
they say   the fire is not going to touch us  and even if it does   it will only be for a few days   say to them    have you received a promise from god  for god never breaks his promise  or do you attribute something to god which you do not know  
truly  those who do evil and are encompassed by their misdeeds  shall be the inmates of the fire therein they shall abide forever 
but those who believe and do good works are the heirs of paradise  there they shall abide forever 
remember when we made a covenant with the children of israel   worship none but god and be good to your parents and to relatives and orphans and the needy and speak kindly to people attend to your prayers and pay the zakat prescribed alms   but with the exception of a few  you turned away in aversion and paid no heed 
when we made a covenant with you  we said   you shall not shed each other s blood  nor turn your people out of their homes   you consented to this and bore witness 
yet  here you are  slaying one another and driving some of your own people from their homelands  aiding one another against them  committing sin and aggression  but if they came to you as captives  you would ransom them surely their very expulsion was unlawful for you do you believe in one part of the book and deny another part of it those of you who act thus shall be rewarded with disgrace in this world and with a severe punishment on the day of resurrection god is never unaware of what you do 
such are they who buy the life of this world at the price of the hereafter their punishment shall not be lightened for them  nor shall they be helped 
to moses we gave the book and sent a succession of messengers after him we gave jesus  son of mary  clear signs and strengthened him with the holy spirit but  whenever a messenger came to you with something which you did not desire  you grew arrogant  calling some liars and slaying others 
they say   our hearts are impenetrably wrapped against whatever you say    but god has rejected them for their denial  they have but little faith 
and now that a book has come to them from god  fulfilling that predictions about the final prophet in their scriptures which is with them  they deny it  whereas previously they used to pray for victory against the disbelievers  yet when there came to them that which they recognized as the truth  they rejected it god s rejection is the due of all who deny the truth 
what they have sold their souls for is evil  to the denial of god s own revelation  grudging that he should reveal his bounty to whom he chooses from among his servants  they have incurred wrath upon wrath humiliating punishment awaits those who deny the truth 
when they are told   believe in what god has revealed   they say   we believe in what was revealed to us   while they deny the truth in what has been sent down after that  even though it is the truth  confirming that which they already have say   why did you kill god s prophets in the past  if you were true believers 
moses came to you with clear signs  but in his absence you worshipped the calf and became wrongdoers  
when we made a covenant with you and raised the mountain above you saying   hold firmly to what we have given you and listen   you said   we hear  but we disobey   and their hearts were filled with the love of the calf  because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth say   evil is that to which your faith enjoins you if you are indeed believers  
say   if god s abode of the hereafter is for you alone  to the exclusion of all others  then wish for death  if you are truthful  
but they will never wish for death  because of what their own hands have sent on before them  god is fully aware of the wrongdoers 
you will find them clinging to life more eagerly than any other people  even the polytheists any of them would wish to be given a life of a thousand years  though even such a long life would not save them from our punishment  and god sees all that they do 
say   anyone who is an enemy of gabriel  who by god s leave has brought down to your heart the quran fulfilling that predictions about the last prophet in the earlier revelations which precedes it  and is a guidance and good news for the faithful 
whoever is an enemy of god  his angels  or his messengers  or of gabriel or michael  will surely find that god too is the enemy of those who deny the truth  
we have sent down clear signs to you and no one will reject them except the wicked 
why is it that  whenever they make a covenant  some of them cast it aside most of them do not believe 
whenever a messenger from god has come to them  fulfilling that predictions which they already had  some of those to whom the book was given have cast off the book of god behind their backs as if they had no knowledge 
they pursued what the devils falsely attributed to the kingdom of solomon solomon was not an unbeliever  it is the devils who are unbelievers they taught people witchcraft  and that which was sent down to harut and marut  the two angels in babylon but these two taught no one until they had said   we are but a trial  therefore  do not disbelieve in god s guidance   so men learnt from them that by which they caused discord between man and wife  but they harmed no one thereby  except by the command of god  on the contrary   these people learned that which would harm them and do them no good  knowing full well that whoever acquired this knowledge would have no share in the hereafter evil indeed was the price for which they sold their souls  if only they had known it 
and had they but believed and been mindful of god  his reward would have been far better for them  if they had but known it 
believers  do not say to the prophet   ra ina  but say   unzurna   and listen to him with attention for those who deny the truth  there is a painful punishment 
they who deny the truth from among the people of the book  or from among those who associate partners with god  do not desire that any good should be sent down to you from your lord but god singles out for his grace whom he wills    for god is limitless in his great bounty 
if we abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten  we will replace it by a better one or one similar to it do you not know that god has power over all things 
do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to god alone and that there is no protector or helper for you besides god 
do you all want to question your messenger just as moses was questioned previously anyone who exchanges faith for unbelief has strayed from the right path 
many among the people of the book wish  through envy  to lead you back to unbelief  now that you have embraced the faith and the truth has been made plain to them but you should pardon them and bear with them until god gives his command truly  god has power over all things 
attend to your prayers and pay the prescribed alms  any good you store up for yourselves  you will find it with god certainly  god sees what you do 
they declare   none shall ever enter heaven unless he be a jew or a christian   this is their own wishful thinking prophet   say   produce your evidence if you are telling the truth  
indeed  those who submit themselves to god and act righteously shall be rewarded by their lord  they shall have no fear  nor shall they grieve 
the jews say   the christians have no ground to stand on   and the christians say   the jews have no ground to stand on   yet they both recite the book  and those who have no knowledge say the same  god will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning their disputes 
who could be more wicked than someone who prevents god s name from being mentioned in his places of worship  and seeks to bring about their ruin  while it behoves these men to enter them with fear in their hearts there is disgrace in store for them in this world and a great punishment in the next 
the east and the west belong to god whichever way you turn  there is the face of god god is all pervading and all knowing 
they say   god has taken a son   glory be to him  everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to him  all things are obedient to him 
he is the originator of the heavens and the earth  and when he decrees something  he says only   be   and it is 
those who are devoid of knowledge say   why does god not speak to us or show us a sign   the same demand was made by those before them  their hearts are all alike we have made the signs clear to those whose faith is firm 
we have sent you with the truth  bearing good news and giving warning you will not be held accountable for the people of the fire 
neither the christians nor the jews will be pleased with you until you follow their ways say   god s guidance is the only true guidance   if you followed their desires after the knowledge which has come to you  you would not have any patron or supporter against god 
those whom we have given this book follow it as it ought to be followed  it is they who truly believe in it  those who deny it will be the losers 
children of israel  remember my favour which i have bestowed upon you  and how i preferred you above all other people 
and fear a day when no human being shall avail another nor shall ransom be accepted from any of them  nor shall intercession be of any use to them  and none shall be succoured 
when his lord tested abraham with certain commands and he fulfilled them  he said   i will make you a leader of men   abraham asked   and what of my descendants   he answered   my covenant does not extend to the transgressors  
and we made the house the ka bah a place of assembly and a sanctuary for mankind  saying    make the place where abraham stood a place of worship   we commanded abraham and ishmael   purify my house for those who walk round it  those who stay there for devotion  and those who bow down and prostrate themselves  
and when abraham prayed   my lord  make this city a city of peace  and provide its inhabitants with fruits  such of them as believe in god and the last day   god said   as for those who deny the truth  i will grant them benefits for a short while and then subject them to the punishment of the fire    an evil destination  
and when abraham and ishmael were laying the foundations of the house  they prayed    our lord  accept this from us  for you are all hearing  all knowing 
lord  make us submissive to you  make of our descendants a nation that will submit to you teach us our rites of worship and turn to us with mercy  you are the forgiving one and the merciful 
our lord  send forth to them a messenger of their own to recite your revelations to them  to teach them the scripture and wisdom  and purify them you are the mighty  the wise one  
who but a foolish man would turn away from the religion of abraham we chose him in this world  and in the hereafter he shall be among the righteous 
when his lord said to him   surrender   he responded   i have surrendered to the lord of the universe  
and abraham enjoined his sons to do the same  as did jacob   my sons  god has chosen this religion for you  so do not let death overtake you  except when you are in a state of submission  
were you present when jacob faced the hour of death and he asked his sons   who will you worship after me   they answered   we will worship your god and the god of your fathers  abraham and ishmael and isaac  the one god  we have submitted ourselves to him  
those were a people that have passed away  what they did is theirs and what you have done is yours you will not be answerable for their deeds 
they say   be jews or christians  and you shall be rightly guided   say   by no means  we believe in the faith of abraham  who was ever inclined to god   he was not one of those who set up partners with god  
say   we believe in god and what was revealed to us  and what was revealed to abraham  ishmael  isaac  jacob  and their descendants  and what was given to moses and jesus and what was given to the other prophets by their lord we make no distinction between any of them it is to him that we surrender ourselves  
if they believe as you have believed  then are they rightly guided  but if they turn back  then know that they are entrenched in hostility god will surely suffice to defend you against them  for he is all hearing  all knowing 
we take on god s own dye who has a better dye than god s we worship him alone 
say   do you dispute with us about god  while he is our lord and your lord we have our actions and you have your actions we are devoted to him alone 
do you claim that abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and their descendants were all jews or christians   say   do you know better or does god and who could be more unjust than one who conceals a testimony given to him by god god is not unaware of what you do  
those were a people that have passed away  theirs is what they did and yours what you have done you shall not be answerable for their deeds 
the foolish will ask   what has made them turn away from their direction of prayer which they used to face   say   the east and the west belong to god he guides whom he pleases to the right path  
thus we have made you a middle nation  so that you may act as witnesses for mankind  and the messenger may be a witness for you we decreed your former prayer direction towards which you used to face only in order that we might make a clear distinction between the messenger s true followers and those who were to turn their backs on him this was indeed a hard test for all but those whom god has guided god will never let your faith go to waste god is compassionate and merciful to mankind 
we have frequently seen you turn your face towards heaven so we will make you turn in a direction for prayer that will please you so turn your face now towards the sacred mosque  and wherever you may be  turn your faces towards it those who were given the book know this to be the truth from their lord god is not unaware of what they do 
but even if you should produce every kind of sign for those who have been given the book  they would never accept your prayer direction  nor would you accept their prayer direction  nor would any of them accept one another s direction if  after all the knowledge you have been given  you yield to their desires  then  you shall surely become a transgressor 
those to whom we have given the book recognize it just as they recognize their own sons but  some of them knowingly conceal the truth 
truth is what comes from your lord  therefore  do not be of those who doubt 
each community has its own direction in which it turns  vie  then  with one another in doing good works wherever you may be  god will bring you all before him god has power over all things 
wherever you set out from  turn your face in the direction of the sacred mosque    this is the truth from your lord  he is not unaware of what you do   
wherever you come from  turn your face to the sacred mosque  wherever you may be  turn your faces towards it  so that people will not have any argument against you except for the wrongdoers among them do not fear them  fear me  so that i may perfect my favour to you and you may be rightly guided 
thus we have sent among you a messenger of your own to recite our revelations to you  purify you and teach you the book and wisdom  and to teach you what you did not know 
so remember me  i will remember you be thankful to me and do not be ungrateful 
you who believe  seek help through patience and prayer  surely  god is with the steadfast 
do not say that those who are killed in god s cause are dead  they are alive  but you are not aware of it 
we shall certainly test you with fear and hunger  and loss of property  lives and crops give good news to those who endure with fortitude 
those who say  when afflicted with a calamity   we belong to god and to him we shall return  
are the ones who will have blessings and mercy from their lord  it is they who are on the right path 
safa and marwah are among the symbols set up by god  there is nothing wrong if anyone goes on a pilgrimage to the house  or performs a minor pilgrimage  in walking to and fro between them of anyone who does good of his own accord  god is appreciative  and aware 
those who conceal the evidence of the truth and the guidance we have revealed  after we have made them clear to people in the scripture  will be rejected by god and so do others 
but from those who repent and mend their ways and make known the truth  i will certainly accept their repentance  i am the ever relenting  the most merciful 
those who deny the truth  and die as deniers  on them shall be the curse of god and of angels and of men altogether 
under it they shall remain forever  their punishment shall not be lightened  nor shall they be granted respite 
your god is one god there is no deity save him he is the compassionate  the merciful 
in the creation of the heavens and the earth  in the alternation of night and day  in the ships that sail the ocean bearing cargoes beneficial to man  in the water which god sends down from the sky and with which he revives the earth after its death  scattering over it all kinds of animals  in the courses of the winds  and in the clouds pressed into service between earth and sky  there are indeed signs for people who use their reason 
yet there are some who set up equals with god and adore them with the adoration due to god  but those who believe love god most if only the wrongdoers could see  as they will see when they face the punishment  that all power belongs to god  and that god is severe in punishment 
when they face their punishment  those who have been followed will disown their followers  and all their ties shall be cut asunder 
those who followed will say   if we could only return to the world  we would disown them as they have disowned us   god will thus show them their actions as a cause of bitter regret and remorse they shall never emerge from the fire 
o mankind  eat whatever is lawful and wholesome on the earth  and do not follow in the footsteps of satan  for he is indeed your avowed enemy 
he bids you only to do evil and to commit deeds of abomination and to attribute to god something of which you have no knowledge 
but when they are told   follow what god has sent down   they answer   we will follow the ways of our fathers   even though their fathers did not use their reason  and were devoid of all guidance 
those who deny the truth are like animals which hear nothing in your call but the sound of a voice  without understanding its meaning they are deaf  dumb and blind they understand nothing 
believers  eat the wholesome things which we have provided for you and give thanks to god  if it is him you worship 
he has forbidden you only carrion  blood  and the flesh of swine  also any flesh that is consecrated other than in the name of god but for one who is driven by necessity  neither craving nor transgressing  it is no sin for god is forgiving and merciful 
those who conceal any part of the scriptures which god has revealed in order to gain some paltry end  simply fill their bellies with fire on the day of resurrection  god will neither speak to them nor purify them they will have a painful punishment 
those are the ones who have taken error in exchange for guidance and punishment for forgiveness how little do they seem to fear the fire 
that is because god has sent down the book with the truth and those who pursue differences in the scriptures go much too far in dissension 
virtue does not consist in whether you face towards the east or the west  virtue means believing in god  the last day  the angels  the book and the prophets  the virtuous are those who  despite their love for it  give away their wealth to their relatives and to orphans and the very poor  and to travellers and those who ask for charity   and to set slaves free  and who attend to their prayers and pay the alms  and who keep their pledges when they make them  and show patience in hardship and adversity  and in times of distress such are the true believers  and such are the god fearing 
believers  retribution is prescribed for you in cases of murder  the free man for the free man  the slave for the slave  the female for the female if the offender is granted some remission by the heir of the slain person  the agreed penalty should be equitably exacted and should be discharged in a handsome manner this is an alleviation from your lord and an act of grace he who transgresses after this shall have a painful punishment 
in this law of retribution there is life for you  o people of understanding  so that perhaps you will be mindful of god 
it is prescribed that when death approaches any of you and he is leaving behind wealth  he shall make a will in favour of his parents and relatives equitably this is a duty for all who fear god 
anyone who alters it once he has heard it shall be accountable for his crime surely  god is all hearing and all knowing 
but if anyone apprehends partiality or an injustice on the part of a testator  it shall be no sin for him to bring about a settlement between the parties god is forgiving and merciful 
believers  fasting has been prescribed for you  just as it was prescribed for those before you  so that you may guard yourselves against evil 
fast for a specified number of days  but if any one among you is ill or on a journey  let him fast the same number of days later for those who can fast only with extreme difficulty  there is a way to compensate    the feeding of a needy person but he who does good of his own accord shall be well rewarded  but to fast is better for you  if you only knew 
the month of ramadan is the month when the quran was sent down as guidance for mankind with clear proofs of guidance and the criterion by which to distinguish right from wrong therefore  whoever of you is present in that month  let him fast  but he who is ill or on a journey shall fast a similar number of days later on god desires ease for you  not hardship he desires you to fast the whole month  so that you may glorify him for his having guided you and so that you may be grateful to him 
when my servants ask you about me  say that i am near i respond to the call of one who calls  whenever he calls to me  let them  then  respond to me  and believe in me  so that they may be rightly guided 
it has been made lawful for you to go to your wives on the night of the fast  they are like a garment for you  and you are like a garment for them god is aware that you were deceiving yourselves and he has turned in mercy towards you and pardoned you so you may now consort with them and seek what god has ordained for you eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct from the black then resume the fast until nightfall  and do not approach them during the nights of your devotional retreat in the mosques these are the limits set by god  so do not approach them thus he makes clear his commandments to mankind  so that they may guard themselves against evil 
do not consume one another s property by unjust means  nor offer it as a bribe to the authorities  so that you may deliberately and wrongfully devour a part of other people s wealth 
they ask you about the phases of the moon say   they are a means of determining time for the regulation of people s affairs and for the pilgrimage   piety does not consist in entering your houses from the rear indeed  one who guards himself against evil out of fear of god is the truly righteous one enter your houses by their doors and be mindful of god  so that you may prosper 
and fight in god s cause against those who wage war against you  but do not commit aggression    for surely  god does not love aggressors 
slay them wherever you find them those who fight against you   drive them out of the places from which they drove you  for religious persecution is worse than killing do not fight them at the sacred mosque unless they fight you there if they do fight you  slay them  such is the reward for those who deny the truth 
but if they desist  then surely god is most forgiving and merciful 
fight them until there is no more fitna religious persecution and religion belongs to god alone if they desist  then let there be no hostility  except towards aggressors 
a sacred month for a sacred month  violation of sanctity calls for fair retribution thus you may exact retribution from whoever transgresses against you  in proportion to his transgression fear god and know that god is with those who are mindful of him 
spend for god s cause  do not cast yourselves into destruction by your own hands do good  god loves the doers of good 
perform the hajj and the minor pilgrimage umrah for the sake of god if you are prevented from doing so  then make whatever offering you can afford and do not shave your heads until the offering has reached the place of sacrifice but if any of you is ill  or has an ailment of the head  he should compensate by fasting or almsgiving or sacrifice in times of peace  if any of you combines the minor pilgrimage with the hajj  he should make whatever offering he can afford  but if he lacks the means  then let him fast three days during the pilgrimage and for seven days after his return  that is  ten days in all that is incumbent upon anyone whose family does not live near the sacred mosque fear god and know that god is severe in punishment 
the pilgrimage is in the appointed months whoever intends to perform it during them must abstain from indecent speech  from all wicked conduct  and from quarrelling while on the pilgrimage whatever good you may do  god is aware of it make provision for yourselves    but surely  the best of all provision is god consciousness always be mindful of me  you that are endowed with understanding 
you will be committing no sin if during the pilgrimage you seek to obtain any bounty from your lord when you return from arafat  remember god at the sacred place  and remember him as he has guided you before this you were surely astray 
then press on from where the pilgrims stream forth and ask god s forgiveness god is ever forgiving and most merciful 
when you have performed the acts of worship prescribed for you  celebrate the praises of god as you celebrated the praises of your fathers  or even more fervently than that there are some who say   our lord  give us abundance in this world   these shall have no share in the world to come 
but there are others who pray   our lord  grant us good in this world as well as good in the world to come  and protect us from the torment of the fire  
they shall have a good share from what they have earned god is swift in his reckoning 
remember god during the appointed days  for one who hastens to leave in two days  it shall be no sin  and for one who stays on  it shall be no sin for him either this is for one who fears god have fear of god  and know that you shall all be gathered before him 
there are some men whose views on the affairs of this life may please you they even call on god to witness whatever is in their heart  yet they are the most contentious of quarrellers 
when he turns away  he sets out to spread corruption in the land  destroying crops and cattle god does not love corruption 
when he is told   have fear of god   he is seized by pride which drives him to wrongdoing hell shall be enough for him a dreadful resting place 
but there are others who would dedicate themselves to seeking the pleasure of god god is compassionate to his servants 
believers  surrender yourselves totally to god  and do not follow in the footsteps of satan  surely  he is your sworn enemy 
but if you lapse after the clear signs that have come to you  then know that god is mighty and wise 
are they only waiting for god as well as the angels to come down to them under canopies of clouds  so that the matter will be settled all things return to god 
ask the children of israel how many clear signs we have given them anyone who changes god s blessing once it has come to him will find god is stern in punishment 
the life of this world is made to appear attractive for those who deny the truth and they scoff at those who believe but those who fear god shall be above them on the day of resurrection  god bestows his bounties on whoever he pleases without stinting 
mankind was once a single community  but then people developed differences   so god sent prophets to them as bearers of good tidings and warning  and sent down with them the book containing the truth  so that he might judge between their disputes it was only those to whom it the scripture was given who disagreed about it after clear signs had come to them  because of rivalry between them god by his will guided the believers to the truth about which the others had disputed god guides whom he will to a straight path 
do you think that you will enter paradise without having suffered like those who passed away before you affliction and hardship befell them and so shaken were they that the messenger and the believers with him would exclaim   when will god s help come   surely the help of god is near 
they will ask you what they should spend on others say   whatever you give should be for parents  close relatives  orphans  the needy  and travellers god is well aware of whatever good you do  
fighting in defence is ordained for you  abhorrent as it may be to you you may dislike something although it is good for you  or like something although it is bad for you  god knows but you do not 
they ask you about fighting in the sacred month say   to fight in a sacred month is a grave matter  but barring people from the path of god  to deny him  and expelling people from the sacred mosque are far graver in his sight  and persecution is worse than killing   they will not stop fighting you until they make you renounce your faith  if they can whoever of you turns back from his faith and dies as a denier of the truth will have his deeds come to nothing in this world and the hereafter  and he will be an inhabitant of the fire  to abide therein forever 
but those who have believed  migrated  and striven for god s cause  can look forward to god s mercy  god is forgiving and merciful 
they ask you prophet about intoxicants and gambling say   there is great sin in both  although they have some benefit for people  but their harm is greater than their benefit   they ask you what they should spend in god s cause say   whatever is surplus to your needs   thus god makes his commandments clear to you so that you may reflect
upon this world and the hereafter they ask you about orphans say   promotion of their welfare is an act of great goodness there is no harm in your living together with them  for they are your brothers god knows the mischief maker from the reformer if god had so willed  he would have afflicted you with hardship surely  god is mighty and wise  
do not marry women who associate partners with god until they believe a believing bondwoman is better than a woman who associates partners with god  however pleasing she may appear to you nor give believing women in marriage to men who associate partners with god  till they have believed  a believing bondman is certainly better than a man who associates partners with god  even though he may please you such people call you to hell fire  but god calls you to paradise and to forgiveness he makes his messages clear to people  so that they might bear them in mind 
they ask you about menstruation say   it is an impurity  so keep away from women during it and do not approach them until they are cleansed  when they are cleansed you may approach them as god has ordained god loves those who turn to him in penitence and he loves those who keep themselves clean 
your wives are your fields go  then  into your fields as you will do good deeds  and fear god  and know that you shall meet him   give good tidings to the believers 
do not make god a pretext  when you swear by him  to avoid doing good  being righteous and making peace between people god is all hearing and all knowing 
god will not call you to account for any oaths you uttered unintentionally  but he will take you to task for what is intended in your hearts god is most forgiving and forbearing 
for those who swear that they will not approach their wives  there shall be a waiting period of four months  if they revert to conciliation  surely  god is most forgiving and ever merciful 
but if they decide upon divorce  god is all hearing and all knowing 
divorced women should wait for three menstrual cycles  it is unlawful for them  if they believe in god and the last day  to hide what god has created in their wombs their husbands have the right to take them back within that time  if they desire to be reconciled the wives have rights corresponding to those which the husbands have  according to what is recognized to be fair  but men have a rank above them god is almighty and all wise 
divorce may be pronounced twice  and then a woman must be retained honourably or released with kindness it is not lawful for you to take away anything of what you have given your wives  unless both fear that they would not be able to observe the bounds set by god in such a case it shall be no sin for either of them if the woman opts to give something for her release these are the bounds set by god  do not transgress them those who transgress the bounds of god are wrongdoers 
and if man finally divorces his wife  he cannot remarry her until she has married another man then if the next husband divorces her  there will be no blame on either of them if the former husband and wife return to one another  provided they think that they can keep within the bounds set by god these are the bounds prescribed by god  which he makes clear to men of understanding 
once you divorce women  and they have reached the end of their waiting period  then either retain them in all decency or part from them decently do not retain them in order to harm them or to wrong them whoever does this  wrongs his own soul do not make a mockery of god s revelations remember the favours god has bestowed upon you  and the book and the wisdom he has revealed to exhort you fear god and know that god is aware of everything 
when you divorce women and they reach the end of their waiting period  do not prevent them from marrying other men  if they have come to an honourable agreement this is enjoined on every one of you who believes in god and the last day  it is more wholesome and purer for you god knows  but you do not know 
and the divorced mothers should nurse their children for two whole years  if they wish to complete the period of nursing  and during that period the father of the child shall be responsible for the maintenance of the mother in a reasonable manner no soul is charged with more than it can bear no mother should be made to suffer on account of her child  and no father should be made to suffer on account of his child the same duties devolve upon the father s heir in case of the death of the father but if  after consultation  they choose by mutual agreement to wean the child  there shall be no blame on them nor shall it be any offence for you if you desire to engage a wet nurse for your children  provided you hand over what you have agreed to pay  in a reasonable manner have fear of god and know that god is observant of all your actions 
if any of you die and leave widows  the widows should wait for four months and ten days when they have reached the end of their waiting period you will not be blamed for what they may reasonably choose to do with themselves  god is aware of what you do 
it shall be no offence for you to hint at a proposal of marriage to divorced or widowed women or to cherish them in your hearts god knows that you will bear them in mind but do not enter into any secret arrangement with them  beyond conveying some indication to them of your inclination do not proceed with tying the marriage knot before the end of their waiting period know that god has knowledge of all your thoughts therefore  take heed and bear in mind that god is forgiving and forbearing 
you will not be blamed for not paying the dower money if you divorce women when you have not yet consummated the marriage or fixed a dower money upon them  but make fair provision for them  the affluent according to his means and the straitened according to his means  this is binding on righteous men 
if you divorce them before the marriage is consummated  but after their dower money has been settled  give them the half of their dower money  unless they the women agree to forego it  or the man the husband in whose hand lies the marriage knot foregoes it to forego is nearer to righteousness do not neglect any chance of behaving benevolently towards each other god is observant of whatever you do 
be ever mindful of prayers  especially the middle prayer  and stand up before god in submissive devotion 
when you are exposed to danger  pray on foot or while riding  when you are safe again  remember god  for he has taught you what you did not know 
if any of you die and leave widows  make a bequest for them of a year s maintenance without causing them to leave their homes  but if they leave of their own accord  you will not be blamed for what they may reasonably choose to do with themselves god is almighty and wise 
for divorced women a provision according to what is fair shall also be made this is an obligation binding on the righteous 
thus god makes his commandments clear to you  so that you may understand 
have you not seen those who fled their homes in their thousands for fear of death  whereupon god said to them   die   and later brought them back to life surely god is bountiful to mankind  but most of them are ungrateful 
fight in defence in god s cause and remember that he is all hearing and all knowing 
who will give god a generous loan he will multiply it many times over it is god who withholds  and god who gives abundantly  and it is to him that you shall all be returned 
have you not heard of what the chiefs of the children of israel demanded of one of their prophets after moses they said   appoint for us a king  and we will fight for the cause of god   he replied   what if you refuse to fight  when ordered to do so    why should we not fight for the cause of god   they replied   when we have been driven forth from our homes and our children   but when at last they were commanded to fight  they all refused  except a few of them god knows the wrongdoers 
their prophet said to them   god has now appointed talut to be your king   but they replied   how can he be king over us when we are worthier of kingship than he and he has not even been granted an abundance of wealth   he said   god has chosen him over you  and has given him great knowledge and physique god grants kingship to whoever he pleases  god is magnanimous and all knowing  
their prophet also said to them   the sign of his kingship is that the ark of the covenant shall come to you therein shall be tranquillity from your lord  and the relics which the house of moses and the house of aaron left behind it will be borne by the angels there is a sign in this for you  if you believe  
when talut set out with his forces  he said to them   god will test you with a river  whoever drinks from it is not with me and whoever does not drink is with me there will  however  be no blame upon one who sips only a handful from it   but  except for a few of them  they all drank from it when he and those who believed along with him had crossed the river  they said   we have no strength today against goliath and his warriors   but those of them who believed that they would meet god replied   many a small group  by god s command has prevailed against a large group god is indeed with the steadfast  
when they met goliath and his warriors  they said   our lord  bestow patience upon us  make us stand firm  and help us against those who deny the truth  
and so by the command of god they defeated them david killed goliath  and god gave him kingship and wisdom  and imparted to him the knowledge of whatever he willed had it not been for god s repelling some people by means of others  the earth would have been filled with corruption but god is bountiful to his creatures 
these are the revelations of god which we recite to you in all truth  for you are truly one of the messengers 
of these messengers  we have given something additional among them there are some to whom god spoke directly and others he exalted in rank we gave jesus  son of mary clear signs  and strengthened him with the holy spirit had god pleased  those who succeeded them would not have fought against one another after the clear signs had come to them but they disagreed among themselves  some believed  while others did not yet had god willed  they would not have fought against one another  but god does whatever he wills 
believers  spend out of what we have given you  before the day comes when there will be neither trading  friendship nor intercession truly  it is those who deny the truth who are the wrongdoers 
god  there is no deity save him  the living  the eternal one neither slumber nor sleep overtakes him to him belong whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth who can intercede with him except by his permission he knows all that is before them and all that is behind them they can grasp only that part of his knowledge which he wills his throne extends over the heavens and the earth  and their upholding does not weary him he is the sublime  the almighty one 
there shall be no compulsion in religion  true guidance has become distinct from error but whoever refuses to be led by satan and believes in god has grasped the strong handhold that will never break god is all hearing and all knowing 
god is the patron of the faithful he leads them from darkness to the light as for those who deny the truth  their supporter is satan  who brings them out of light into darkness they are the heirs of the fire  and there they will remain forever 
have you not heard of him who argued with abraham about his lord because god had bestowed the kingdom upon him abraham said   my lord is the one who gives life and brings death   he answered   i too give life and bring death   abraham said   god brings up the sun from the east  so bring it up yourself from the west   then the disbeliever was confounded god does not guide the wrongdoers 
or of him who  when passing by a town the roofs of which had caved in  exclaimed   how will god restore it to life after its destruction   thereupon god caused him to die  and after a hundred years  brought him back to life god asked   how long have you remained in this state   he answered   i have remained a day or part of a day   god said   no  you have remained in this state for a hundred years now look at your food and your drink  they have not rotted look at your ass we will make you a sign to mankind look at the bones    how we set them together  then clothe them with flesh   when it had all become clear to him  he said   now i know that god has power over all things  
when abraham said   show me  my lord  how you revive the dead   god said   do you not believe   abraham answered   yes  indeed i do believe  but just to reassure my heart   then god said   take four birds  and train them to come back to you then place them separately on each hilltop  and call them  they will come flying to you know that god is almighty and wise  
those who spend their wealth for god s cause may be compared to a grain of corn which sprouts into seven ears  with a hundred grains in each ear  for god grants manifold increase to whom he wills  god is infinite and all knowing 
those who spend their wealth for god s cause and do not follow their almsgiving with taunts and insults shall be rewarded by their lord  they shall have no fear  nor shall they grieve 
a kind word and forgiveness is better than a charitable deed followed by hurtful words  god is self sufficient and forbearing 
believers  do not cancel out your charitable deeds with reminders and hurtful words  like one who spends his wealth only to be seen by people  and not believing in god and the last day such men are like a rock covered with earth  a shower falls upon it and leaves it hard and bare they will gain nothing from their works god does not guide those who deny the truth 
but those who spend their wealth in order to gain god s approval  and to strengthen their souls are like a garden on elevated ground when heavy rain falls on it  it doubles its produce  and if heavy rain does not fall  then light rain suffices god sees what you do 
would any of you  being a man well advanced in age with helpless children to support  like to have a garden of dates and grapes  watered by rivers and containing all kinds of fruits  stricken by a fiery whirlwind and utterly scorched thus god makes his signs clear to you  so that you may reflect 
believers  give charitably from the good things which you have earned and what we produce for you from the earth  not worthless things which you yourselves would only reluctantly accept know that god is self sufficient and praiseworthy 
satan threatens you with the prospect of poverty and commands you to do foul deeds but god promises his forgiveness and his bounty god is bountiful and all knowing 
he grants wisdom to whom he will  and whoever is granted wisdom has indeed been granted abundant wealth yet none bear this in mind except those endowed with understanding 
whatever you spend and whatever vows you make are known to god  but the wrongdoers shall have no helpers 
if you give charity openly  it is good  but if you keep it secret and give to the needy in private  that is better for you  and it will atone for some of your bad deeds god is aware of all that you do 
it is not your responsibility to make them follow the right path  god guides whomever he pleases whatever wealth you spend is to your own benefit  provided that you spend only to seek the favour of god whatever wealth you spend for god s cause shall be repaid to you in full and you shall not be wronged 
the needy  who are too engrossed in god s cause to be able to travel about the land in search of a livelihood  are considered by those who are unaware of their condition to be free from want  because they refrain from begging but they can be known from their appearance they do not make insistent demands upon people whatever wealth you spend  god knows it 
those who spend their wealth night and day  both privately and publicly  will receive their reward from their lord they shall have no fear  nor shall they grieve 
those who live on usury shall rise up before god like men whom satan has demented by his touch  for they say   buying and selling is only a kind of usury   but god has made trade lawful and made usury unlawful therefore  he who desists because of the admonition that has come to him from his lord may retain what he has received in the past  and it will be for god to judge him those who revert to it shall be the inmates of the fire  they shall abide therein forever 
god blights usury and blesses charitable deeds god does not love the ungrateful wrongdoer 
those who believe  do good deeds  attend to their prayers and engage in almsgiving  shall be rewarded by their lord and shall have no fear  nor shall they grieve 
believers  have fear of god  and give up what is still due to you from usury  if you are true believers 
for  if you do not do so  then know that you are at war with god and his messenger but if you repent  you may retain your capital do not wrong others and you will not be wronged 
if the debtor is in straitened circumstances  then grant him respite till a time of ease if you were to write it off as an act of charity  that would be better for you  if only you knew 
fear the day when you shall be made to return to god  then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned  and they shall not be wronged 
believers  when you contract a debt for a stated term  put it down in writing  have a scribe write it down with fairness between you no scribe should refuse to write  let him write as god has taught him  let the debtor dictate  and let him fear god  his lord  and not diminish the debt at all if the debtor is weak in mind or body  or unable to dictate  then in fairness let his guardian dictate for him call in two of your men as witnesses but if two men cannot be found  then call one man and two women out of those you approve of as witnesses  so that if one of the two women should forget the other can remind her let the witnesses not refuse when they are summoned do not be disinclined to write down your debts  be they small or large  together with the date of payment this is more just in the sight of god  it is more reliable as testimony  and more likely to prevent doubts arising between you  unless it be ready merchandise which you give or take from hand to hand  then it will not be held against you for not writing it down have witnesses present whenever you trade with one another  and let no harm be done to either scribe or witness  for if you did cause them harm  it would be a crime on your part be mindful of god  he teaches you  he has full knowledge of everything 
if you are on a journey and do not find any literate person  something should be handed over as security if one of you entrusts another with something  let the trustee restore the pledge to its owner  and let him fear god  his lord do not conceal testimony if someone does conceal it  in his heart he commits a crime god knows what you do 
all that the heavens and the earth contain belongs to god  whether you disclose what is in your minds or keep it hidden god will bring you to account for it he will forgive whom he will and punish whom he pleases  he has power over all things 
the messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his lord  and so do believers they all believe in god and his angels  his scriptures  and his messengers they say   we do not differentiate between any of his messengers we hear and obey grant us your forgiveness  lord  to you we shall all return  
god does not charge a soul with more than it can bear it shall be requited for whatever good and whatever evil it has done they pray    our lord  do not take us to task if we forget or make a mistake  our lord  do not place on us a burden like the one you placed on those before us  our lord  do not place on us a burden we have not the strength to bear  pardon us  and forgive us  and have mercy on us you are our lord and sustainer  so help us against those who deny the truth  
alif lam mim 
god  there is no deity save him  the living  the sustainer 
he has sent down the book to you with truth  which fulfils the predictions in the scriptures that preceded it  he sent down the torah and the gospel
in the past as guidance for mankind  he has also sent down the standard by which to discern the true from the false surely those who deny god s signs will suffer severe punishment god is mighty and capable of retribution 
nothing on earth or in the heavens is hidden from god 
it is he who shapes you in the womb as he will there is no deity save him  the mighty  the wise one 
it is he who has sent down the book to you some of its verses are clear and precise in meaning  they are the basis of the book  while others are allegorical those with deviation in their hearts pursue the allegorical  so as to create dissension by seeking to explain it  but no one knows its meaning except god those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say   we believe in it  it is all from our lord   but only the wise take heed 
our lord  do not let our hearts deviate after you have guided us bestow upon us your mercy surely you are a munificent giver 
our lord  you will surely gather all mankind on the day of whose coming there is no doubt god never fails to fulfill his promise  
as for those who deny the truth  their wealth and children will not help them against god they will be fuel for the fire 
their end will be like pharaoh s people and those before them  they denied our signs  so god seized them in their sinfulness  god is stern in punishment 
say to those who deny the truth   you shall be overcome and driven into hell    an evil resting place  
there was a sign for you in the two groups which met face to face at badr   one party fighting for the cause of god and the other made up of those who deny the truth the faithful saw with their own eyes that the others were twice their number  but god strengthens with his succour whom he wills in this  there is indeed a lesson for all who have eyes to see 
the satisfaction of worldly desires through women  and children  and heaped up treasures of gold and silver  and pedigreed horses  and cattle and lands is attractive to people all this is the provision of the worldly life  but the most excellent abode is with god 
say   shall i tell you of something better than all of these for the god fearing  there are gardens in nearness to their god with rivers flowing through them where they shall live forever with pure spouses and the goodwill of god god is watching his servants   
those who say   lord  we believe in you  forgive us our sins and keep us from the punishment of the fire  
those who are steadfast  truthful  obedient  and those who spend for god s cause and who pray before dawn for forgiveness  
god bears witness that there is no deity save him  as do the angels and those who possess knowledge he is the upholder of justice there is no diety save him  the mighty  the wise one 
the only true religion in god s sight is complete submission to god and those who were given the book disagreed only out of rivalry  after knowledge had been given to them    he who denies god s signs should know that god is swift in his reckoning 
if they dispute with you  say   i have submitted my whole being to god and so have those who follow me   and ask those who have been given the book  as well as the unlettered   do you submit yourselves to god in the same way   if they submit themselves to him  they are on the right path  but if they turn away  your duty is only to convey the message god is observant of all his servants 
those who deny god s signs and kill the prophets unjustly and kill those who enjoin justice  give them warning of a woeful punishment 
their deeds will come to nothing in this world as well as in the hereafter  they will have no supporters 
have you not seen those who received a portion of the book when they are invited to accept the judgement of god s book  a group of them turns away in aversion 
that is because they say   the fire will touch us only for a limited number of days   thus the false beliefs which they have invented have deluded them in the matter of their religion 
how will it be when we gather them all together upon a day which is sure to come  when every human being shall be repaid in full for what he has done they will not be wronged 
say   lord  sovereign of all sovereignty you bestow sovereignty on whom you will and take it away from whom you please  you exalt whoever you will and abase whoever you will all that is good lies in your hands you have the power to will anything 
you cause the night to pass into the day  and the day into the night  you bring forth the living from the lifeless and the lifeless from the living you give without measure to whom you will  
let not the believers take those who deny the truth for their allies in preference to the believers  anyone who does that will isolate himself completely from god  unless it be to protect yourselves against them in this way god admonishes you to fear him  for  to god shall all return 
say   god knows everything that is in your heart  whether you conceal it or reveal it  he knows everything that the heavens and earth contain  god has power over all things  
on the day when every human being will find himself faced with all the good that he has done  and with all the evil that he has done  many will wish that there were a long space of time between himself and that day god admonishes you to fear him  but god is compassionate towards his servants 
say   if you love god  follow me and god will love you and forgive you your sins god is most forgiving  and most merciful  
say   obey god and the messenger   and if they turn away  god does not love those who deny the truth 
god chose adam and noah and the family of abraham and the family of imran above all his creatures 
they are the offspring of one another god hears all and knows all 
remember when the wife of imran said   my lord  i have dedicated what is in my womb entirely to your service so accept this from me you are the one who hears and knows all  
when she gave birth  she said   my lord  i have given birth to a girl   god knew very well what she had given birth to  a male is not like a female   i have named her mary and placed her and her children in your protection from the rejected satan  
her lord graciously accepted her and made her grow in goodness and entrusted her to the care of zachariah every time zachariah visited her in her chamber he found some provision with her he asked   mary  where did this provision come from   she replied   this is from god god provides for whoever he wills without measure  
thereupon zachariah prayed to his lord  saying   lord  grant me by your own grace virtuous offspring you are the hearer of all prayers  
as he stood praying in the chamber  the angels called out to him  saying   god gives you the good news of john  who shall confirm the word from god  and shall be outstanding among men  and utterly chaste  and a prophet from among the righteous  
lord  said zachariah   how shall i have a son when i am now overtaken by old age and my wife is barren    such is the will of god   replied the angel    he does what he pleases  
he said   my lord  grant me a sign   the angel said   your sign is that you will not be able to speak to people for three days except by signs remember your lord much and glorify him morning and evening  
the angels said   mary  god has selected you and purified you he has selected you over all the women of your time 
o mary  remain truly devout to your sustainer  and prostrate yourself in worship  and bow down with those who bow down before him  
this is an account of the unseen  which we reveal to you you were not with them when they drew lots as to which of them should be mary s guardian and you were not with them when they disputed with one another 
when the angels said   o mary  your lord gives you good news of a word from him his name is the messiah  jesus  son of mary  honoured in this world and in the next and one of those who are granted nearness to god 
and he shall speak to men in his cradle  and as a grown man  and shall be one of the righteous  
lord  she said   how can i have a child when no man has touched me   the angel replied   thus it is  god creates what he wills  when he wills a thing he need only say   be   and it is 
god will instruct him in the book and in wisdom and in the torah and in the gospel 
he will make him a messenger to the children of israel he will say   i have come to you with a sign from your lord i will make the shape of a bird out of clay for you and then breathe into it and  by god s leave  it will become a living bird and by god s leave i will heal the blind and the leper and bring the dead to life i will tell you what you eat and what you store up in your homes surely in this there is a sign for you  if you are believers 
i come to fulfill the prediction of the torah which preceded me and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you and i come to you with a sign from your lord so fear god and obey me 
god is my lord and your lord  so worship him that is the straight path  
when jesus perceived their denial  he said   who will be my helpers in god s cause   the disciples said   we are god s helpers  we believe in god bear witness that we have surrendered ourselves 
our lord  we believe in what you have sent down and we follow the messenger  so count us among those who bear witness  
and they schemed but god also schemed and god is the best of schemers 
god said   o jesus  i shall take you to me and will raise you up to me and shall clear you of the calumnies of the disbelievers  and shall place those who follow you above those who deny the truth  until the day of judgement  then to me shall all return and i will judge between you regarding your disputes 
those who deny the truth shall be sternly punished in this world and in the world to come  there shall be none to help them  
as for those who have believed and do good works  they shall be given their reward in full god does not love evil doers 
this which we recite to you is a revelation and a wise reminder 
jesus in the sight of god is like adam he created him from dust  then said to him   be   and he was 
this is the truth from your lord  so do not be among the doubters 
and if anyone should argue with you about this truth after the knowledge you have received  say to them   come  let us gather our sons and your sons  our women and your women  and ourselves and yourselves  and then let us pray earnestly and invoke the curse of god upon the liars 
this is the true account there is no deity save him god is mighty and wise  
and if they turn away  god knows well the evil doers 
say   people of the book  let us come to a word common to us that we shall worship none but god and that we shall associate no partner with him and that none of us shall take others  besides god  for lords   and if they turn away  say   bear witness that we have submitted to god  
people of the book  why do you dispute about abraham when the torah and gospel were only sent down after him do you not use your reason 
you are those who disputed about things of which you had some knowledge must you now argue about things of which you have no knowledge god knows  but you do not know 
abraham was neither a jew nor a christian he was an upright man  one who had surrendered himself to god he was not one of those who associate partners with god 
surely  the people who are closest to abraham are those who followed him and this prophet muhammad   and those who believe in him god is the guardian of the believers 
some of the people of the book wish to lead you astray but they only lead themselves astray  though they do not realise it 
people of the book  why do you deny god s signs  having been witnesses thereof 
people of the book  why do you mix truth with falsehood and knowingly conceal the truth 
some of the people of the book say to one another   believe in what is revealed to the faithful in the morning and deny it in the evening  so that they the muslims may themselves abandon their faith in confusion 
believe only in those who follow your own religion   say to them   surely  the true guidance is the guidance from god   but you think it is impossible that someone else may be granted revelation such as you were granted    or else that they should contend against you before your lord say   all grace is in the hands of god  he grants it to whom he wills  for god is boundless  and all knowing 
he singles out for his mercy whoever he pleases god is the lord of exceeding bounty  
among the people of the book there are some who  if you entrust them with a heap of gold  will return it to you but there are others of them who  if you entrust them with a single dinar  will not return it to you  unless you keep demanding it from them that is because they say   we are under no obligation towards the gentiles   they deliberately tell lies about god 
indeed god loves those who honour their covenants and fear him god loves the righteous 
those who sell out god s covenant and their oaths for a paltry price will have no share in the life to come on the day of resurrection god will neither speak to them nor cast a look upon them on the day of judgement  nor will he purify them for them there shall be a grievous punishment 
there are some among them who distort the book by the way they speak to make you think that what they say is from the book  whereas it is not they say it is from god whereas it is not thus they tell a lie about god and they know it 
no one to whom god has given the scriptures and on whom he has bestowed wisdom and prophethood would say to men   worship me instead of god   he would say rather    be devoted servants of god  for you have taught and studied the scriptures  
nor would he enjoin you to take the angels and the prophets as your lords  how could he command you to be disbelievers after you have submitted to god 
when god made a covenant with the prophets  he said   here is the book and the wisdom which i have given you when there comes to you a messenger fulfilling that predictions about him in their scripture which is with you  you must believe in him and help him do you then affirm this and accept the responsibility i have laid upon you in these terms   they said   we will affirm it   god said   then bear witness  and i will bear witness with you  
now whoever turns away after this  are surely transgressors 
do they seek a religion other than the religion of god  when everything in the heavens and the earth has submitted to him  willingly or unwillingly to him they shall all return 
say   we believe in god and in what has been sent down to us and to abraham  ishmael  isaac  jacob and the tribes we believe in what has been given to moses  jesus and the prophets from their lord we make no distinction between any of them it is to him that we have surrendered ourselves  
if anyone seeks a religion other than islam submission to god   it will not be accepted from him  he will be among the losers in the hereafter 
how would god bestow his guidance upon people who have opted for unbelief after having embraced the faith and having borne witness that this messenger is true and after all evidence of the truth has come to them for  god does not guide such wrongdoers 
such people will be rewarded with rejection by god  by the angels  by all mankind 
in this state they shall abide forever  their punishment shall not be lightened nor shall they be granted respite 
except for those who afterwards repent and reform god is forgiving and merciful 
but as for those who are bent on denying the truth after accepting the true faith and grow in their refusal to acknowledge the truth  their repentance will not be accepted they are the ones who have gone far astray 
those who reject faith and die in the state of rejection will not be saved  even if they offer as ransom enough gold to fill the entire earth painful punishment is in store for them and they will have no supporters 
never will you attain to righteousness unless you spend for the cause of god out of what you cherish  and whatever you spend is known to god 
all food was lawful for the children of israel  except whatever israel had made unlawful for himself before the torah was sent down say to them   bring the torah then and read it  if you are truthful 
those who  after this  persist in making up lies and attributing them to god are transgressors  
say   god speaks the truth  so follow the faith of abraham he was an upright man and he was not one of the polytheists  
the first house to be built for mankind was the one at bakkah makkah it is a blessed place  a source of guidance for the whole world 
there are clear signs in it  it is the place where abraham stood anyone who enters it will be secure pilgrimage to the house is a duty to god for anyone who is able to undertake it anyone who disbelieves should remember that god is independent of all creatures 
say   people of the book  why do you reject god s revelations when god is witness to all that you do  
say   people of the book  why do you turn the believers away from the path of god  seeking to make it crooked  while you are witnesses thereof god is not unaware of what you do  
o believers  if you yield to some of those who were given the scripture  they will cause you to renounce the truth after you have believed 
but how can you deny the truth when god s revelations are being conveyed to you and his own messenger is in your midst he who holds fast to god is indeed guided to the straight path 
believers  fear god as is his due  and when death comes  be in a state of complete submission to him 
hold fast to the cord of god and let nothing divide you remember the blessings he has bestowed upon you  you were enemies and then he united your hearts and by his grace you became brothers  you were on the brink of an abyss of fire and he rescued you from it thus god makes his signs clear to you  so that you may find guidance 
let there be a group among you who call others to good  and enjoin what is right  and forbid what is wrong  those who do this shall be successful 
do not be like those who  after they had been given clear evidence  split into factions and differed among themselves  a terrible punishment awaits such people 
on the day when some faces are bright and some faces are dark  it will be said to those with darkened faces   did you reject faith after accepting it taste  then  this punishment for having denied the truth  
but as for those with shining faces  they shall abide forever in god s grace 
these are god s revelations  we recite them to you in all truth god desires no injustice to mankind 
his is all that the heavens and the earth contain to god shall all things return 
you are indeed the best community that has ever been brought forth for the good of mankind you enjoin what is good  and forbid what is evil  and you believe in god if the people of the book had also believed  it would have surely been better for them some of them are true believers  but most of them are disobedient 
they can do you very little harm  if they come out to fight you  they will show you their backs  then they shall not be helped   
abasement shall attend them wherever they are found  unless they make a covenant with god or with man they have incurred god s wrath and have been utterly humbled  because they have persistently disbelieved in god s signs and killed prophets unjustly this resulted from their disobedience and their habit of transgression 
yet they are not all alike of the people of the book there are some who stand by their covenant  they recite the word of god during the night and prostrate themselves before him 
who believe in god and the last day  who enjoin justice and forbid evil and vie with each other in good works these are righteous men
and they will not be denied the reward for whatever good deeds they do  god knows the righteous 
as for those who deny the truth  neither their possessions nor their children shall avail them in the least against god they will be inmates of the fire they will remain there for ever 
that which they spend in pursuit of the life of this world is like a biting frosty blast which smites the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves  and destroys it god is not unjust to them  they are unjust to their own souls 
believers  do not take outsiders as your intimate friends  they will spare no effort to harm you they love to see you suffer  their hatred is evident from the words which fall from their mouths but what their hearts conceal is far worse we have made our signs clear to you  will you not understand 
it is you who love them  but they do not love you  you believe in all the revealed books when they meet you  they say   we believe   but when they are alone  they bite their fingertips with rage say   die of rage   god is aware of what your hearts contain 
whenever something good happens to you  it grieves them  but when evil befalls you  they rejoice if you persevere and fear god  their designs will never harm you in the least  god encompasses all that they do 
when you set out at dawn from your home to assign battle positions to the believers    god hears all and knows all 
when two groups from among you were about to lose heart  god was their protector in god let the faithful put their trust 
god had already helped you at badr  when you were weak fear god  so that you may be grateful 
 and remember when you said to the believers   does it not suffice that your lord helps you by sending down three thousand angels 
if you remain patient and god fearing  and the enemy should fall upon you all of a sudden  your lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels clearly marked  
and god ordained this only as good news for you so that your hearts might be comforted  help comes only from god  the powerful  the wise one 
and so that he might cut off a portion of those who are bent on denying the truth or abase them so that they might be turned back frustrated 
you have no say in this affair to decide whether he will relent towards them or he will punish them  they are wrongdoers 
whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth belong to god he forgives whoever he pleases and punishes whoever he pleases god is most forgiving and ever merciful 
believers  do not devour usury multiplied many times over fear god  so that you may prosper 
guard yourself against the fire prepared for those who deny the truth 
and obey god and the messenger  so that you may be given mercy 
and vie with one another for your lord s forgiveness and for a paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth  which has been prepared for the god fearing 
for those who spend  both in prosperity and adversity  who restrain their anger and are forgiving towards their fellow men    god loves those who do good works 
and who  when they have committed an indecency or have wronged their souls  remember god and pray that their sins be forgiven  for who but god can forgive sins   and do not knowingly persist in their misdeeds 
their recompense is forgiveness from their lord  and gardens with rivers flowing through them  where they will abide forever how excellent will be the reward of those who do good works 
there are many examples of the communities that have passed away before you  travel through the land  and see what was the end of those who rejected the truth 
this quran is an exposition for the people and a guidance and admonition for those who fear god 
and do not become faint of heart  nor grieve  you will have the upper hand  if you are believers 
if you have suffered a wound  they too have suffered a similar wound we bring these days to men by turns  so that god may know those who believe  and choose witnesses from among you  and god does not love the unjust 
so that god may purge those who believe and wipe out those who deny the truth 
do you suppose that you would enter the garden  without god knowing those among you who would strive hard for his cause and endure with fortitude 
you were longing for death  before you met it now you have seen it with your own eyes 
muhammad is only a messenger messengers have passed away before him if he should die  or be killed  will you turn back on your heels those who turn on their heels do not harm the lord in the least god will reward the grateful 
no soul shall die except with god s permission and at an appointed time and if one desires the rewards of this world  we shall grant it to him  and if one desires the rewards of the life to come  we shall grant it to him we will reward the grateful 
how many a prophet has fought with many devout men alongside him  they did not lose heart  despite all that they had to suffer in god s path they neither weakened nor yielded god loves the patient 
all they said was   our lord  forgive us our sins and our excesses make our feet firm  and help us against those who deny the truth  
and so god gave them both the rewards of this life and the excellent recompense of the life to come  god loves those who do good 
believers  if you yield to those who deny the truth  they will cause you to turn back on your heels and you will turn into losers 
no  indeed  it is god who is your protector  he is the best supporter 
we will strike awe into the hearts of those who deny the truth  because they have associated partners with god  for which he has sent down no authority their abode shall be the fire  and evil indeed is the abode of the wrongdoers 
and god made good his promise to you when by his leave you were about to destroy your foes  but then your courage failed you and you disagreed among yourselves concerning the prophet s direction and disobeyed it  after he had brought you within sight of what you wished for  some of you desired the goods of this world and some of you desired the hereafter  then in order that he might put you to the test  he prevented you from defeating your foes but now he has pardoned you  god is most gracious to the believers 
when you were running away and did not look back at anyone  while the messenger was calling to you from behind  he paid you back with one sorrow after another  so that you might not grieve for what you lost  nor for what befell you god is aware of what you do 
then  after sorrow he sent down peace of mind upon you in the shape of drowsiness that overcame some of you  but there were others who were anxious only about themselves they entertained false notions about god  like the notions of the days of ignorance  have we any say in the matter   they asked say to them   all is in the hands of god   they conceal in their hearts what they would not reveal to you they say   had we had any say in the matter  none of us would have been killed here   say to them   had you stayed in your homes  those whose death had been decreed would nevertheless have gone forth to the places where they were destined to die   and all this befell you so that god might test what is in your minds and in order to purify what was in your hearts for god is aware of your innermost thoughts 
those of you who turned away on the day the two hosts met in battle were made to slip by satan on account of some of their deeds but god has pardoned them  god is forgiving and forbearing 
believers  do not be like those who are bent on denying the truth and who say of their brothers  when they travel about the land or go forth to war   had they but remained with us  they would not have died  or been slain     for god will cause such thoughts to become a source of bitter regret in their hearts  since it is god who gives life and causes death and god sees all that you do 
if you are killed or die in god s cause  then surely forgiveness from god and his grace are better than all that one could amass 
for  indeed  if you die or are killed  it is to god that you shall be gathered 
it is by god s grace that you were gentle with them    for if you had been harsh and hard hearted  they would surely have deserted you    so bear with them and pray for forgiveness for them take counsel with them in the conduct of affairs  then  when you have decided upon a course of action  place your trust in god  for god loves those who place their trust in him 
if god helps you  none can overcome you  but if he withdraws his help from you  who is there who can help you besides him in god  then  let the believers place their trust 
it is not for any prophet to hold back anything  he who hides anything away shall bring it forth on the day of resurrection  when every human being shall be repaid in full for whatever he has done  and none shall be wronged 
can one who seeks the pleasure of god  be like one who incurs the wrath of god and whose abode shall be hell    an evil destination 
all have a different standing in the eyes of god  and god is observant of all their actions 
indeed  god has conferred a great favour on the believers in sending a messenger from among themselves  to recite his revelations to them  and purify them  and teaches them the book and wisdom  for  before that they were surely in manifest error 
what  when a misfortune befalls you  after you had yourself inflicted twice as heavy losses  you say   how has this come about   say   it was your own fault   truly  god has the power to will anything 
the misfortune which befell you on the day when the two armies met happened by god s leave  so that he might mark out the true believers
and know those who acted hypocritically   when they were told   come  fight in god s cause and defend yourselves   they replied   if we knew that fighting would take place  we would surely follow you   they were that day nearer to unbelief than to belief the words they utter bear no relation to what is in their hearts god knows well what they conceal 
those who stayed behind  said of their brothers   had they listened to us  they would not have been killed   say to them   ward off death from yourselves  then  if what you say be true  
do not think of those who have been killed in god s cause as dead they are alive  and well provided for by their lord 
they are joyful because of what god has bestowed on them of his grace and they rejoice that those they left behind  who have not yet joined them  that they shall have no fear  nor shall they grieve 
rejoicing in god s grace and bounty they know that god will not fail to requite the believers 
those who responded to the call of god and the messenger  despite their having received an injury  and such of them as did good deeds and feared god  shall have a great reward 
those who  on being told that   the enemy has gathered against you a great force  so fear them   only grew stronger in their faith and replied   god is sufficient for us he is the best guardian  
they returned home with god s favour and blessings  without having been touched by evil  for they pursued god s pleasure and god s bounty is infinite 
it is satan who instills fear into you of his followers  do not fear them but fear me  if you are true believers 
and let not those grieve you who vie with one another in denying the truth  they cannot harm god in the least  it is god s will that they will have no share in the life to come    a severe punishment awaits them 
those who have bought a denial of truth at the price of faith can in no way harm god  painful punishment awaits them 
let not those who deny the truth think that our granting them respite is good for them  our granting them respite will only cause them to increase in disobedience    shameful punishment awaits them 
on no account will god leave the believers in the condition in which they are now  until he separates the evil from the good nor will god reveal to you the unseen but god chooses those of his messengers whom he will therefore  believe in god and his messengers  for if you have faith and guard yourselves against evil  you shall have a great reward 
let not those who are niggardly with what god has granted them out of his bounty think that it is good for them indeed  it is evil for them what they are niggardly about shall be hung about their necks like a collar on the day of resurrection it is god who will inherit the heavens and the earth  god is aware of all that you do 
god has indeed heard the words of those who said   behold  god is poor while we are rich   we shall record what they have said  and their slaying of the prophets unjustly  and we shall say   taste the torment of burning 
in return for what your own hands have wrought    for never does god do the least wrong to his creatures  
to those who say   god has commanded us not to believe in any messenger unless he brings down to us an offering to be consumed by fire   say   messengers before me have come to you with clear signs  including the one you demand why did you kill them  if you are telling the truth  
if they deny you  so have other messengers been denied before you  who came with clear signs  scriptures and enlightening book 
every human being is bound to taste death  and you shall receive your rewards in full on the day of resurrection he who is kept away from the fire and is admitted to paradise  will surely triumph  for the life of this world is nothing but an illusory enjoyment 
you will surely be tried and tested in your possessions and your persons  and you shall surely hear many hurtful things from those who were given the book before you and from those who set up partners with god  but if you endure with fortitude and restrain yourselves  that indeed is a matter of strong determination 
god made a covenant with those who were given the book to make it known to people and not conceal it but they cast it behind their backs and bartered it for a paltry price  what an evil bargain they made 
those who exult in their misdeeds and love to be praised for what they have not done should not suppose that they are secure from punishment  they shall suffer a grievous punishment 
the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to god  god has power over all things 
there are signs in the creation of the heavens and the earth  and in the alternation of night and day for people of understanding 
who remember god while standing  sitting and lying on their sides  and who ponder over the creation of the heavens and the earth  saying   lord  you have not created all this without purpose glory be to you  save us from the torment of the fire 
lord  those whom you condemn to enter the fire you have surely brought to disgrace wrongdoers will have no supporters 
lord  we have heard a caller calling to the true faith saying   believe in your lord   and we believed lord  forgive us our sins and remove from us our bad deeds and make us die with the virtuous 
our lord  grant us what you have promised to us through your messengers  and do not humiliate us on the day of resurrection surely  you never fail to fulfill your promise  
their lord accepted their prayer  saying   i will deny no man or woman among you the reward of their labours you are members one of another i will certainly forgive the sins of those who emigrated and were expelled from their homes  who suffered persecution in my cause  who fought and were killed i will certainly admit them to gardens through which rivers flow  as a reward from god  with god is the best reward  
do not be deceived by the actions of those who deny the truth in the land 
this is only a brief enjoyment  after which hell shall be their abode    what an evil resting place 
those who fear their lord shall have gardens through which rivers flow  wherein they will abide forever  and a goodly welcome from their lord god s recompense is best for the virtuous 
some of the people of the book believe in god  and in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to them they humble themselves before god and do not sell god s revelations for a trifling price these shall be rewarded by their lord  god is swift in reckoning 
believers  endure  vie with each other in endurance  stand firm in your faith and fear god  so that you may succeed 
o mankind  fear your lord  who created you from a single soul he created its mate from it and from the two of them spread countless men and women throughout the earth fear god  in whose name you appeal to one another  and be mindful of your obligations in respect of ties of kinship god is always watching over you 
give the orphans the possessions that belong to them  do not exchange good things with bad and do not consume their property  adding it to your own surely  this is a great crime 
if you fear that you cannot deal fairly with orphan girls  you may marry women of your choice  two or three or four  but if you fear that you might not be able to treat them with equal fairness  then only one    or from among those whom you rightfully possess that is more likely to keep you from committing an injustice 
and give the women their dowers willingly  but if they  of their own accord  remit any part of it to you  you may make use of it with pleasure and goodwill 
do not give those who are of immature mind your property which god has granted you as a means of support  make provision for them out of it  and clothe them  and give them good advice 
keep a close check on orphans till they attain the age of marriage  then  if you find them to be mature of mind  hand over their property to them do not consume it by wasteful spending  before they come of age if the guardian is affluent  let him abstain altogether  and if he is poor  let him have for himself what is just and reasonable when you hand over their property to them  call witnesses in their presence  god is sufficient as a reckoner 
men shall have a share in what parents and relatives leave behind  and women shall have a share in what parents and relatives leave behind  whether it be little or much this is ordained by god 
if other relatives  orphans or needy people are present at the time of the division  then provide for them out of it  and speak kindly to them 
those who are concerned about the fate of their own helpless children if they should die and leave them behind should show the same concern for orphans let them fear god and uphold justice 
those who consume the property of orphans unjustly are actually swallowing fire into their own bellies  soon they will burn in the blazing flame 
concerning your children  god enjoins you that a male shall receive a share equivalent to that of two females but if there are more than two females  then their share is two thirds of the inheritance if there is only one  she will receive the half each of your parents receives a sixth of what you leave if you have children if you are childless and your heirs are your parents  your mother receives a third if you have brothers or sisters your mother receives a sixth  after the deduction of any bequest you make or the repayment of any debts with regard to your father and your sons you do not know which of them is going to benefit you more  but this fixing of portions is by god and he is all knowing and all wise 
you will inherit half of what your wives leave  provided they have left no children but if they leave children then you inherit a quarter of what they leave  after payment of any bequests they may have made or any debts they may have incurred your wives shall inherit one quarter of what you leave if you are childless but if you leave children  your wives shall inherit one eighth  after payment of any bequest or debts if a man or woman has no direct heirs neither children or parents but has left a brother or a sister  they shall each inherit one sixth  but if they are more than two  they share one third between them  after payment of any bequests or debts  so that no harm is done to anyone that is a commandment from god  god is all knowing and forbearing 
these are the limits set by god anyone who obeys god and his messenger will be admitted to gardens through which rivers flow  to live there forever that will be the supreme achievement 
but anyone who disobeys god and his messenger and transgresses his limits shall be cast into a fire  wherein he will abide forever and he shall have a humiliating punishment 
if any of your women commit fornication  call in four male witnesses from among yourselves against them  if they testify to their guilt  confine them to the house until death releases them or until god gives them another way out 
if two men commit a like abomination  punish them both if they repent and mend their ways  leave them alone god is forgiving and merciful 
but god undertakes to accept repentance only from those who do evil out of ignorance and those who repent soon after god turns towards such people with mercy  he is all knowing and all wise 
forgiveness is not for those who continue to do evil deeds until  when death comes upon one of them  he says   now i repent   nor from those who die as deniers of the truth we have prepared a painful punishment for them 
believers  it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will  nor should you detain them wrongfully  so that you may take away a part of what you have given them  unless they are guilty of something clearly outrageous live with them in accordance with what is fair and kind  if you dislike them  it may be that you dislike something which god might make a source of abundant good 
if you desire to replace one wife with another  do not take any part of her dower back  even if you have given her a treasure would you take it by slandering her and with manifest sinfulness 
how can you take it when you have been intimate with one another  and she has taken a solemn pledge from you 
do not marry women whom your fathers married  except for what has already taken place in the past this is indeed a shameful deed  a loathsome thing and an evil practice 
you are forbidden to take as wives your mothers  daughters  sisters  paternal and maternal aunts  your brothers daughters and your sisters daughters  your foster mothers and foster sisters  your wives mothers and stepdaughters in your protection and the daughters of your wives with whom you have consummated your marriage  but if you have not consummated your marriage then you will not be blamed if you marry their daughters you are also forbidden to marry the spouses of your sons or two sisters together  except what has already passed surely  god is ever forgiving and merciful 
also forbidden are married women  except those who have passed into your hands as prisoners of war this is a commandment of god to you all women other than these are lawful to you  provided you seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock  not in fornication when you consummate your marriage with them  give the dowers due to them and there is no sin for you in what you do by mutual agreement after the fixing of the dower god is all knowing and wise 
if any of you cannot afford to marry a free believing woman let him marry one of his believing maids whom he possesses god best knows your faith you are one of another so marry them with their owner s permission  and give them their dower according to what is fair  neither committing fornication nor taking secret paramours and if  after they are married  they commit adultery they shall have half the punishment prescribed for a free woman this is for those of you who fear lest he should fall into sin but that it is better for you to practise self restraint god is most forgiving and merciful 
god wishes to explain things to you and guide you to the ways of those who have gone before you and to turn to you in mercy god is all knowing and all wise 
he wishes to turn towards you in mercy  but those who follow their own passions want you to drift far away from the right path 
god wishes to lighten your burdens  for  man has been created weak 
believers  do not wrongfully consume each other s wealth  but trade with it by mutual consent do not kill one another  for god is most merciful to you 
if anyone does these things through transgression and injustice  we shall cast him into the fire  and that is easy for god 
if you shun the great sins you have been forbidden  we shall cancel out your minor misdeeds and admit you to a place of honour 
do not covet the bounties which god has bestowed more abundantly on some of you than on others men shall be rewarded according to their deeds  and women shall be rewarded according to their deeds you should rather ask god for his bounty god has knowledge of all things 
we have appointed heirs for everything that parents and close relatives leave behind as for those with whom you have entered into agreements  let them  too  have their due god is witness to all things 
men are protectors of women  because god has made some of them excel others and because they spend their wealth on them so virtuous women are obedient and guard in the husband s absence what god would have them guard as for those from whom you apprehend infidelity  admonish them  then refuse to share their beds  and finally hit them lightly then if they obey you  take no further action against them for god is high  great 
if you fear any breach between a man and his wife  appoint one arbiter from his family and one arbiter from her family if they both want to set things right  god will bring about a reconciliation between them  he is all knowing and all aware 
worship god  and do not associate partners with him be good to your parents  to relatives  to orphans  to the needy  and the neighbour who is a kinsman  and the neighbour who is not related to you and your companions and the wayfarers and those whom you rightfully possess god does not like arrogant  boastful people 
who are miserly and enjoin others to be the same and conceal the riches which god has given them of his bounty we have prepared a humiliating punishment for those who deny the truth 
and god does not like those who spend their wealth for the sake of ostentation  who do not believe in god or the last day whoever has satan as his companion has an evil companion 
what harm could befall them if they believed in god and the last day  and spent out of what god bestowed on them god knows them well 
god does not wrong anyone by as much as a grain s weight if there be a good deed  he will repay twofold  and will bestow out of his own bounty an immense reward 
what will they do when we bring a witness from each community and bring you as a witness against these people 
on that day  those who were bent on denying the truth and disobeyed the messenger will wish that the earth were made level above them they will not be able to hide anything from god 
believers  do not approach your prayers when you are drunk  until you understand what you say  nor when you are in a state of impurity     except when you are on a journey    till you have bathed and if you are ill  or on a journey or have relieved yourselves or when you have consorted with women and you cannot find any water  then find some clean sand and wipe your face and your hands with it god is gracious and forgiving 
do you not know of those who were in possession of a portion of the book they buy up error and want you to lose your way 
god is quite aware as to who your enemies are  god suffices as a patron  and god suffices as a supporter 
some jews take words out of their context and say   we have heard  but we disobey   or  hear without listening   and they say  look at us   twisting the phrase with their tongues so as to disparage religion but if they had said   we hear and we obey   and  listen to us and look at us with favour   that would have been better and more proper for them god has rejected them for their defiance so that they shall not believe  except a few of them 
o people of the book  believe in what we have sent down  fulfilling the predictions that is with you  before we destroy your sense of direction  so as to confound or reject you  as we rejected those who broke the sabbath  god s command is always carried out 
god will not forgive anyone for associating something with him  while he will forgive whoever he wishes for anything besides that whoever ascribes partners to god is guilty of a monstrous sin 
have you not seen those who consider themselves pure it is indeed god who purifies whoever he pleases and none shall be wronged by as much as a hair s breadth 
see how they attribute their own lying inventions to god this is in itself a flagrant sin 
have you not seen those who were in possession of a portion of the book they believe in idols and devils they say of those who deny the truth   they are more rightly guided than the believers  
those are the ones god has rejected  you will not find anyone to help those god has rejected 
have they a share in god s kingdom if they did  they would not give others so much as the groove of a date stone 
do they envy others because of what god has given them out of his bounty we granted the house of abraham the book and wisdom and we granted them a great kingdom 
some of them believed in it and some held back from it hell will suffice as a blazing fire 
we shall send those who reject our revelations to the fire when their skins are burnt up  we shall replace them with new ones so that they may continue to taste the punishment god is mighty and wise 
as for those who believe and do good works  we shall make them enter gardens through which rivers flow  to dwell therein forever  therein they shall have pure spouses  and we shall admit them into a dense shade 
god commands you to hand back your trusts to their rightful owners  and when you judge between people  to judge with fairness god s instructions to you are excellent god hears and sees all things 
believers  obey god and obey the messenger and those who have been entrusted with authority among you if you are in dispute over any matter  refer it to god and the messenger  if you truly believe in god and the last day  this is best  and best in the end 
have you not seen those who profess to believe in what has been revealed to you and to other prophets before you they seek the judgement of evil people  although they were commanded not to obey them and satan wants to lead them far astray 
when they are told   come to what god has sent down and to the messenger   you see the hypocrites turn away from you 
how will it be when an affliction befalls them because of what they themselves have done they will come to you  swearing by god  saying that they were seeking nothing but goodwill and conciliation 
but god knows all that is in their hearts  so ignore what they say  admonish them and speak to them in such terms as will address their minds 
all the messengers we sent were meant to be obeyed by god s leave if they had come to you and sought forgiveness from god whenever they wronged themselves  and the messenger had prayed for forgiveness for them  they would have found that god is ever forgiving and merciful 
by your lord  they will not be true believers until they seek your arbitration in their disputes and find within themselves no doubt about what you decide and accept it wholeheartedly 
if we had commanded them   lay down your lives or leave your dwellings   they would have not done it  save a few of them if they had done what they were instructed to do  it would have been better for them  as well as more strengthening for their faith  
and we would have given them a great reward of our own 
and guided them to a straight path 
whoever obeys god and the messenger will be among those he has blessed  the messengers  the truthful  the witnesses  and the righteous what excellent companions these are 
that is god s favour sufficient is god s infinite knowledge 
you who believe  take your precautions and then go forth in small groups or go forth all together 
among you are some who lag behind and if you encounter a setback  they say   god has been gracious to me  i was not present with them  
but if  by god s grace  good fortune should be your lot  they will say   if only i had been with them i should have achieved a great success   as if no affection had existed between you and them 
let those who would exchange the life of this world for the hereafter  fight for the cause of god  whoever fights for the cause of god  whether he is slain or is victorious  to him we shall give a great reward 
and how should you not fight for the cause of god  and for the helpless old men  women  and children who say   deliver us  lord  from this city of wrongdoers  grant us a protector out of your grace and grant us a supporter out of your grace  
the believers fight for the cause of god  while those who reject faith fight for satan then fight the allies of satan  satan s scheming is truly weak 
have you not seen those to whom it was said   restrain your hands  say your prayers and pay the prescribed alms   and when they have been ordered to fight  some of them have felt afraid of human beings just as they should be afraid of god  or they are even more afraid they say   our lord  why have you ordered us to fight if you would only postpone it for a little while longer   say   the benefits of this world are negligible and the hereafter will be better for one who fears god  and you shall not be wronged in the slightest 
wherever you may be  death will overtake you  even if you be in strongly built towers   if some good befalls them  they say   this is from god   and if ill befalls them  they say   this is from you   tell them   all is from god   but what is wrong with these people that they fail to understand anything 
whatever good befalls you  it is from god  and whatever ill befalls you is from yourself we have sent you forth as a messenger to mankind  and god suffices as a witness 
he who obeys the messenger obeys god as for those who turn away  know that we have not sent you to be their keeper 
they say   we obey you   but as soon as they leave you  a group of them plan together by night against what you say god records whatever they scheme so ignore them  and put your trust in god god is sufficient as a trustee 
do they not ponder on the quran if it had been from anyone other than god  they would have found much inconsistency in it 
when they hear any news  whether of peace or of something fearful  they spread it about  whereas if they referred it to the messenger and to the men in charge  those of them who would have investigated it and could have arrived at the truth of the matter but for god s grace and mercy  all but a few of you would have followed satan 
so fight for the cause of god you are responsible only for yourself urge on the believers god may fend off the power violence of those who deny the truth  for he is stronger in might and stronger in inflicting punishment 
whoever rallies to a good cause shall have a share in its blessing  and whoever rallies to an evil cause shall be answerable for his part in it  for  indeed  god watches over everything 
when you are greeted by anyone  respond with a better greeting or at least return it  god takes account of all things 
he is god  there is no deity other than him he will gather you all together on the day of resurrection  there is no doubt about it whose word can be truer than god s 
how is it that you are divided into two groups regarding the hypocrites  when god himself cast them back to disbelief because of their misdeeds do you seek to guide those whom god allows to go astray you cannot guide those whom god allows to go astray 
they want you to deny the truth  so that you may become all alike do not take them as your allies until they emigrate in the way of god if they turn back to enmity   seize them and kill them wherever you may find them  and take no friend or helper from among them 
but make an exception of those who seek refuge with people with whom you have a treaty  or who come over to you because their hearts forbid them to fight against you or against their own people had god pleased  he would have given them power over you  so that they would have taken up arms against you therefore  if they keep away from you and cease their hostility and propose peace to you  god does not allow you to harm them 
you will find others who wish to be safe from you  and from their own people  yet whenever they find an opportunity of inflicting harm  they plunge into it so if they neither withdraw  nor offer you peace  nor restrain themselves from fighting you  seize and kill them wherever you encounter them over such people we have given you clear authority 
no believer should kill another believer  unless it be by mistake anyone who kills a believer by mistake should free a believing slave and pay blood money to the victim s relatives unless they forego it as an act of charity if the victim belongs to a people at war with you  but is a believer  then the compensation is to free a believing slave if he belongs to a people with whom you have a treaty  then blood money should be handed over to his relatives and a believing slave set free anyone who lacks the means must fast for two consecutive months such is the penance imposed by god god is all knowing and wise 
if anyone kills a believer deliberately  his reward shall be eternal hell god will condemn him and reject him  and prepare for him a terrible punishment 
believers  when you go forth in the cause of god  make due investigation and do not say to those who offer you the greeting of peace   you are no believer   because you seek the good things of this life with god there are good things in plenty you yourself were in the same position before  but god conferred his special favour on you therefore  take care to investigate surely god is well aware of what you do 
those believers who stay behind  apart from those forced by necessity  are not equal to those who strive hard in god s cause with their possessions and their persons god has given those who strive with their goods and their persons a higher rank than those who stayed behind god has promised all a good reward  but far greater is the recompense of those who strive for him   
high ranks conferred by him as well as forgiveness and mercy god is forgiving and merciful 
when the angels take the souls of those who have wronged themselves  they will ask   what was wrong with you   they will answer   we were too weak on earth   the angels will say   was god s earth not spacious enough for you to have migrated to some other place   these are the ones whose abode shall be hell  an evil destination   
except such weak ones among men  women and children  as are incapable of adopting any plan or of finding any way out 
god may well pardon them god is ever pardoning and ever forgiving 
whoever emigrates for the cause of god will find many places of refuge in the land and plentiful provision those who leave home for the cause of god and his messenger  but is then overtaken by death  shall be recompensed by god god is most forgiving and ever merciful 
when you believers are travelling in the land  you will not be blamed for shortening your prayers  if you fear the disbelievers may harm you they are your avowed enemies 
when you are among the believers and lead them in prayer  let only part of them stand up along with you  armed with their weapons after they have prostrated themselves  let them withdraw to the rear to stand guard and then let another party  who have not yet prayed  come forward and pray with you and let them also be on their guard  armed with their weapons those who deny the truth want you to be negligent of your arms and your baggage  so that they may fall upon you suddenly it is no offence for you to lay aside your arms when overtaken by heavy rain or illness  and always take every precaution for defence god has prepared a humiliating punishment for those who deny the truth 
when you have finished the prayer  remember god while standing  and sitting  and lying on your sides when you feel secure  say your prayers in the prescribed form believers are under the obligation to say their prayers at the appointed hours 
do not relent in the pursuit of the enemy if you are suffering hardships  they too are suffering similar hardships  but what you can hope for from god  they cannot god is all knowing and wise 
we have sent the book down to you with the truth so that you may judge among mankind by means of what god has shown you and do not be an advocate for the treacherous 
ask god for forgiveness  he is most forgiving and merciful 
and do not plead on behalf of those who are dishonest to themselves surely god does not love one who is treacherous and sinful 
they feel ashamed before men but do not feel ashamed before god  despite his being present with them when they plot at night  uttering things of which he does not approve  and indeed god is fully aware of what they do 
you might argue on their behalf in the life of this world  but who will argue on their behalf with god on the day of resurrection and who will be their defender 
yet anyone who does evil or wrongs his own soul and then asks god for forgiveness will find god forgiving and merciful 
he who commits sin does so against his own soul god is all knowing and wise 
and anyone who commits an offence or a sin  then charges an innocent person with it  shall certainly bear the guilt of a calumny and a manifest sin 
if it were not for the grace of god and his mercy to you  some of them had resolved to lead you astray but they lead astray no one but themselves nor can they do you any harm god has sent down to you the book and wisdom and has taught you what you did not know god s favour to you has been great indeed 
there is no good in most of their secret talk  except in the case of those who enjoin charity and kindness  or reconciliation between people if anyone does that  seeking the pleasure of god  we will give him an immense reward 
but if anyone opposes the messenger after his guidance has become clear to him  and follows a path other than that of the faithful  we shall let him pursue his chosen path and shall cast him into hell  an evil destination 
surely  god will not forgive the ascribing of partners to him he forgives whoever he will for anything other than that whoever ascribes partners to god has strayed far indeed 
they the polytheists call upon female deities  and they invoke none but satan  the rebellious one 
whom god has rejected he said to god    i will assuredly take a number of your servants 
and shall lead them astray  and fill them with vain desires and order them to slit the ears of cattle i shall order them to tamper with god s creation whoever chooses satan as a patron instead of god is utterly ruined 
he holds out promises to them  and fills them with vain desires  but satan s promises are nothing but delusion 
hell shall be their home  they shall find no refuge from it 
as for those who believe and do good works we shall admit them to gardens through which rivers flow  wherein they will abide forever this is a promise from god  and whose word could be truer than god s 
it is not your desires  nor the desires of the people of the book  that shall prevail anyone who commits evil will be rewarded accordingly he will not find any protector or patron for himself besides god 
anyone who performs good deeds  whether it be a man or woman  provided that he is a believer  shall enter paradise no one shall suffer the least injustice 
who is better in faith than one who submits himself wholly to god  acts righteously  and follows the religion of abraham  the upright in faith  whom god chose for a friend 
to god belongs all that the heavens and earth contain god has knowledge of all things 
they consult you concerning women say   god has given you directions concerning them the commandment given to you in the book concerns the orphan girls to whom you do not give what is prescribed for them  and whom you nevertheless desire to marry  and about helpless children he has instructed you to deal justly with orphans god has knowledge of all the good you do 
if a woman fears ill treatment or indifference on the part of her husband  it shall be no offence for her to seek a reconciliation  for reconciliation is best but people are prone to selfish greed if you do good and fear him  surely god is aware of what you do 
you will never be able to treat your wives with equal fairness  however much you may desire to do so  but do not ignore one wife altogether  leaving her suspended between marriage and divorce and if you make amends and act righteously  surely god is most forgiving and merciful 
if they decide to separate  god will compensate both out of his own abundance  god is bountiful and wise 
all that the heavens and the earth contain belongs to god we have commanded those who were given the scripture before you  and we command you to fear god if you deny him  know that all that the heavens and the earth contain belongs to god god is self sufficient and praiseworthy 
all that the heavens and the earth contain belongs to god  and none is as worthy of trust as god 
if he wanted  he could remove you altogether and replace you with other people  he has the full power to do so 
if one desires the rewards of this world let him remember that with god are the rewards of both this world and the life to come  and god is indeed all hearing  all seeing 
believers  be strict in upholding justice and bear witness for the sake of god  even though it be against yourselves  your parents  or your kindred be they rich or poor  god knows better about them both do not  then  follow your own desires  lest you swerve from justice if you conceal the truth or evade it  then remember that god is well aware of all that you do 
believers  believe in god and his messenger and in the scripture he sent down to his messenger  as well as what he sent down before he who denies god  his angels  his scriptures  his messengers and the last day has surely gone far astray 
as for those who come to believe  and then deny the truth  and again come to believe  and again deny the truth  and thereafter grow stubborn in their denial of the truth    god will never forgive them  nor will he guide them 
warn the hypocrites that for them there is a painful punishment 
as for those who take the deniers of the truth for their allies rather than the believers    do they seek honour in their company surely all honour belongs to god 
he has instructed you in the book that  when you hear people deny or ridicule god s revelations  you must not sit with them unless they engage in other talk  or else you yourselves shall become like them god will gather all the hypocrites and those who deny the truth together in hell 
the hypocrites wait to see what happens to you and  if god grants you a victory  they say   were we not on your side   and if those who deny the truth have a share of it victory they say to them   did we not help you win  and protect you from the believers   god will judge between you all on resurrection day and never will god allow those who deny the truth to harm the believers 
the hypocrites seek to outwit god    but it is he who outwits them and when they stand up for prayer  they do so reluctantly and to be seen by others  and they hardly remember god at all 
they vacillate between the two  belonging neither to one side nor the other but for him whom god allows to go astray you can never find the way for him 
do not take deniers of the truth who are at war with you for your allies in preference to believers would you give god a clear proof against yourselves 
the hypocrites shall surely be in the lowest depth of the fire  and you will find no helper for them 
but those who repent and mend their ways  who hold fast to god and are sincere in their worship of god will be joined with the believers  and god will bestow a great reward upon the believers 
why should god punish you  if you render thanks to him and believe in him god is appreciative and aware 
god does not love the utterance of evil words except in the case of someone who has been wronged god hears all and knows all 
whether you reveal any good or hide it  or pardon any evil  god is forgiving and all powerful 
those who deny god and his messengers and seek to make a distinction between god and his messengers and say   we believe in some messengers and disbelieve in others   and desire to adopt a position in between 
those indeed are they who are denying the truth beyond doubt  and we have prepared a humiliating punishment for the deniers 
to those who believe in god and his messengers  and make no distinction between any of them  to those    we shall surely give them their rewards god is most forgiving and merciful 
the people of the book ask you to bring down for them a book from heaven of moses they demanded a greater thing than that they said to him   show us god face to face   a thunderbolt struck them for their wickedness after that  they took to worshipping the golden calf  after all evidence of the truth had come to them  yet we pardoned even that and bestowed on moses clear authority 
and we raised above them the mount  while making a covenant with them  and we said to them  enter the gate humbly   and we also commanded them   transgress not in the matter of the sabbath   we took from them a firm covenant 
but they broke their covenant  and they rejected the signs of god  and put the prophets to death without justification  and said   our hearts are sealed   it is god who has sealed their hearts  on account of their denial of the truth except for a few of them  they have no faith 
they denied the truth and uttered a monstrous slander against mary 
they declared   we have put to death the messiah  jesus  son of mary  the messenger of god   they did not kill him  nor did they crucify him  but it only seemed to them as if it had been so and those who differ in this matter are in doubt concerning it they have no definite knowledge about it  but only follow mere conjecture but they certainly did not kill him 
god raised him towards himself god is almighty and wise 
there is none among the people of the book but will believe in it before his death  and on the day of resurrection he shall be a witness against them 
because of the wrongdoings of the jews  we forbade them certain good things that had been allowed to them before  for having frequently debarred others from god s path 
for taking usury  when they had been forbidden to do so and because of their devouring people s wealth wrongfully we have prepared a painful punishment for those of them who continue to deny the truth 
but to those of them  who are firmly grounded in knowledge  and the believers  who truly believe in what is revealed to you  and what was revealed before you to those who pray regularly and pay the zakat prescribed alms and believe in god and the last day  we will surely give a great reward 
we have sent revelation to you prophet as we did to noah and the prophets who came after him  to abraham  ishmael  isaac  jacob  and the tribes  to jesus  job  jonah  aaron  and solomon and david  to whom we gave the psalms 
we have told you about some messengers sent previously  while we have not yet told you about others god spoke to moses directly 
they were messengers  bearing good news and giving warning  so that mankind would have no excuse before god  after the coming of the messengers god is mighty  wise 
but god bears witness to what he has sent down to you he has sent it down with his knowledge the angels too bear witness and god suffices as a witness 
those who are bent on denying the truth and on turning others away from the path of god have strayed far from the right path 
god will not forgive those who deny the truth and act wrongfully  nor will he guide them 
to any path other than the path of hell  wherein they shall abide forever that is easy enough for god 
mankind  the messenger has brought you the truth from your lord  so believe for your own good and if you deny the truth  know that to god belongs all that the heavens and the earth contain god is all knowing and wise 
people of the book  do not go to extremes in your religion say nothing but the truth about god the christ jesus  son of mary  was only a messenger of god and his word  conveyed to mary  a spirit from him so believe in god and his messengers and do not say   there are three gods   desist  it will be better for you indeed  god is the one and only god his holiness is far above having a son to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and god is sufficient as a guardian 
surely  the messiah would never disdain to be accounted a servant of god nor would the angels who are nearest to him if any do disdain to worship him  and grow arrogant  he will in any case gather them all before him 
those who believe and do good works will be fully recompensed by him and he will give them yet more out of his bounty  and as for those who were disdainful and proud  he will punish them with a painful punishment and they will not find anyone to help or protect them against god 
men  you have received clear evidence from your lord we have sent down a clear light to you 
as for those who believe in god and hold fast to him  he will admit them to his mercy and his grace  he will guide them towards him on a straight path 
they ask you for instruction say   god instructs you concerning the indirect heirs if a person dies childless but has a sister  she receives half of what he leaves  and he is her heir if she dies childless if there are two sisters  they receive two thirds of what he leaves if there are brothers and sisters  the share of each male shall be that of two females god makes things clear to you  so that you will not go astray god has knowledge of all things  
believers  fulfill your obligations all livestock is lawful for you  other than that which is hereby announced to you you are forbidden to kill game while you are on a pilgrimage    god commands what he will 
believers  violate neither the sanctity of god s signs  the sacred month  the sacrificial animals  the animals wearing garlands indicating they are to be sacrificed nor those on their way to the sacred house seeking the bounty and pleasure of their lord when  on completion of your pilgrimage  you take off the garb of the pilgrim  you may hunt do not let the enmity of those who barred you from the sacred mosque lead you into sin help one another in goodness and in piety do not help one another in sin and transgression fear god  god is severe in punishment 
you are forbidden carrion  blood and pork  and any flesh over which the name of any other than god is invoked  and any creature which has been strangled  or killed by a blow or in a fall  or has been gored to death or half eaten by a wild animal  saving that which you make lawful by slaughtering properly while it was still alive and what has been slaughtered at an altar you are forbidden to make the division of meat by means of divining arrows  that is sinful conduct those who deny the truth have this day despaired of ever harming your religion so do not fear them fear me today i have completed your religion for you and completed my blessing upon you i have chosen for you islam as your religion but if anyone is forced by hunger to eat something which is forbidden  not intending to commit a sin  he will find god forgiving and merciful 
if they ask you what has been made lawful for them  say   all good things have been made lawful for you   and what you have taught your birds and beasts of prey to catch  training them as god has taught you so eat what they catch for you  but first pronounce god s name over it fear god  for god is swift in taking account 
today  all good things have been made lawful to you the food of the people of the book is lawful to you  and your food is lawful to them the chaste believing women and the chaste women of the people who were given the book before you  are lawful to you  provided that you give them their dowers  and marry them  neither committing fornication nor taking them as mistresses the deeds of anyone who rejects the faith will come to nothing  and in the hereafter he will be among the losers 
believers  when you rise to pray  wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows and wipe your heads and wash your feet up to the ankles if you are in a state of impurity  take a full bath but if you are sick or on a journey or when you have just relieved yourselves  or you have consorted with your spouses  you can find no water  take some clean sand and rub your faces and hands with it god does not wish to place any burden on you  he only wishes to purify you and perfect his favour to you  in order that you may be grateful 
remember god s favour to you  and the covenant  which he made with you when you said   we hear and we obey   fear god god has full knowledge of the innermost thoughts of men 
believers  be steadfast in the cause of god and bear witness with justice do not let your enmity for others turn you away from justice deal justly  that is nearer to being god fearing fear god god is aware of all that you do 
god has promised those who believe and do good deeds forgiveness and a great reward 
but those who deny the truth and deny our signs are destined for hell 
believers  remember the blessings which god bestowed upon you when a certain people were about to lay hands on you and he held back their hands from you have fear of god and in god let the believers place their trust 
god made a covenant with the children of israel  and raised among them twelve leaders god said   surely  i am with you if you attend to your prayers and pay the alms and believe in my messengers and support them  and give a generous loan to god  i will certainly forgive you your sins and admit you into gardens through which rivers flow whoever among you denies the truth after this shall go astray from the straight path  
since they broke their solemn pledge  we laid on them our curse and hardened their hearts they distorted the meaning of the revealed words  taking them out of their context  and forgot much of what they were enjoined you will constantly discover treachery on their part  except for a few of them but pardon them  and bear with them  truly  god loves the doers of good 
we also made a covenant with those who say   we are christians   but they too have forgotten much of what they were enjoined so  we have put enmity and hatred between them till the day of judgement  and soon god will declare to them what they have been doing 
people of the book  our messenger has come to make clear to you much of what you have hidden of the scriptures and to forgive you much a light has now come to you from god and a clear book 
whereby god guides to the ways of peace all who seek his good pleasure  bringing them from darkness to the light  by his will  and guiding them to a straight path 
in blasphemy indeed are those who say   god is christ  the son of mary   say   who then could prevent god if he so willed from destroying christ  son of mary  and his mother and everyone on earth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything between them belong to god he creates what he will and god has power over all things  
the jews and the christians say   we are the children of god and his beloved ones   say   then why does he punish you for your sins indeed  you are but human beings among those he has created he forgives whom he pleases and punishes whom he pleases the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them  belong to god and all shall return to him  
people of the book  our messenger has come to you to make things clear to you after an interval between the messengers  lest you say   no bearer of glad tidings and no warner has come to us   so a bearer of glad tidings and a warner has indeed come to you god has the power to do all things 
remember when moses said to his people   o my people  remember god s favour to you  he has raised up prophets among you  made you kings  and granted you favours such as he has not granted to anyone else in the world 
o my people  enter the holy land which god has assigned for you do not turn back  or you will be the losers  
they said   moses  in that land there is a powerful people never shall we enter it until they leave it  if they leave  then we shall certainly enter it  
thereupon two god fearing men whom god had blessed said   go into them through the gate    for as soon as you enter  you shall surely be victorious  put your trust in god if you are true believers  
they said   we will never enter it  moses  as long as they are there go  you and your lord  and fight  and we will stay here  
moses supplicated   lord  i have power over none but myself and my brother  so separate us from the disobedient people  
god said   the land is forbidden to them for forty years  while they wander around the earth  bewildered  do not grieve over these wicked people  
relate to them  the true story of the two sons of adam when they both presented an offering  it was accepted from one of them and not from the other the latter said   i shall kill you   the former said   god accepts things only from the righteous 
if you raise your hand to kill me  i will not raise mine to kill you i fear god  the lord of the universe 
and i want you to bear your sins against me as well as your own sins and become an inhabitant of the fire such is the reward of the wrongdoers  
his lower self persuaded him to kill his brother  and he killed him and he became one of the lost 
then god sent a raven  which scratched the earth  so that he might show him how to hide the corpse of his brother  alas   he cried   am i not able even to be like this raven  so that i may hide the corpse of my brother   and he repented 
that was why we laid it down for the children of israel that whoever killed a human being  except as a punishment for murder or for spreading corruption in the land  shall be regarded as having killed all mankind  and that whoever saved a human life shall be regarded as having saved all mankind our messengers came to them with clear signs  but many of them continued to commit excesses in the land 
those that make war against god and his messenger and spread disorder in the land shall be put to death or crucified or have their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides  or be banished from the country they shall be disgraced in this world  and then severely punished in the hereafter 
except for those who repent before you gain power over them  for you must know that god is forgiving and merciful 
believers  fear god and seek ways to come closer to him and strive for his cause  so that you may prosper 
as for those who reject faith  if they had everything on earth  and twice as much again and offered it to ransom themselves from the torment of the day of resurrection  it shall not be accepted from them    they will have a painful punishment 
they will want to get out of the fire but they will be unable to do so  theirs shall be a lasting punishment 
cut off the hands of thieves  whether they are male or female  as a deterrent punishment from god for what they have done god is almighty and wise 
but god will surely turn in mercy to him who repents after his transgression and reforms surely  god is most forgiving and ever merciful 
do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and earth belongs to god he punishes whom he will and forgives whom he pleases god has power over all things 
messenger  do not be grieved by those who vie with one another in denying the truth  those who say with their tongues   we believe   but have no faith in their hearts  from among the jews also  there are those who listen eagerly to any lies they listen to you to convey to others religious leaders who do not come to you out of pride and conceit they these leaders take words out of their context and say   if this be given to you  receive it  but if not  then beware   if anyone s trial is intended by god  you cannot in the least prevail against god on his behalf those whose hearts god does not intend to purify shall be subjected to disgrace in this world and a severe punishment in the hereafter 
they listen eagerly to falsehood  and devour forbidden things voraciously if they come to you  then judge between them or avoid them if you avoid them  they can in no way harm you  but if you do judge  judge them with fairness  god loves those that deal justly 
but why do they come to you for judgement when they have the torah  which enshrines god s own judgement yet  in spite of that  they turn their backs  and certainly they will not believe 
we have revealed the torah  in which there is guidance and light by it the prophets who were obedient to us judged the jews  and so did the rabbis and the priests  according to god s book which had been entrusted to their care  and to which they were witnesses have no fear of man  fear me  and do not sell my revelations for a paltry sum those who do not judge by what god has sent down are deniers of truth 
we prescribed for them in the torah   a life for a life  an eye for an eye  a nose for a nose  an ear for an ear  a tooth for a tooth  and a wound for a wound but  if anyone forgoes it  this shall be for him an expiation those who do not judge by what god has sent down are wrongdoers 
we caused jesus  son of mary to follow in their footsteps  fulfilling what had been revealed before him in the torah we gave him the gospel  which contained guidance and light  fulfilling what was revealed before it in the torah  a guide and an admonition to the god fearing 
therefore  let those who follow the gospel judge according to what god has revealed in it those who do not judge by what god has sent down are rebellious 
we have sent down the book to you with the truth  fulfilling the predictions revealed in the previous scriptures and determining what is true therein  and as a guardian over it judge  therefore  between them by what god has revealed  and do not follow their vain desires turning away from the truth that has come to you to every one of you we have ordained a law and a way  and had god so willed  he would have made you all a single community  but he did not so will  in order that he might try you by what he has given you vie  then  with one another in doing good works  to god you shall all return  then he will make clear to you about what you have been disputing 
judge between them by what god has sent down and do not be led by their desires beware of them lest they turn you away from a part of that what god has revealed to you if they reject your judgement  know that god intends to punish them for the sins they have committed indeed a large number of the people are disobedient 
is it pagan laws that they wish to be judged by who is a better judge than god for men whose faith is firm 
believers  do not take the jews and christians as allies they are allies with one another whoever of you takes them as an ally shall become one of them god does not guide the wrongdoers 
you will see those whose minds are diseased hastening towards them  saying   we fear lest a misfortune befall us   but god may well bring about victory or make a decision which is favourable to you then they will repent of the thoughts  which they secretly harboured in their hearts 
then the believers will say   are these the men who swore their strongest oaths by god  that they were with you   their works will come to nothing and they will lose all 
believers  if any among you renounce the faith  god will replace them by others who love him and are loved by him  who will be kind and considerate towards believers and firm and unyielding towards those who deny the truth they will strive hard for the cause of god and will in no way take to heart the reproaches of the fault finder such is god s bounty  which he gives to anyone he wishes god is bountiful and all knowing 
your helpers are only god and his messenger and the believers who say their prayers and pay the alms and bow down in worship 
those who ally themsleves with god  his messenger  and the believers must know that god s party is sure to triumph 
believers  do not seek the friendship of those who were given the book before you or the disbelievers who ridicule your religion and make a jest of it have fear of god  if you are true believers 
when you call them to prayer  they treat it as a jest and a diversion this is because they are devoid of understanding 
say   people of the book  do you resent us only because we believe in god and in what has been revealed to us and to others before  and because most of you are disobedient  
say   shall i tell you who will receive a worse reward from god those whom god has rejected and with whom he has been angry they were condemned as apes and swine and those who worship the evil these are in the worst plight and farthest astray from the right path  
when they come to you they say   we believe   but they come with the resolve to deny the truth and leave in the same state god knows best what they are concealing 
you see many among them vie with one another in sin and transgression and practice what is unlawful it is vile indeed what they have been doing 
why do their rabbis and scholars not forbid them to utter sinful words or to consume what is unlawful their actions are indeed vile 
the jews say   the hand of god is tied up   may their own hands be tied up and may they be cursed for what they say no indeed  his hands are both outstretched  he bestows as he will what is revealed to you from your lord will surely increase in most of them their obstinate rebellion and denial of truth  and we have sown among them enmity and hatred till the day of resurrection whenever they kindle the fire of war  god puts it out they spread evil in the land  but god does not love the evil doers 
if only the people of the book would believe and be mindful of god  we would surely pardon their sins and we would surely admit them into the gardens of bliss 
if they had observed the torah and the gospel and what was revealed to them from their lord  they would surely have been nourished from above and from below there are some among them who are on the right course  but there are many among them who do nothing but evil 
o messenger  deliver whatever has been sent down to you by your lord if you do not do so  you will not have conveyed his message god will defend you from mankind for god does not guide those who deny the truth 
say   people of the book  you have no ground to stand on until you observe the torah and the gospel and what is revealed to you from your lord   what is revealed to you from your lord will surely increase many of them in rebellion and in their denial of the truth but do not grieve for those who deny the truth 
believers  jews  sabaeans and christians  whoever believes in god and the last day and does what is right  shall have nothing to fear nor shall they grieve 
we made a covenant with the children of israel and sent forth messengers among them but whenever a messenger came to them with a message that was not to their liking  some they accused of lying  while others they put to death 
and they imagined that no harm would come to them  and so they became blind and deaf of heart god turned to them in mercy  yet again many of them became blind and deaf god is fully aware of their actions 
indeed  they are deniers of the truth who say   god is the christ  the son of mary   for the christ himself said   children of israel  serve god  my lord and your lord   if anyone associates anything with god  god will forbid him the garden and the fire will be his home the wrongdoers shall have no helpers 
they are deniers of the truth who say   god is one of three   there is only one god if they do not desist from so saying  a painful punishment is bound to befall such of them as are bent on denying the truth 
why do they not turn to god and ask for his forgiveness god is forgiving and merciful 
christ  son of mary  was no more than a messenger many messengers passed away before him his mother was a virtuous woman  and they both ate food like other mortals see how we make the signs clear to them  see how they turn away 
say   do you worship something other than god  that has no power to do you harm or good god alone is the all hearing and all knowing  
say   people of the book  do not go to extremes in your religion and do not follow the whims of those who went astray before you    they caused many to go astray and themselves strayed away from the right path  
those of the children of israel who were bent on denying the truth were cursed by david and jesus  the son of mary that was because they disobeyed and were given to transgression 
they would not prevent one another from doing the wrong things they did evil indeed were their deeds 
you see many among them allying themselves with those who deny the truth evil is that which their souls have sent on ahead for them they have incurred the wrath of god and shall suffer eternal punishment 
had they believed in god and the prophet and what was revealed to him  they would not have taken those who deny the truth as their allies  but many of them are disobedient 
you will find that the bitterest in their enmity to the faithful are the jews and the polytheists  the nearest in affection to them are those who say   we are christians   that is because there are priests and monks among them  and because they are free from pride 
when they listen to what has been sent down to the messenger  you see their eyes overflowing with tears  because of the truth they recognize they say   our lord  we believe  so count us among those who bear witness 
why should we not believe in god and in the truth that has come down to us we yearn for our lord to admit us among the righteous  
and for their words god will reward them with gardens through which rivers flow  wherein they shall abide forever that is the reward of those who do good 
but those who deny the truth and deny our signs will become the inmates of hell 
believers  do not forbid the wholesome good things  which god made lawful to you do not transgress  god does not love the transgressors 
eat the lawful and wholesome things  which god has given you fear god  in whom you believe 
god will not call you to account for your meaningless oaths  but he will call you to account for the oaths  which you swear in earnest the expiation for a broken oath is the feeding of ten needy men with such food as you normally offer to your own people  or the clothing of ten needy men  or the freeing of one slave anyone who lacks the means shall fast for three days that is the expiation of your breaking the oaths that you have sworn do keep your oaths thus god explains to you his commandments  so that you may be grateful 
believers  intoxicants and gambling and occult dedication of stones and divining arrows are abominations devised by satan avoid them  so that you may prosper 
satan seeks to sow enmity and hatred among you by means of wine and gambling  and to keep you from the remembrance of god and from your prayers will you not then abstain 
obey god and obey the messenger  and be ever on your guard against evil but if you turn away  then know that our messenger s duty is only to deliver the message clearly 
those who believe and do good deeds will not be blamed for what they may have consumed in the past   so long as they fear god and believe in him and do good works  so long as they fear god and believe in him  so long as they fear god and do good deeds for god loves those who do good 
believers  god will test you with game which come within the reach of your hands and spears  so that he may know those who fear him  even if they cannot see him anyone who oversteps the limits after this will have a painful punishment 
believers  do not kill any game while you are on a pilgrimage anyone of you who kills game deliberately shall make compensation with an animal which is the equivalent of what he has killed  to be determined by two just men from among you  as an offering brought to the ka bah  or he shall  in expiation  either feed the poor or do the equivalent of that in fasting  so that he may taste the consequence of his deeds god forgives what is past  but if anyone relapses into wrongdoing  god will exact his retribution god is mighty  the lord of retribution 
to hunt and to eat the fish of the sea is made lawful for you  a provision made for you and for seafarers but you are forbidden the game of the land while you are on a pilgrimage have fear of god  before whom you shall all be gathered 
god has made the ka bah  the sacred house  a means of support as well as the sacred month and the sacrificial animals with their garlands that is so that you may know that god has knowledge of whatever is in the heavens and on the earth and that he is fully aware of all things 
know that god is severe in punishment  yet most forgiving and merciful 
the messenger s sole duty is to convey the message god knows what you reveal and what you hide 
say   the bad and the good are not alike  even though the abundance of the bad may appear pleasing to you so fear god  o men of understanding  so that you may prosper  
believers  do not ask questions about things which  if they were made known to you  would only become burdensome for you  but if you ask them when the quran is being revealed  they shall be made plain to you    god has kept silent about them  god is most forgiving and forbearing 
other people before you enquired about such things  but when they were disclosed to them  they refused to carry them out 
god has ordained no sanctity about animals described as bahirah  or sa ibah  or wasilah or ham those who deny the truth invent falsehoods about god most of them do not use their reason 
when it is said to them   come to what god has sent down and to the messenger   they reply   the faith we have inherited from our fathers is sufficient for us   even though their forefathers knew nothing and were not guided 
believers  take care of your own souls the misguided cannot harm you as long as you are guided all of you will return to god then he will make you realize that which you used to do 
believers  when death approaches you  let two just men from among you act as witnesses when you make your testaments  or two men from another tribe  if the calamity of death overtakes you while you are travelling in the land detain them after prayers  and if you doubt their honesty  let them swear by god   we will not sell our testimony for any price  even to a kinsman and we will not conceal the testimony of god if we did  we would indeed be guilty of sin  
if it turns out that both prove dishonest  two others should take their place from amongst those whose rights have been usurped and let them swear by god  saying   our testimony is indeed truer than the testimony of these two and we have not been guilty of any misstatement for then indeed we would be transgressors  
that makes it more likely that people will bear true witness  or else they will fear that their oaths will be contradicted by the oaths of others heed god and listen  god does not guide a rebellious  disobedient people 
the day when god assembles the messengers and asks them   what was the response you received from the people   they will reply   we have no knowledge of it you alone know what is hidden  
then god will say   jesus  son of mary  remember my favour to you and to your mother  how i strengthened you with the holy spirit  so that you could speak to people in childhood and in maturity  and how i taught you the book  and wisdom  the torah and the gospel  how by my leave you fashioned from clay the shape of a bird and blew upon it  so that  by my leave  it became a bird  and healed the blind and the leper by my permission  and when you brought forth the dead by my permission  and how i prevented the children of israel from harming you when you came to them with clear signs  when those of them who denied the truth said   this is sheer magic  
 remember the time   when i inspired the disciples to believe in me and in my messenger  they replied   we believe  bear witness that we have submitted  
when the disciples said   o jesus  son of mary  can your lord send down to us from heaven a table spread with food   he replied   have fear of god  if you are true believers  
they said   we want to eat from it  so that we may satisfy our hearts and know that you have told us the truth  and that we should be witnesses of it  
jesus  son of mary  said   o god  our lord  send down for us a table spread with food from heaven  so that it may be a feast for us  for the first of us and for the last of us  a sign from you give us our sustenance  for you are the best of sustainers  
god replied   i will certainly send it down to you  but whosoever of you deny the truth thereafter will be punished with a punishment such as i have never meted out to anyone else in the world  
when god says   jesus  son of mary  did you say to people   take me and my mother as two deities besides god    he will answer   glory be to you  how could i ever say that to which i have no right if i had ever said so  you would surely have known it you know what is in my mind  while i do not know anything that is within yours you alone are the knower of unseen things   
i told them only what you commanded me to   worship god  my lord and your lord   i was a witness to what they did as long as i remained among them  and when you took my soul  you were the watcher over them you are the witness of all things 
and if you punish them  they are surely your servants  and if you forgive them  you are surely the mighty and wise  
god will say   this is the day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness they shall forever dwell in gardens through which rivers flow god is pleased with them and they with him  that is the supreme triumph 
the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in them belongs to god  he has power over all things 
praise be to god  who has created the heavens and the earth and brought into being darkness and light yet those who deny the truth set up equals to their lord 
it is he who has created you out of clay  and then has decreed a term for you   a term known only to him yet you are still in doubt 
he is god both in the heavens and on earth he has knowledge of all that you hide and all that you reveal he knows what you do 
yet every time a sign comes to them from their lord  they turn away from it 
they have rejected truth whenever it came to them  yet more news will reach them concerning what they have been making a mockery of 
have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them we established them on the earth more firmly than you  and we sent the clouds over them  pouring down abundant rain  and made the rivers flow at their feet yet we destroyed them for their sins  and raised up other generations after them 
but even if we had sent down to you a book written on parchment  and they had touched it with their own hands    those who deny the truth would still have said   this is mere magic  
they ask   why has an angel not been sent down to him   if we did send down an angel  the matter would be settled and they would not have been granted any respite 
indeed  if we had sent an angel as messenger  we would have made him in the form of a man as well  and would have thus added to their confusion 
messengers have been mocked before you  but those who scoffed were overtaken by the very thing they scoffed at 
say   travel about the land and see what was the end of the deniers  
say   to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and earth   say   to god he has taken it upon himself to be merciful that he will gather you on the day of resurrection is beyond all doubt those who have forfeited their souls will never have faith  
to him belongs all that dwells in the night and the day he is the all hearing and the all knowing 
say   shall i take as my protector someone other than god  creator of the heavens and the earth  who feeds all and is fed by none   say   i have been commanded to be the first of those who submit do not be one of the polytheists  
say   i will never disobey my lord  for i fear the punishment of a dreadful day  
anyone from whom punishment is averted on that day has been shown great mercy by god that is a supreme achievement 
if god should let any harm touch you  no one could remove it except he  while if he should let some good touch you  know that he has the power to do all that he wills 
he reigns supreme over his servants  and he is the all wise  the all aware 
ask them   what carries the most weight as a witness   tell them it is god he is a witness between you and me say   this quran has been revealed to me so that through it i may warn you and whoever it reaches do you really bear witness that there are other deities beside god   say   i do not bear witness to this   say   he is only one god  and i disown whatever you associate with him  
those to whom we have given the scriptures know this as they know their own sons but those who have ruined their souls will not believe 
who does greater wrong than he who invents a lie against god and denies his signs assuredly  the wrongdoers will not succeed 
on the day when we gather them all together  we will say to those who associated others with us    where are those partners that you claimed  
then they will have no excuse but to say   by god our lord  we have never been polytheists  
see how they lie to themselves  and how those the deities they invented have deserted them 
among them are some who listen to you  but we have placed veils over their hearts and deafness in their ears which prevent them from understanding what you say even if they saw all the signs  they would still not believe in them when those who deny the truth come to dispute with you  they will say   this is nothing but ancient fables  
and they bar others from believing and themselves keep away but they ruin no one but themselves  though they fail to realize this 
if you could only see when they are set before the fire they will say   if only we could be sent back then we would not deny the signs of our lord and we would be of the believers  
the truth they used to hide will become all too clear to them but if they were sent back  they would return to what they had been forbidden for they are indeed liars 
they say   there is nothing beyond our life in this world  we shall not be raised up again from the dead  
if you could only see when they are made to stand before their lord  he will ask them   is this second life not the truth   they will say   yes  by our lord   he will say   then  taste the punishment that comes from your having refused to acknowledge the truth  
those indeed are the losers who deny the meeting with god when the hour comes on them suddenly  they cry   alas for us  that we neglected it   they shall bear their burdens on their backs evil are the burdens they shall bear 
the life of this world is but a sport and a pastime surely the home of the hereafter is best for those who fear god will you not understand 
we know that what they say grieves you it is not you that the wrongdoers are rejecting  rather it is the signs of god that they reject 
other messengers have been denied before you  and they bore their rejection and persecution steadfastly  until our help came to them there is no one who can change the words of god you have already received some account of those messengers 
if you find their rejection hard to bear  then seek a tunnel into the ground or a ladder into the sky  if you can  and bring them a sign had god so willed  he would indeed have given them all his guidance so do not be among the ignorant 
only they who listen can respond to a call  and as for the dead  god will raise them up  and then they will all return to him 
they ask   why has no sign been sent down to him from his lord   say   god alone has the power to send down a sign   but most of them do not understand 
there is not an animal that moves about on the earth  nor a bird that flies on its two wings  but are creatures like you we have left out nothing in the book    they shall all be gathered before their lord 
those who reject our signs are deaf and dumb  groping along in darkness god lets anyone he wishes go astray and sets whoever he will on a straight path 
say   tell me if the punishment of god came upon you or the hour overtook you  would you call upon any other than god  if you are truthful  
indeed  it is on him that you would call  and he could remove that affliction which made you call on him  if he will  and then you would forget the false deities which you associate with him  
we sent messengers before you prophet to many communities and afflicted their people with suffering and hardship  so that they might humble themselves 
when the affliction decreed by us befell them  they did not humble themselves  but rather their hearts hardened  for satan had made all their doings seem fair to them 
when they had forgotten our admonition  we granted them all that they desired  but just as they were rejoicing in what they were given  we seized them suddenly and they were plunged into despair 
the wrongdoers were thus annihilated all praise be to god  the lord of the worlds 
say   if god should take away your hearing and your sight and seal your hearts  who is the deity who could restore it to you save god   see how we explain the signs to them in diverse ways  yet they turn away 
ask them   tell me  if the punishment of god came upon you suddenly or predictably  would any but the wrongdoers be destroyed  
we send the messengers only to give good news and to warn  so those who believe and reform themselves need have no fear  nor will they grieve 
chastisement will befall those who reject our signs because of their disobedience 
say   i do not say to you that i possess the treasures of god  nor do i know the unseen  nor do i say to you that i am an angel i follow only that which is revealed to me   say   are the blind and the seeing alike can you not then think  
warn by it those who fear to be gathered before their lord  when they have no guardian or intercessor besides god  so that they may become god fearing 
do not send away those who call upon their lord in the morning and in the evening  seeking only his grace you are not by any means accountable for them  nor are they accountable for you if you turn them away  you yourself will become one of the unjust 
in this way we try some of them by means of others  so that they may ask   are these lowly ones whom god has singled out for his favours from among us does god not know best who are the grateful ones  
when those who believe in our revelations come to you  say   peace be upon you your lord has taken it upon himself to be merciful so that if any one among you does evil in ignorance and repents thereafter and makes amends  then he is most forgiving and ever merciful  
thus we make plain our signs  so that the path of the evil doers might be laid bare 
say   i am forbidden to worship those you call upon besides god   say   i do not follow your whims and desires if i did  i would go astray and cease to be rightly guided  
say   i stand by the clear evidence from my lord  yet you deny it what you seek to hasten is not within my power judgement is for god alone he declares the truth he is the best of judges  
say   if what you seek to hasten were within my power  the matter would be settled between you and me god best knows the evil doers  
he holds the keys to the unseen  none knows them but he he has knowledge of all that land and sea contain no leaf falls without his knowledge  nor is there a single grain in the darkness of the earth  or anything  wet or dry  but is recorded in a clear record 
it is he who gathers you in at night and knows all that you do by day  then he raises you up during the day so that an appointed term may be completed then to him you shall return and he will declare to you all that you used to do 
he is the absolute master over his servants he sends forth guardians angels who watch over you until  when death approaches one of you  our angels take his soul  and they never fail in their duty 
then they will all be returned to god  their true lord the judgement is his alone he is the swiftest reckoner 
say   who is it who delivers you from the dark depths of land and sea when you call out to him humbly and in secret  saying   if he rescues us from this  we shall most certainly be among the grateful    
say   it is god who delivers you from it and from every other distress  yet you associate partners with him  
say   he has the power to send punishment on you from above your heads or from beneath your feet  or to divide you in sects and make you taste one another s violence   see how we explain our revelations in various ways  so that they may understand 
your people have rejected the message we have sent through you  though it is the truth say  i am not your keeper 
every prophecy has its fixed time to be fulfilled  and soon you will come to know  
when you see people engaged in finding fault with our revelations  withdraw from them until they turn to some other topic should satan cause you to forget this  take leave of the wrongdoers as soon as you remember 
the god fearing are not in any way held accountable for the wrongdoers  their only duty is to remind them  so that they may fear god 
leave alone those for whom religion is only a sport and pastime and are deceived by the life of this world  but continue to remind them with the quran  lest a soul be held in pledge because of what it has wrought  having no helper or intercessor besides god whatever ransom they may offer  it will not be accepted such are those that are damned by their own actions  they will have boiling water to drink and a painful punishment for their denial of truth 
say   instead of god  shall we call upon that which can neither benefit us nor harm us are we to turn upon our heels after god has guided us  like one who  beguiled by devils in the land  wanders bewildered  his companions calling him to the right path  saying   come to us    say   god s guidance is the only guidance we are commanded to surrender ourselves to the lord of the universe 
say our prayers regularly and to fear god   he it is to whom you will be gathered  
it was he who created the heavens and the earth for a true purpose on the day when he says   be   it shall be  his word is the truth all sovereignty shall be his on the day when the trumpet is sounded the knower of the unseen and the visible  he is the wise  the aware one 
remember when abraham said to his father  azar   do you take idols as your gods i see that you and your people have clearly gone astray  
in this way we showed abraham our kingdom of the heavens and the earth  so that he might have certainty of faith 
when night descended on him  he saw a star he said   this is my lord   then when it set he said   i do not love things that set  
when he saw the moon rise and spread its light  he said   this is my lord   but when it set  he said   if my lord does not guide me  i will be one of the misguided people  
then  when he saw the sun shining  he said   this is my lord  this is the greatest of all   then when it set  he said   my people  i disown all that you worship besides god 
i have set my face with single minded devotion  towards him who has created the heavens and the earth  and i am not one of the polytheists  
his people argued with him he said   are you arguing with me about god  while he has guided me i have no fear of any partner you ascribe to him  unless my lord should wish otherwise my lord encompasses all things in his knowledge  so will you not pay heed 
why should i fear what you associate with him  while you do not fear to associate with god that for which he has sent down to you no authority tell me  if you know the truth  which side has more right to feel secure 
it is those who have faith  and do not mix their faith with wrongdoing  who will be secure  and it is they who are rightly guided  
this is the reasoning we gave to abraham against his people  we raise in rank anyone we please  your lord is wise and aware 
we gave him isaac and jacob  each of whom we guided as we had guided noah before among his descendants were david and solomon  and job  joseph  moses and aaron thus do we reward the righteous 
zachariah  john  jesus  and elijah  every one of them was righteous 
ishmael  elisha  jonah  and lot    we favoured each one of them above other people 
and also some of their forefathers  their offspring  and their brothers  we chose them and guided them to a straight path 
this is the guidance of god  he gives that guidance to whichever of his servants he pleases if they had associated other deities with him  surely all they did would have been of no avail 
those are the ones to whom we gave the scripture  wisdom  and prophethood if these people the makkans reject it  we shall entrust it to a people who will never refuse to acknowledge it 
those the previous prophets were the people whom god guided follow their guidance then and say   i ask no reward for this from you  it is only a reminder for all mankind  
they do not make a just estimate of god  when they say   god has not revealed anything to any human being   say   who revealed the book which moses brought  a light and guidance for the people  which you made into separate sheets  showing some but hiding many you have been taught things that neither you nor your forefathers had known before   say   god has sent it   then leave them toying away with their speculation 
this is a blessed book which we have revealed  confirming what came before it  so that you may warn the mother of cities makkah and the people around it those who believe in the hereafter do believe in it  and they are ever mindful of their prayers 
who could do greater wrong than someone who invents a lie against god or who says   it has been revealed to me   while nothing has been revealed to him  or someone who says   i will send down the like of what god has sent down  if you could only see the wrongdoers in the throes of death when the angels are stretching out their hands  saying   give up your souls today you will be repaid with a humiliating punishment for saying false things about god and being arrogant about his signs  
and now you have returned to us  alone as we created you at first  leaving behind all that we gave you nor do we see with you your intercessors  those you claimed were your partners with god the link between you is cut and that which you presumed has failed you 
it is god who splits the seed and the fruit stone he brings forth the living from the dead  and the dead from the living that is god how then can you  deluded  turn away from the truth 
he causes the break of day  and has made the night for rest and he made the sun and the moon to a precise measure that is the measure determined by the all mighty and the all knowing 
it is he who has set up for you the stars so that you might be guided by them in the midst of the darkness of land and sea we have made the signs clear for people who want to understand 
it is he who first produced you from a single soul  then gave you a place to stay in life and a resting place after death we have made our revelations clear to those who are men of understanding 
it is he who sends down water from the sky with it we produce vegetation of all kinds  out of green foliage  we produce clustered grain  and from the date palm  out of its sheath  we produce bunches of dates hanging low we produce vineyards and olive groves and pomegranates  alike yet different look at their fruit as he causes it to grow and ripen in this are signs for people who believe 
they have set up jinns as associates with god  even though he created them  they have even dared  in their ignorance  to attribute sons and daughters to him hallowed be he and exalted far above what they ascribe to him 
the originator of the heavens and the earth how could he have a son when he has no consort he created everything and is aware of everything 
this is god  your lord  there is no god but him  the creator of all things  so worship him  he is the guardian of all things 
no vision can grasp him  but he takes in over all vision  he is the subtle and aware one 
clear insights have come to you from your lord whoever  therefore  chooses to see  does so for his own good  and whoever chooses to remain blind  does so to his own loss say   i am not here as your keeper  
this is how we explain our revelations in various ways    so that they might come to the point of saying   you have read this out to us   and that we might make it clear that this is the truth to those who are eager to know 
follow what has been revealed to you from your lord  there is no deity but him  and ignore the polytheists 
if god had willed  they would not have associated anything with him we did not appoint you over them as their keeper  nor are you their guardian 
do not revile those beings whom they invoke instead of god  lest they  in their hostility  revile god out of ignorance thus to every people we have caused their actions to seem fair to their lord they shall all return  and he will declare to them all that they have done 
they swear a solemn oath by god that if there should come to them a sign  they will believe in it say   signs are granted only by god   how can you tell that if a sign be given to them  they will indeed believe in it 
we will turn away their hearts and eyes from the truth  since they refused to believe in it in the first instance we will let them wander blindly in their insolence 
even if we sent down angels to them  and caused the dead to speak to them  and we gathered together everything in front of them  they would still not believe  unless god had so willed but most of them behave ignorantly 
in like manner we have assigned for every prophet an opponent  satans from among men and jinn  who make evil suggestions to each other by means of specious words in order to deceive    had it been your lord s will  they would not have done so  so leave them alone to their fabrication 
in order that the hearts of those who do not believe in the life to come might incline towards those suggestions and  being pleased  persist in their sinful ways 
should i seek a judge other than god  when it is he who has revealed the book  clearly explained those to whom we gave the book earlier know that it is the truth revealed by your lord therefore  have no doubts 
the word of your lord is perfected in truth and justice none can change his words he is the all hearing  the all knowing 
if you obey the majority of those on earth  they will lead you astray from god s way they follow nothing but conjecture they are only guessing 
your lord knows best who has strayed from his way and he knows best those who are guided 
eat then  only that over which god s name has been pronounced  if you truly believe in his revelations 
why should you not eat what has been consecrated in god s name  when he has already explained to you what he has forbidden you  unless you are compelled by necessity surely  many mislead others by their desires through lack of knowledge but your lord best knows the transgressors 
eschew all sin  open or secret  those who commit sin will receive due punishment for their sins 
and do not eat anything over which god s name has not been pronounced  for that surely is disobedience the devils inspire their followers to argue with you if you obey them  you will become of those who associate partners with god 
can he who was dead  to whom we gave life  and a light whereby he could walk among people be like him who is in utter darkness from which he can never emerge thus the deeds of those who deny the truth have been made fair seeming to them 
thus we have placed leaders of the wicked in every town to plot therein yet it is only against themselves that they scheme  though they may not perceive it 
when a sign comes to them  they say   we will not believe in it until we are given what god s messengers have been given but god knows best whom to appoint as his messenger humiliation before god and severe torment will befall the evil doers for their scheming 
when god desires to guide someone  he opens his breast to islam  and whoever he wills to let go astray  he causes his breast to be constricted as if he had to climb up to the skies that is how god heaps ignominy upon those who refuse to believe 
this is the straight path leading to your lord we have made the signs clear for thinking men 
they shall dwell in the home of peace with their lord  he will be their protector as a recompense for what they have been doing 
on the day when he gathers them all together  he will say   company of jinn  you took away many followers among mankind   and their adherents among mankind will say   our lord  we benefited from one another  but now we have reached the end of the term which you determined for us   he will say   the fire shall be your home  and there you shall remain forever  except as god wills surely your lord is wise and all knowing 
and in like manner we shall keep the wrongdoers close to others as a punishment for their misdeeds 
company of jinn and mankind  did messengers not come from among you to recite my revelations to you  and warn you of the meeting of this day   they will say   we bear witness against ourselves   it was the life of this world that deceived them and so they will bear witness against themselves  that they rejected the truth 
your lord would not destroy a community for its wrongdoing  so long as its people were still unaware 
for all are degrees of rank according to their deeds  your lord is not unaware of anything they do 
your lord is the self sufficient one  the merciful if he wills  he can take you away and replace you by anyone he pleases  just as he raised you from the offspring of other people 
that which you are promised shall surely come to pass and you cannot prevent it 
say   o my people  go on acting in your way  indeed i am going to act in my way  soon you will know whose end will be best in the hereafter   surely  the wrongdoers shall not prosper 
they set aside for god a share in what he has produced  such as crops and livestock  and they say   this is for god   so they claim   and  this is for our associate gods   their associate gods share does not reach god  whereas god s share reaches their associate gods how ill they judge 
and in like manner  their associate gods have made killing their children seem fair to many pagans  so that they may ruin them and cause confusion in their religion had god pleased  they would not have done so  so leave them to their false inventions 
they also say   these animals and these crops are forbidden none may eat them except those we permit   so they claim  there are some animals they exempt from labour and some over which they do not pronounce god s name  thus committing a sin against him he will requite them for the falsehoods they invent 
they say   what is in the wombs of such and such cattle is exclusively for our males and is forbidden to our females but if it is stillborn  they may have a share of it   god will soon punish them for their false attribution he is wise  and all knowing 
losers indeed are they who kill their children foolishly and without knowledge and declare as forbidden what god has provided for them as sustenance    a fabrication against god  they have gone astray and have not chosen to be rightly guided 
it is he who has produced gardens  both trellised and untrellised  and date palms and field crops  all varying in taste  and the olive and the pomegranate  both similar and dissimilar eat their fruits when they bear fruit and give away what is due of them on the day of their harvest do not waste anything he does not love the wasteful 
of the cattle there are some for carrying burdens and some for food eat what god has provided for you and do not follow in satan s footsteps  for he is a declared enemy of yours 
god has created four kinds of livestock of either sex  two of sheep and two of goats ask them   is it the two males he has forbidden or the two females or what the wombs of the two females contain tell me on the basis of knowledge  if you are truthful  
again  of the camels there are two  and of the oxen two ask them   is it the two males he has forbidden  or the two females or what the wombs of the two females contain were you present when god enjoined this on you   who is more unjust than one who  without knowledge  fabricates a lie against god  so that he may lead people astray without knowledge surely  god does not guide the wrongdoers 
say o prophet    in all that has been revealed to me  i do not find a ban on anything to eat  except for carrion  flowing blood and pork  all these being unclean or profane  on which the name of someone other than god has been invoked   but if anyone is forced by necessity  being neither disobedient nor exceeding the limit  then surely your lord is most forgiving and merciful 
we forbade the jews all animals with claws and the fat of sheep and goats and oxen  except what is on their backs and in their intestines and what adheres to their bones that is the penalty we imposed on them for their disobedience and we assuredly are true to our word 
so  if they accuse you of lying  say   the mercy of your lord is all encompassing his punishment cannot be averted from sinful men  
those who associate partners with god will surely say   had god pleased  neither we nor our fathers would have served other gods besides him  nor would we have made anything unlawful   likewise those who lived before them argued falsely until they came to taste our punishment  say   have you any knowledge if so  produce it before us you follow nothing but conjecture you are merely guessing  
say   god alone has the conclusive proof if he had willed  he could have guided every one of you  
say   come  bring your witnesses  who can testify that god forbade all this   if they bear witness falsely   do not bear witness with them  nor yield to the wishes of those who deny our signs  nor of those who do not believe in the life to come and set up others as equals with their lord 
say   come  i will tell you what your lord has really forbidden you  do not associate anything with him  be good to your parents  and do not kill your children for fear of poverty  we shall provide sustenance for you as well as for them  refrain from committing indecent deeds  whether openly or in secret  and do not kill the life which god has made sacred  save by right that is what he has enjoined upon you  so that you may understand 
stay well away from an orphan s property  except with the best intentions  before he comes of age give full measure and weight  according to justice  we never charge a soul with more than it can bear  when you speak  observe justice  even though it concerns a close relative  and fulfil the covenants of god that is what he has enjoined upon you so that you may take heed 
 he has enjoined    this is my straight path  so follow it  and do not follow other ways  that will lead you away from his path   that is what he enjoins upon you  so that you may guard yourselves 
then we gave moses the book  completing our favour to the righteous  explaining everything clearly  as guidance and mercy  so that they might believe in meeting their lord 
this is a book which we have revealed as a blessing  follow it and fear your lord  so that you may receive mercy 
and not say   the book was only sent down to the two groups before us and we were indeed unaware of their teachings  
or you may say   if the book had been sent down to us  we would surely have followed its guidance better than they did   there has now come to you clear evidence from your lord  and guidance and mercy who  then  is more unjust than one who rejects the signs of god and turns away from them we shall requite those who turn away from our signs with a painful punishment  for their turning away 
are they waiting for the angels or your lord to come down to them  or for some of your lord s signs to come the day when some of the signs of your lord shall come  it shall not profit any human being who did not believe before  or who did not do any good by his faith say to them   wait then  we too are waiting  
have nothing to do with those who have split up their religion into sects their case rests with god  he will tell them about what they used to do 
whoever does a good deed will be repaid tenfold  but those who do a bad deed will only be repaid with its equivalent and they shall not be wronged 
say   my lord has guided me to a straight path  and to an upright religion  the religion of abraham the upright  who was not of those who associate partners with god  
say   my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are all for god  the lord of the worlds 
he has no partner so am i commanded  and i am the first of those who submit  
say   shall i seek a lord other than god  while he is the lord of all things   everyone must bear the consequence of what he does  and no bearer of a burden can bear the burden of another then to your lord you will return  and he will inform you of what you used to dispute about 
it is he who has made you successors of others on the earth and has exalted some of you over the others in degrees of rank  so that he may test you by that which he has given you your lord is swift in punishment  yet surely he is forgiving  and merciful 
alif lam mim sad 
this book has been sent down to you  let there be no heaviness in your heart about it  so that you may warn by means of it and it is a reminder to the believers 
follow what has been sent down to you by your lord and do not follow any protector other than him how seldom you take heed 
how many towns we have destroyed our scourge fell upon them by night or at midday when they were resting 
and when our scourge fell upon them  their only cry was   we were indeed wrongdoers  
then shall we question those to whom our message was sent and those through whom we sent it
with full knowledge  we shall tell them what they did  for we have never been away from them 
truth alone will be of weight that day those whose scales are heavy shall be successful 
and those whose good deeds are light in the balance will be the ones who have lost themselves because they wrongfully rejected our signs 
we established you in the land and provided you with a means of livelihood there  yet you are seldom thankful 
we created you  then we shaped you and then we said to the angels   prostrate yourselves before adam   and they all prostrated themselves  except satan he was not among those who prostrated themselves 
god asked   what prevented you from prostrating yourself when i commanded you to   he replied   i am better than he is  you created me from fire  while you created him from clay  
god said   get down from here  this is no place for your arrogance get out  you are contemptible  
satan said   give me respite until the day of resurrection  
and god replied   you are granted respite  
then satan said   because you have put me in the wrong  i will lie in ambush for them on your straight path 
then i will surely come upon them from before them and from behind them and from their right and from their left  and then you will find most of them ungrateful  
he said   get out of here  despised  and rejected  i shall fill hell with all of those who follow you  
to adam he said   you and your wife  dwell in the garden and eat and drink there from wherever you wish  but do not approach this tree  lest you become wrongdoers  
but satan tempted them so that he might reveal to them their nakedness which had been hidden from them he said   your lord has forbidden you to approach this tree lest you should become angels or become of the immortals  
and he swore to them   surely  i am your well wisher  
thus he cunningly seduced them when they tasted the tree s fruit  their nakedness became exposed to them and they started covering themselves with the leaves of the garden their lord called out to them   did i not forbid you to approach that tree  and did i not say to you that satan was surely your open enemy  
they replied   our lord  we have wronged our souls  if you do not forgive us and have mercy on us  we shall be among the lost  
he said   go down from here as enemies to each other for a while  there is an abode for you and a provision on earth 
there you will live  there you will die  from there you will be raised up again  
o children of adam  we have sent down to you clothes to cover your nakedness  and to be pleasing to the eye  but the raiment of righteousness is the best that is one of the signs of god so that people may take heed 
children of adam  do not let satan seduce you  just as he turned your parents out of the garden  he deprived them of their garment in order to make them aware of their nakedness he and his forces watch you from where you do not see them  we have made the devils friends of those who do not believe 
and when they commit an indecency  they say   this is what our fathers used to do and god has enjoined it on us   say   god does not enjoin what is indecent would you attribute to god something of which you have no knowledge  
say   my lord has commanded you to act justly turn your faces up toward him at every time and place of worship  and call upon him  making yourselves sincere towards him in religion as he brought you into being  so shall you return  
some he has guided and some have earned misguidance  they have taken devils rather than god as their patrons  thinking that they are rightly guided 
o children of adam  dress yourself properly whenever you are at worship  and eat and drink but do not be wasteful  god does not like wasteful people 
say   who has forbidden the adornment of god  which he has brought forth for his servants and good things  clean and pure  which god has provided for his servants   say   they are lawful for the believers in the present life but they shall be exclusively for them on the day of resurrection   thus we explain our signs for a people who understand 
say  my lord has forbidden indecency  both open and hidden  sin and wrongful oppression and that  without his sanction  you associate things with him  and that you say things about him without knowledge 
for all people a term has been set  and when the end of their term approaches  they can neither delay it by a single moment  nor can they advance it 
children of adam  if messengers come to you from among yourselves  reciting my revelations to you  then those that take warning and mend their ways  on such shall come no fear nor shall they grieve 
but those who deny and scorn our revelations shall be the inmates of hell  where they shall remain forever 
who does a greater wrong than he who invents lies against god or rejects his revelations such people will have what has been decreed for them and when our messengers come to them to take away their souls  they shall ask them   where are those you used to call upon besides god   they will answer   they have deserted us   and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers 
god will say   enter the fire and join the bands of jinn and men that have gone before you   every time a host enters the fire   it will curse its fellow host  then  when they are all gathered there  the last of them will say of the first   our lord  it was they who led us astray  give them double punishment in the fire      god will say   every one of you will have double punishment  though you do not know it    
then the preceding one will say to the succeeding one  you are no better than us  so taste the punishment you have earned  
the gates of heaven shall not be opened for those who rejected our signs and arrogantly spurned them  nor shall they enter paradise until a camel shall pass through the eye of a needle that is how we repay the evil doers 
hell shall be their bed  and over them will be coverings of fire  thus shall we reward the wrongdoers 
but those who believed and did good deeds  and we do not burden any soul with more than it can bear  such are the heirs of the garden and there they will remain forever 
and we shall remove whatever rancour may be in their hearts at their feet shall flow rivers and they shall say   all praise belongs to god who has guided us to this had god not guided us  we would never have found the way the messengers of our lord brought the truth   a voice will call out to them   this is the garden which you have inherited by your labours  
the people of the garden will call out to the people of the fire   we have found that what our lord promised us is true have you  too  found that what your lord promised you is true   they will say   yes  we have   then a crier shall call out among them saying   the curse of god is upon the wrongdoers   
who turned people away from the path of god and sought to make it appear crooked  and who denied the hereafter  
a barrier will divide the two groups  and on the heights there will be men who recognize each group by their marks they will call out to the people of the garden   peace be with you   they will not have yet entered  but they will be hoping to do so  
and when they turn their eyes towards the inmates of the fire  they will say   our lord  do not include us among the wrongdoers  
and the people of the heights will call out to men they recognize by their marks   what use have your great numbers and your false pride been 
see  are these not the people you swore would never earn god s mercy enter the garden  no fear shall come upon you nor shall you grieve  
the people of the fire shall call out to the people of heaven   pour out some water on us  or give us something out of that which god has bestowed upon you   but the blessed will reply   god has forbidden all that to those who denied the truth 
who treated religion as a pastime and an idle sport and whom the life of the world had beguiled   on that day we shall forget them  as they forgot their meeting of that day with us  for they denied our revelations 
and surely we have brought them a book which we have expounded with knowledge  a guide and a mercy for those who believe 
do they wait for the fulfillment of that of which it warns on the day when that fulfillment comes  those who had neglected it before will say   the messengers of our lord did indeed bring the truth have we then any intercessors who would intercede for us or  could we be sent back so that we might act differently from the way we used to   they have indeed ruined their souls and what they invented has forsaken them 
your lord is god  who created the heavens and the earth in six days periods and then settled himself firmly on the throne he throws the veil of night over the day  each seeking the other in rapid succession it was he who created the sun  the moon and the stars  and made them subservient to his will his is the creation  his the command blessed be god  lord of the universe 
call on your lord with humility and in secret  he does not love the transgressors 
do not spread corruption on the earth after it has been set in order  pray to him with fear and hope  god s mercy is close to those who do good 
it is god who sends forth the winds as harbingers of his mercy  and when they have gathered up the heavy clouds  we drive them on to a dead land where we cause rain to fall  bringing out all kinds of fruit  just as we will raise the dead to life perhaps you will take heed 
vegetation comes out of good land in abundance by the will of its lord  but out of bad land only scantily thus we explain our signs in diverse ways for those who give thanks 
we sent noah to his people he said   o my people  worship god  you have no other god but he i fear for you the punishment of a dreadful day  
but the leading men of his people said   truly  we see that you are obviously lost in error  
said noah    o my people  i am not in error indeed  i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds 
i am conveying my lord s messages to you and giving you sincere advice i know things from god that you do not 
do you find it so strange that a message should come from your lord through a man from among yourselves  so that he may warn you and so that you may fear god and be shown mercy  
but they denied him  so we saved him and those with him in the ark  and we drowned those who rejected our signs they were indeed a blind people 
to the people of ad we sent their brother  hud he said   o my people  worship god  you have no other god but he then will you not be god fearing  
the leading men of his people who refused to acknowledge the truth  said   we can see you are a foolish man  and we think you are lying  
he said   my people  i am by no means a fool  but rather am a messenger from the lord of the universe 
i am conveying my lord s messages to you and i am your sincere and honest adviser 
do you find it strange that a message should come from your lord  through one of your own men  to warn you remember how he made you successors of noah s people  and increased you greatly in stature remember the favours of god  so that you may prosper  
they said   have you come to tell us to serve god alone and to forsake the gods our forefathers served bring us then what you threaten us with  if you are truthful  
he said   your lord s wrath and indignation have already fallen upon you would you dispute with me about mere names  which you and your fathers have invented  and for which god has revealed no authority wait then if you will  i am waiting alongside you  
then we saved him and those who were with him  by our mercy  we annihilated those who denied our signs and would not believe 
to the thamud we sent their brother salih he said   o my people  worship god  you have no other god but him a veritable proof has come to you from your lord  this is god s she camel  a sign for you  so let her feed in god s land and do not harm her in any way  or you will be overwhelmed by a painful punishment 
remember when he made you successors to the ad and settled you in the land you built palaces on its plains and carved houses out of the mountains remember god s blessings and do not spread corruption in the land  
but the arrogant leaders of his people said to the believers who were deemed weak   do you know for certain that salih is one sent from his lord   they replied   we believe in the message which has been sent through him  
the arrogant leaders said   we reject what you believe in  
so they hamstrung the she camel  and insolently defied the commandment of their lord  saying   o salih  bring upon us what you threaten us with if you are indeed a messenger  
so the earthquake overwhelmed them  and morning found them prostrate in their dwelling places 
he left them  saying   my people  i delivered my lord s messages to you and counselled you sincerely  but you do not like sincere advisors  
we sent lot  who said to his people   how can you commit an abomination such as no one in the world has ever done before you 
you lust after men rather than women  you transgress all bounds  
the only answer given by his people was   turn them out of your town they are people who regard themselves to be pure  
so we saved him and his family    except for his wife she was one of those who stayed behind 
we rained down on them a shower of brimstone then see what was the end of the evil doers 
to midian we sent their brother shu ayb he said   o my people  worship god  you have no other god but him a clear sign has indeed come to you from your lord so give full measure and full weight  and do not deliver short do not corrupt the land after it has been set in order this is for your own good  if you are true believers 
do not lie in ambush on every pathway  threatening people  barring those who believe from the way of god  seeking to make it appear crooked remember when you were few in number and he multiplied you consider the fate of those who used to spread corruption 
and if there is a group of you which believes in my message and others who disbelieve it  be patient until god shall judge between us he is the best of judges  
the arrogant leaders of his people said   shu ayb  we will expel you and your fellow believers from our town unless you return to our faith   he said   even though we detest it 
we would be inventing lies against god if we returned to your faith after god has delivered us from it it is not for us to return to it unless god our lord so willed our lord encompasses all things in his knowledge we have put our trust in god our lord  expose the truth and judge between us and our people  you are the best judge  
the leading men of his people who were bent on denying the truth  said   if you follow shu ayb  you will certainly be the losers  
thereupon an earthquake overtook them and morning found them lying flattened in their homes 
those who had denied shu ayb became as though they had never lived there those who denied shu ayb  were themselves the losers 
so he turned away from them  saying   my people  i delivered my lord s messages to you and gave you sincere advice  so why should i grieve for people who refused to believe  
whenever we sent a prophet to a town  we afflicted its people with suffering and adversity  so that they might humble themselves before god  
and then we changed their hardship into ease until they grew affluent and said   our fathers had also experienced adversity and prosperity   then we seized them suddenly  unawares 
had the people of those towns believed in and feared god  we would have showered upon them blessings from heaven and earth  but they rejected the truth so we seized them on account of their misdeeds 
do the people of these towns now feel secure against the coming of our punishment upon them by night while they are asleep 
or  do they feel secure against the coming of our punishment upon them in the forenoon while they are at play 
do they feel secure against god s devising no one feels secure against god s devising except for those doomed to ruin 
does it not guide the people who inherit the land from former people that we can punish them for their sins if we will and seal up their hearts so that they would not be able to lend an ear to words of guidance 
we have told you the stories of those towns  their messengers came to them with clear signs  but they were never going to believe in something they had already rejected thus god seals up the hearts of those who deny the truth 
we found most of them untrue to their covenants  indeed we found most of them to be defiant 
after them we sent moses with our signs to pharaoh and his chiefs but they willfully rejected them consider the end of the evil doers 
moses said   pharaoh  i am a messenger from the lord of the universe 
duty bound to say nothing about god but the truth  and i have brought you a clear sign from your lord let the children of israel go with me  
 pharaoh said   if you come with a sign  then produce it  if you are telling the truth  
then moses threw down his staff and suddenly  unmistakably  it appeared as a serpent 
and he drew forth his hand  and it appeared shining white to the beholders 
the chiefs of pharaoh s people said   this is most surely a skillful magician 
who seeks to drive you from your land   pharaoh said   what then do you advise  
they said   let him and his brother wait awhile  and send into the cities summoners 
who should bring to you every skillful magician  
and the magicians came to pharaoh and asked   shall we have a reward  if we should prevail  
pharaoh replied   certainly  and you shall also become my courtiers  
they said   moses  will you first throw  or shall we  
he said   you throw first    when they made their cast  they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck them with awe  for they showed a great feat of magic 
then we inspired moses  saying   throw down your staff   and it immediately swallowed up their false devices 
thus the truth prevailed and what they had produced came to nothing 
pharaoh and his men were defeated and utterly humiliated 
and the sorcerers prostrated themselves
and said   we believe in the lord of the universe 
the lord of moses and aaron  
pharaoh said   you dare believe in him before i have given you permission behold  this is indeed a plot which you have devised in this city in order to drive its people out but you shall soon know the consequences 
i will cut off your hands and feet on alternate sides and then crucify you all  
they replied   we shall surely return to our lord 
you would punish us only because we believed in the signs of our lord when they were shown to us our lord  pour patience upon us  and cause us to die in a state of submission to you  
the chiefs of pharaoh s people said   will you allow moses and his people to spread corruption in the land  and to forsake you and your gods   he replied   we shall kill their male children and spare only the females we have complete power over them  
moses said to his people   turn to god for help and be patient the earth belongs to god he gives it to those of his servants whom he chooses  and the future belongs to the god fearing  
they replied   we were being persecuted before you came to us  and we are still being persecuted   he said   your lord may well destroy your enemy and make you successors to the land then he will see how you conduct yourselves  
we afflicted pharaoh s people with shortages of food and famine so that they might take heed 
then when something good came to them  they said   it is our due      but when something bad came  they ascribed it as an ill omen to moses and those with him surely their evil fortune had been decreed by god  but most of them did not know this 
they said   whatever miracles you work to bewitch us  we will not believe in you  
then we afflicted them with storms  and locusts  and lice  and frogs  and blood  so many clear signs but they were steeped in arrogance  for they were a people given to sin 
whenever a plague struck them  they would say   moses  pray to your lord for us by virtue of the promise he has made to you  if you remove this plague from us  we will surely believe in you and let the children of israel go with you  
but whenever we removed the plague from them  giving them time to make good their promise  they would break their word 
so we exacted retribution from them and drowned them in the sea  because they rejected our signs and paid no heed to them 
we made the people who were considered weak inheritors of the eastern parts and western parts of the land which we had blessed thus your lord s good promise to the children of israel was fulfilled  because of their patience  and we destroyed all that pharaoh and his people had built and all that they had raised high 
we brought the children of israel across the sea and they came upon a people who were devoted to their idols they said   moses  give us a god just like the gods these people have   he said   you are indeed an ignorant people 
what they are engaged in is doomed to destruction and all their works are in vain  
he said   shall i seek a deity for you other than god  while it is he who has exalted you above all peoples 
we delivered you from pharaoh s people  who afflicted you with dreadful torment  slaying your male children and sparing only your daughters that was surely a great trial for you by your lord  
we appointed thirty nights for moses  then added ten more  the term set by his lord was fulfilled in forty nights moses said to his brother aaron   take my place among my people  act rightly and do not follow the way of those who spread corruption  
and when moses came at our appointed time and his lord spoke to him  he said   my lord  show yourself to me so that i may look at you   he replied   you cannot see me  but look at the mountain  if it remains firmly in its place  then only will you see me   and when his lord manifested himself on the mountain  he broke it into pieces and moses fell down unconscious and when he recovered  he said   glory be to you  i turn towards you  and i am the first to believe  
he replied   moses  i have chosen you of all mankind for my messages and my words hold fast to what i have given you  and be among the grateful  
and we wrote for him upon the tablets an admonition and details of all things  then bade him    hold fast to them  and command your people to follow them in their best sense soon i shall show you the home of the wicked 
i will turn away from my signs all those who are arrogant in the land without any right  so that even if they see all the signs they will not believe in them if they see the right path  they shall not walk upon it  but if they see the path of error  they shall choose it for their path  because they have given the lie to our signs and paid no heed to them 
the actions of those who denied our signs and the meeting of the hereafter will come to nothing    they shall be requited only  according to their deeds  
in his absence  the people of moses made a calf from their ornaments  an image which made a lowing sound could they not see that it did not speak to them or guide them in any way yet they took to worshipping it  they were evil doers 
when they were afflicted with remorse  and realized that they had indeed gone astray  they said   if our lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us  we shall be among the lost  
when moses returned to his people in anger and great sorrow  he said   what an awful sin you have committed in my absence did you want to hasten your lord s command   he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the head  pulling him towards himself aaron said   son of my mother  the people oppressed me and almost killed me do not give my enemies cause to gloat over me do not number me among the wrongdoers  
he said   my lord  forgive me and my brother and admit us to your mercy you are the most merciful of the merciful  
those who took to worshipping the calf will be afflicted by their lord s wrath  and be disgraced in the life of this world this is the way we requite those who invent falsehoods 
as for those who committed evils  and thereafter repented and believed  they shall find your lord forgiving and merciful 
when his anger had subsided  moses took up the tablets upon which was inscribed a pledge of guidance and mercy for those who fear their lord 
and moses chose from his people seventy men for our appointment when they were seized with violent quaking  he prayed   o my lord  if it had been your will  you could have destroyed both them and me long ago but would you destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us this is no more than your trial  by it you cause whom you will to stray  and you lead whom you will to the right path you are our protector forgive us  therefore  and have mercy on us  for you are the best of those who forgive 
grant us good things  both in this life and in the hereafter to you alone we turn   he replied   as for my punishment  i smite with it anyone i will but my mercy encompasses all things i shall prescribe it for those who do their duty  pay the zakat and who believe in our signs 
also for those who follow the messenger  the unlettered prophet they find described in the torah that is with them  and in the gospel  who commands them to do right and forbids them to do wrong  who makes good things lawful to them and bad things unlawful  who will relieve them of their burdens and of the shackles that weigh upon them those that believe in him and honour him  those that aid him and follow the light sent down with him  shall surely triumph  
say   people  i am god s messenger to you all  he has sovereignty over the heavens and the earth there is no god but him he ordains life and death  so believe in god and his messenger  the unlettered prophet who believes in god and his words follow him so that you may be rightly guided  
yet there is a group among the people of moses who guide with truth and act justly in accordance with it 
we divided them up into twelve tribes  each a whole community  and we revealed our will to moses  when his people asked for water  saying   strike the rock with your staff   twelve springs gushed from it and each tribe knew its drinking place we caused the clouds to draw their shadow over them and sent down for them manna and quails  saying   eat the good things we have given you   they did not wrong us  rather it was themselves they wronged 
when they were told   settle down in the town and eat wherever you wish in it  and pray for forgiveness and enter the gate in humility  we shall forgive you your sins and shall bestow further favours upon those who do good  
the transgressors among them substituted something else for the word they had been given so we sent them a punishment from heaven for their wrongdoing 
ask them about the town which was by the sea and what befell its people when they broke the sabbath on their sabbath the fish came to them near the surface  but on week days they never came near them    thus we tried them because of their disobedience 
when some of them asked   why do you admonish a people whom god is going to destroy or to afflict with a severe punishment   they answered   in order to be free from blame before your lord  and that they may perhaps fear him  
therefore when they forgot what they had been reminded of  we saved those who had tried to prevent the doing of evil and we meted out a severe punishment to the transgressors because they were rebellious 
and then  when they disdainfully persisted in doing what they had been forbidden to do  we said to them   be as apes  despised  
then your lord declared that  until the day of resurrection  he would send others against them to inflict terrible suffering on them your lord is swift in retribution  yet surely he is most forgiving and merciful 
we split them up into sections on the earth some of them are righteous while some of them are otherwise  and we tested them with blessings and misfortunes  so that they might return to the right path 
they were succeeded by generations who inherited the scripture and took to the fleeting gains of this world  saying   we shall certainly be forgiven   if there came to them similar fleeting gains again  they would take them was a pledge not taken from them  written in the scripture  that they would not say anything but the truth about god and they have studied whatever is in it surely the home of the hereafter is better for those who fear him will you not understand 
as for those who hold fast to the book and are steadfast in prayer  we shall not deny the righteous their reward 
when we suspended the mountain over them as if it were a canopy  and they thought it was going to fall down on them  we said   hold on firmly to what we have given you and remember what is in it  so that you may remain conscious of god  
when your lord brought forth offspring from the loins of the children of adam and made them bear witness about themselves  he said   am i not your lord   they replied   we bear witness that you are   this he did  lest you should say on the day of resurrection   we had no knowledge of that  
or lest you say   our forefathers associated others with god before our time  and we are only the descendants who came after them so are you going to destroy us for what those inventors of falsehood did  
we explain our signs in detail thus  so that perhaps they may return to us 
recite to them the tale of the man to whom we gave our signs  but who then cast them to one side and satan overtook him and he became one of those who went astray 
if it had been our will  we could have used these signs to exalt him  but instead he clung to the earth and followed his own desires  he was like a dog that pants whether you chase it away or leave it alone such are those who reject our signs tell them this story so that they may reflect 
how evil is the case of those who deny our signs they only wrong themselves 
anyone whom god guides has been rightly guided  while those he lets go astray will surely be the losers 
we created many of the jinn and mankind for hell they have hearts they do not understand with  they have eyes they do not see with  and they have ears they do not hear with such people are like cattle    no  they are even more misguided such are the heedless 
god has the most excellent names call on him by his names and keep away from those who distort them they shall be requited for what they do 
of those we have created there are some who give true guidance and act justly 
we shall gradually seize those who reject our signs from a place they do not recognize 
for though i give them rein for a while  my strategy is sure 
have they not reflected that their companion is not mad he is only a plain warner 
have they not looked into the realms of the heavens and the earth and all that god created  and seen that the end of their time might be near what will they believe in if they do not believe in this 
no one can guide those whom god lets go astray  he leaves them blundering about in their arrogance 
they ask you prophet about the last hour   when will it come   say   knowledge about it rests only with my lord  he alone will reveal when its time will come  it lies heavy on the heavens and the earth  it will suddenly overtake you   they will put questions to you as though you had full knowledge of it say   knowledge about it rests only with god  though most people do not realize it  
say   i myself have no power to benefit or do harm  save as god pleases if i had knowledge of the unseen  i would have availed myself of an abundance of good  and no harm would have touched me i am but a warner and a bearer of good tidings for those who will believe  
it was he who created you from a single soul  and from it made its mate so that he may find comfort in her once he has covered her  she conceives and goes about with a light burden when it grows heavy  they both call to god  their lord   if you bestow on us a healthy child  we will surely be grateful  
yet when he grants them a healthy child  they begin to ascribe to others a share in the gift they have received but god is far above what they associate with him 
do they associate with him those who create nothing and are themselves created 
they can give them no help  nor can they help themselves 
it makes no difference whether you call on them or remain silent if you call them to the right path  they will not follow you 
those whom you call on besides god are but creatures like yourselves call upon them  then  and let them respond to you  if what you say is true 
have they feet to walk with have they hands to hold with have they eyes to see with have they ears to hear with say   call upon those you associate with god as partners  then all of you contrive against me and give me no respite 
my protector is god who sent down the book  for it is he who protects the righteous 
those whom you call on besides him have no power to help you  nor can they help themselves  
if you call them to the right path  they will not hear you you find them looking towards you  but they do not see you 
be tolerant  enjoin what is right  and avoid the ignorant 
if an evil impulse from satan provokes you  seek refuge with god  he is all hearing  and all knowing 
when any evil suggestion from satan touches those who fear god  they are instantly alerted and become watchful 
but the followers of devils are led relentlessly into error by them they never desist 
when you do not bring them a sign  they say   why do you not invent one   say   i follow only what is revealed to me by my lord this book is an enlightenment from your lord and a guide and mercy to true believers 
when the quran is read  listen to it with attention  and hold your peace  so that you may receive mercy 
remember your lord deep in your very soul  in all humility and awe  without raising your voice  morning and evening  do not be one of the heedless 
 even the ones angels who live in the presence of your lord are not too proud to worship him  they glorify him and prostrate themselves before him 
they ask you about the spoils of war say   they belong to god and his messenger so fear god  and set things right among yourselves  and obey god and his messenger  if you are true believers 
true believers are those whose hearts tremble with awe at the mention of god  and whose faith grows stronger as they listen to his revelations they are those who put their trust in their lord 
who pray regularly and give in alms out of what we have provided for them 
such are the true believers they have a high standing with their lord  his forgiveness and an honourable provision made for them 
as it was your lord who rightfully brought you forth from your house  even though some of the believers disliked it 
and they disputed with you concerning the truth after it had become manifest  as though they were being driven to their death with open eyes 
god promised you that one of the two parties would fall to you  and you wished that the one without sting should be yours  but god wanted to establish the truth by his words and cut off the root of those who denied the truth   
so that he might prove the truth to be true and the false to be false  however much the wrongdoers might dislike it 
when you prayed to your lord for help  he answered   i am sending to your aid a thousand angels in succession  
god only did this to give you good news  and so that your hearts might be set at rest  for help comes from god alone surely  god is mighty and wise 
he brought drowsiness upon you to give you his reassurance and sent down water from the sky upon you  so that he might thereby purify you and remove satan s pollution from you  and make your hearts strong and your feet firm 
when your lord commanded the angels  saying   i am with you  so make those who believe stand firm i will instill fear in the hearts of those who deny the truth  so strike their necks and strike all their finger joints  
that was because they defied god and his messenger he who defies god and his messenger shall be severely punished by god 
that is your punishment  taste it then  and know that for those who deny the truth there is the punishment of the fire 
believers  when you meet in battle those who deny the truth  never turn your backs on them 
whoever turns his back on such an occasion  unless it be as a stratagem of war  or in an endeavour to join another group of the believers will indeed draw down upon himself the wrath of god  and hell shall be his abode and the worst indeed is that destination 
you did not kill them  it was god who killed them  and when you prophet threw sand at them it was not you  but god who threw it so that he might confer on the believers a great favour from himself surely  god is all hearing  all knowing 
that is what happened  and god will surely undermine the design of those who deny the truth 
if you were seeking a judgement  a judgement has now come to you if you desist  it will be the better for you but if you return to hostility we too will return and your host will avail you naught  however numerous it may be  and know that surely god is with the believers 
believers  obey god and his messenger  and do not turn away from him now that you have heard all 
do not be like those who say   we hear   but pay no heed to what they hear   
the worst creatures in god s eyes are those who are deaf and dumb  and who possess no understanding 
if god had found any good in them  he would certainly have made them hear  but being as they are  even if he makes them hear  they will turn away in aversion 
believers  obey god and the messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life know that god stands between man and his heart  and you shall all be gathered in his presence 
and beware of an affliction that will not smite exclusively those among you who have done wrong know that god is severe in exacting retribution 
remember when you were few in number and were accounted weak in the land  ever fearing the onslaught of your enemies  but he provided you with shelter  and supported you with his help and provided you with good things  so that you might be grateful 
do not betray god and his messenger  and do not knowingly violate your trusts 
know that your wealth and children are a trial and that there is an immense reward with god 
believers  if you fear god  he will grant you the ability to discriminate between right and wrong  and will forgive you your sins  for god is limitless in his great bounty 
remember how those who bent on denying the truth plotted against you to imprison you or kill you or expel you  they schemed    but god also schemed god is the best of schemers 
whenever our revelations are recited to them  they say   we have heard them if we wished  we could produce the like they are nothing but the fables of the ancients  
they also said   god  if this really is the truth from you  then rain down upon us stones from heaven  or send us some other painful punishment  
but god would not punish them while you prophet were in their midst  nor would he punish them so long as they sought forgiveness 
yet why should god not punish them when they debar people from the sacred mosque  although they are not its guardians its rightful guardians are those who fear god  though most of them do not realize it 
their prayers at the sacred house are nothing but whistling and clapping of hands  so taste the punishment because of your denial  
those who are bent on denying the truth are spending their wealth in debarring others from the path of god they will continue to spend it in this way till  in the end  this spending will become a source of intense regret for them  and then they will be overcome and those who denied the truth will be gathered together in hell 
so that god may separate the bad from the good  he will heap the wicked one upon another and then cast them into hell these will surely be the losers 
tell those who are bent on denying the truth that if they desist  their past shall be forgiven  but if they persist in sin  they have an example in the fate of those who went before 
fight them until there is no more religious persecution  and religion belongs wholly to god  if they desist  then surely god is watchful of what they do 
but if they turn away  know that god is your protector  the best of protectors and the best of helpers 
know that one fifth of your battle gains belongs to god and the messenger  to his close relatives and orphans  to the needy and travellers  if you believe in god and the revelation we sent down to our servant on the decisive day  the day when the two forces met god has power over all things 
you were on the nearer side of the valley  and they were on the farther side  and the caravan was below you had you wished to set a time by mutual agreement  you would certainly have disagreed on the timing however  the encounter took place  so that god might settle a matter which had already been ordained  so that he who was to perish might perish after clear evidence of the truth  and he who was to live might live in clear evidence of the truth surely  god is all hearing and all knowing 
god showed them to you in your dream as small in number if he had shown them to you as many  you would have lost heart and disputed about the matter  but god saved you he has full knowledge of what is in the human heart 
when at the time of your encounter he made them appear few in your eyes  and made you appear few in their eyes  it was so that god might bring about that which had been decreed everything returns to god 
believers  when you encounter a party  remain firm and remember god much  so that you may succeed 
obey god and his messenger  and avoid dissension  lest you falter and are no longer held in awe have patience  god is with those who are patient 
do not be like those who left their homes full of conceit and showing off to others they debar others from the path of god  but god has knowledge of all their actions 
satan made their deeds seem fair to them and said   none of the people shall prevail against you this day  i shall be your protector   but when the two forces came in sight of each other  he turned on his heels  saying   this is where i leave you  i see what you do not  and i fear god    god is severe in his punishment  
the hypocrites and those whose hearts were perverted said   these people the believers must be deluded by their religion   but he who places his trust in god knows that   god is almighty and wise 
if you could see  when the angels take the souls of those who are bent on denying the truth at death   how they strike their faces and backs  saying  taste the punishment of the burning 
this is the punishment for what your hands committed    for  god never does the least wrong to his servants  
like pharaoh s people and those that have gone before them  they rejected god s signs and god seized them for their sins god is strong  and severe in punishment 
god would never withdraw a favour that he had conferred upon a people unless they change what is in their hearts god is all hearing and all knowing 
like pharaoh s people and those who went before them  they denied their lord s signs  we destroyed them for their sins  and we drowned pharaoh s people    they were all evil doers 
the worst creatures in the sight of god are those who reject him and will not believe 
those with whom you have made a covenant  and who break their covenant on every occasion and have no fear of god 
should you encounter them in war  then deal with them in such a manner that those that follow them should abandon their designs and may take warning 
and if you learn of treachery on the part of any people  throw their treaty back at them  so as to be on equal terms  for god does not love the treacherous 
let not the deniers think that they will ever get away they cannot frustrate god s purpose they have not the power to do so 
prepare any strength you can muster against them  and any cavalry with which you can overawe god s enemy and your own enemy as well  and others besides them whom you do not know  but who are known to god anything you spend in the way of god will be repaid to you in full you will not be wronged 
then if they should be inclined to make peace  make peace with them  and put your trust in god surely  it is he who is all hearing and all knowing 
should they seek to deceive you  god is enough for you  it was he who strengthened you with his help  and rallied the faithful around you  and bound their hearts together 
even if you had spent all that is on the earth  you could not have bound their hearts together  but god has bound them together surely  he is mighty and wise 
o prophet  god is sufficient for you and the believers who follow you 
prophet  urge the believers to fight  if there are twenty of you who are steadfast  they will overcome two hundred  and if there are a hundred of you  they will overcome a thousand of those who deny the truth  for they are devoid of understanding 
god has now lightened your burden  for he knows that there is weakness in you if there are a hundred of you who are steadfast  they will overcome two hundred  and if there are a thousand of you  they will overcome two thousand by god s will god is with the steadfast 
it is not right for a prophet to keep captives unless he has battled strenuously in the land you desire the gain of this world  while god desires for you the hereafter    god is mighty and wise 
had it not been for a writ from god that had already gone forth  you would have been severely punished on account of what you took 
so eat of that which you have gained in war as lawful and good  and fear god surely  god is most forgiving and merciful 
prophet  tell those you have taken captive   if god knows of any good in your hearts  he will give you something better than what has been taken from you  and he will forgive you  god is forgiving and merciful  
and if they would betray you  they betrayed god before  and he gave you power over them god is aware and wise 
those who have believed and migrated and struggled for god s cause with their possessions and persons  and those who have given refuge and help  are the friends and protectors of one another but as for those who have come to believe without having migrated    you are in no way responsible for their protection until they migrate if they seek your help in the matter of religion  it is incumbent on you to help them  except against a people with whom you have a pact god sees what you do 
those who deny the truth support one another if you fail to do likewise  there will be great disorder and corruption in the land 
those who have believed and migrated and striven for the cause of god  as well as those who have given them refuge and support  are the true believers  they shall have forgiveness and an honourable provision 
and those who have believed later on  and emigrated and struggled for god s sake alongside you are also a part of you but as to blood relations  they are nearer one to another in the book of god god has full knowledge of all things 
this is a declaration of immunity from god and his messenger to the polytheists  with whom you had made agreements 
so go about in the land for four months  but know that you cannot frustrate the plan of god and that god will disgrace those who deny the truth 
this is a proclamation from god and his messenger to the people on the day of the pilgrimage  that god is free of all obligation to the polytheists  and so is his messenger if you repent  it will be better for you  but if you turn away  then know that you cannot frustrate the plan of god proclaim a grievous punishment to those who are bent on denying the truth 
as for those who have honoured the treaty you made with them and who have not supported anyone against you  fulfill your agreement with them to the end of their term god loves those who are righteous 
when the forbidden months have passed  kill the polytheists who are at war with you wherever you find them take them captive  and besiege them  and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush but if they repent  and take to prayer regularly and pay the alms  then let them go their way god is forgiving and merciful 
if any one of the polytheists seeks asylum with you  grant him asylum so that he may hear the word of god  then convey him to a place of safety that is because they are a people who have no knowledge 
how can there be a treaty with the polytheists on the part of god and his messenger  except for those with whom you entered into a treaty at the sacred mosque as long as they act straight with you  act straight with them god loves those who are righteous 
how can there be a treaty for  if they get the upper hand over you  they will respect neither kinship nor covenant they try to please you with their tongues but their hearts reject you  most of them are perfidious 
they have sold god s revelations for a paltry price  and barred others from his path how evil is what they have been doing 
where believers are concerned  they respect no tie of kinship or treaty they are people who overstep the limits 
if they repent and keep up their prayers and pay the alms  then they are your brethren in faith we make our messages clear for people who are willing to learn 
but if they break faith after pledging it and revile your religion  then fight these leaders of unbelief  so that they may desist  for they have no regard for their pledged word 
will you not fight against those who have broken their oaths and conspired to banish the messenger they were the first to attack you do you fear them surely god is more deserving of your fear  if you are true believers 
fight them  god will punish them at your hands  and will disgrace them he will help you to overcome them and heal the hearts of the faithful 
he will remove the rage from their hearts god will turn in his mercy to whom he wills god is all knowing and wise 
do you o believers think that you will be spared without god identifying which of you have struggled and did not take anyone for friends and protectors except god  his messenger  and the believers god is fully aware of all your actions 
it is not right that the polytheists should frequent god s places of worship while they are self confessed unbelievers it is they whose works shall come to nothing and they shall abide in hell 
only he should tend god s houses of worship who believes in god and the last day  and is constant in prayer  and spends in charity  and stands in awe of none but god  such people may hope to be among the rightly guided 
do you regard giving water to pilgrims and tending the sacred mosque as being equal to the deeds of those who believe in god and the last day and who strive in god s path they are not equal in the sight of god god does not guide such unjust people 
those who have believed and have migrated  and have striven for god s sake with their possessions and persons  stand much higher in god s esteem it is they who will triumph 
their lord gives them the good news of his mercy and his pleasure and gardens of eternal bliss 
there they will dwell for ever truly there is an immense reward with god 
believers  do not take your fathers and your brothers for allies if they choose denial of truth in preference to faith those among you who ally themselves with them are wrongdoers 
say   if your fathers and your sons and your brothers and your spouses and your tribe  and the worldly goods which you have acquired  and the commerce which you fear will decline  and the homes you love are dearer to you than god and his messenger and the struggle for his cause  then wait until god fulfills his decree god does not guide the disobedient people  
indeed  god has helped you on many occasions on the day of hunayn  when you took pride in your great numbers  they proved of no avail to you    for the earth  despite all its vastness  became too narrow for you and you turned back  in retreat 
god caused his tranquillity to descend upon his messenger and the faithful  and sent down forces which you did not see  he punished those who denied the truth  for such is the recompense of all who deny the truth 
then after that  god will turn in his mercy to whom he wills  god is forgiving and merciful 
believers  know that the polytheists are impure  so they should not approach the sacred mosque after this year onwards if you should fear destitution  god will enrich you out of his bounty  if he so wishes god is aware and wise 
fight those from among the people of the book who believe neither in god  nor in the last day  nor hold as unlawful what god and his messenger have declared to be unlawful  nor follow the true religion  until they pay the tax willingly and agree to submit 
the jews say   ezra is the son of god   and the christians say   the messiah is the son of god   these are but their baseless utterances they imitate the assertions made in earlier times by those who deny the truth may god destroy them  how far astray they have been led 
they have taken their learned men and their monks for their lords besides god so have they taken the messiah  son of mary  although they were commanded to worship only the one god there is no deity but he he is far above whatever they set up as his partners 
they want to extinguish god s light with their mouths  but god seeks only to perfect his light  no matter how those who deny the truth may abhor it 
it is he who has sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth  so that he may make it prevail ideologically over every other religion  however much the polytheists may hate this 
believers  many religious scholars and monks wrongfully appropriate people s possessions and turn people away from god s path  tell those who hoard gold and silver instead of giving in god s cause that they will have a painful punishment 
on the day their treasure is heated up in the fire of hell  their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded with it  and they will be told   this is what you hoarded up for yourselves taste then what you were hoarding  
on the day god created heaven and earth  he decreed that the number of months should be twelve in number out of these  four are sacred that is the true religion do not wrong your souls in these months fight the polytheists all together  as they fight you all together  and know that god is with the righteous 
the postponing of sacred months is but one more instance of their refusal to acknowledge the truth    by which those who are bent on denying the truth are led astray they declare this to be permissible in one year and forbidden in another year  so that they may adjust the months which god has sanctified  thus making lawful what god has forbidden their evil deed seems fair to them  god does not guide those who deny the truth 
believers  what is the matter with you that when you are asked to go forth in the cause of god  you cling slothfully to the land do you prefer the life of this world to the hereafter but little is the comfort of this life  compared to that of the hereafter 
if you do not go forth  he will punish you sternly and replace you by other people you will not harm him in the least god has power over all things 
if you do not support him muhammad   know that god did support him when those who denied the truth expelled him when the two of them were in the cave  he muhammad told his companion   do not worry  for god is with us   so god sent his tranquillity down on him and aided him with forces invisible to you and placed the word of those who disbelieved lowest  while god s word remained supreme god is powerful and wise 
go forth  whether lightly or heavily equipped  and strive and struggle  with your goods and your persons  for the cause of god that is better for you  if you only knew 
had the gain been immediate and the journey shorter  they would have followed you  but the distance seemed too great for them yet they will swear by god   had we been able  we would have gone out with you   they bring ruin upon themselves god knows that they are surely lying 
may god pardon you  why did you permit them to do so before it had become clear to you which ones were truthful  so that you might recognize the liars 
those who believe in god and the last day will never ask you to exempt them from striving with their wealth and their lives  god best knows the righteous 
only those seek exemption who do not truly believe in god and the last day  and whose hearts have become a prey to doubt because they doubt  they waver 
if they had wished to go forth  they would surely have made some preparation for it  but god disliked their setting out and being raised high in god s eyes and held them back they were told to stay behind with those who stay behind 
had they gone forth with you  they would only have proved a source of evil for you  and would have run back and forth among you  seeking to sow discord among you  and among you there were some who would have willingly listened to them god knows the evil doers 
they have already tried to sow dissension  and hatched plots against you  until the truth became manifest and god s will prevailed  much to their disgust 
some of them say   give us leave to stay behind and do not put us to trial   surely  they have already fallen into trial surely  hell shall engulf those who deny the truth 
if good befalls you  it grieves them  but if a misfortune befalls you  they say   we took our precautions beforehand   they turn away rejoicing 
say   nothing can befall us  except what god has ordained for us he is our supreme lord in god let the faithful put their trust  
say   are you waiting for anything to befall us except one of the two best things victory in this world or paradise in the next but we expect that god will send his punishment to you either directly from himself  or by our hands so wait  if you will  we too  are waiting with you  
say   whether you give willingly or unwillingly  your offerings shall not be accepted by god  for you are indeed a disobedient people  
the only reason their contributions are not accepted is that they have denied god and his messenger  they come to the prayer half heartedly  and they offer contributions unwillingly 
do not let their wealth and children impress you for god seeks to punish them through these things in the life of this world  so that their souls shall depart while they are still denying the truth 
they swear by god that they are believers like you  but they are not they are afraid to appear in their true colours  
if they could find a place of refuge  or a cave or any hiding place  they would run there with frantic haste 
among them there are some who find fault with you concerning the distribution of alms if a share is given to them  they are pleased  but if they receive nothing  they grow resentful 
if only they had been content with what god and his messenger had given them and had said   god is sufficient for us god will give us out of his bounty  and so will his messenger to god alone do we turn with hope  
alms are only for  the poor and the destitute  for those who collect zakat  for conciliating people s hearts  for freeing slaves  for those in debt  for spending for god s cause  and for travellers in need it is a legal obligation enjoined by god god is all knowing and wise 
among them are those who vex the prophet by saying   he listens to everyone   say   his listening to everyone is good for you  he believes in god and puts his trust in the faithful  and is a mercy to those of you who believe those who annoy god s messenger shall have a painful punishment  
they swear by god in order to please you believers   but it would be more fitting for them to please god and his messenger  if they are believers 
do they not know that whoever opposes god and his messenger shall abide forever in the fire of hell that is the supreme humiliation 
the hypocrites are afraid lest a chapter of the quran be sent down about them  telling them what is in their hearts    say   go on mocking god will surely bring to light what you are dreading  
if you ask them  they will say   we were only joking and playing with words   say   would you make a mockery of god and of his revelations and of his messenger 
make no excuses  you rejected the faith after you accepted it   if we pardon some of you  we will punish others amongst you  for they are guilty 
the hypocrites  both men and women  are all alike they enjoin what is evil  forbid what is right and they are niggardly when it comes to spending for the cause of god they have forgotten god  so he has forgotten them the hypocrites are the disobedient ones 
god has promised the hypocrites  both men and women  and those who deny the truth  the fire of hell they shall abide in it forever that is a sufficient recompense for them god has rejected them they shall have everlasting punishment 
like those before you who were stronger than you  possessed more wealth and children  they enjoyed their share in this life as you have enjoyed yours  like them  you have indulged in idle talk it is they whose works shall come to nothing in this world and in the life to come    and it is they who shall be the losers 
have they never heard the stories about their predecessors  the peoples of noah  ad  thamud  abraham  midian  and of the ruined cities their messengers brought them clear evidence of the truth it was not god who wronged them  they wronged themselves 
the believers  both men and women  are friends to each other  they enjoin what is good and forbid evil  they attend to their prayers and pay the alms and obey god and his messenger on these god will have mercy  for god is almighty and wise 
god has promised the believers  both men and women  gardens through which rivers flow  wherein they will abide  and fine dwelling places in gardens of eternity but the good pleasure of god is greater still that is the supreme achievement 
o prophet  strive against those who deny the truth and the hypocrites  and be firm against them their abode shall be hell  an evil destination 
they swear by god that they did not  yet they uttered the words of denial of truth after they had accepted islam they meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out  and being spiteful was their only response to god  who had enriched them out of his bounty  and to his messenger if they repent  it will indeed be better for them if they turn away  god will punish them with grievous suffering in this world and the hereafter  and there will be no one on earth to protect or help them 
there are some among them who pledged themselves to god  saying   if god gives us something out of his bounty  we shall certainly give alms and be righteous  
but when he bestowed his favours on them they grew niggardly  and turned away in aversion 
so he caused hypocrisy to settle in their hearts until the day of their meeting with him  because they broke their word to god  and because they lied 
do they not know that god knows what they conceal and what they talk about in secret that god knows all that is hidden 
as for those who ridicule such believers as give alms freely for the sake of god and taunt those who find nothing to give save that which they earn through their toil  god will cause their ridicule to rebound on them  they shall have a painful punishment 
it is the same whether or not you ask forgiveness for them even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times  god will not forgive them  for they have denied god and his messenger god does not guide the evil doers 
those who stayed at home were glad that they were left behind by god s messenger they hated the thought of striving for god s cause with their possessions and their persons they said   do not go forth in this heat   say   the fire of hell is far hotter   if only they could understand 
let them laugh a little and weep much in return for their misdeeds 
so prophet   if god brings you back to a group of them  and should they ask your leave to go forth with you  say   you shall never go forth with me and shall never fight an enemy with me you chose to sit at home the first time  so sit now with those who remain behind  
and never o muhammad pray for one of them who dies  nor stand by his grave for they denied god and his messenger  and died rebellious 
do not let their wealth and their children dazzle you god only wants to punish them through these things in this world  and let their souls depart while they deny the truth 
when a chapter is revealed enjoining   believe in god and strive for the cause of god along with his messenger   the wealthy among them ask you to exempt them saying   let us stay with those who are to stay behind  
they preferred to be with the women   who remained behind at home   their hearts are sealed and so they do not understand 
but the messenger and those who shared his faith strove hard with their possessions and their lives it is they who shall have all kinds of good  and it is they who shall surely prosper 
god has prepared for them gardens through which rivers flow  in which they shall abide forever that is the supreme triumph 
some of the desert arabs  too  came to make excuses  asking to be granted exemption those who lied to god and his messenger stayed behind at home those who denied the truth among them will be afflicted with a painful chastisement 
but no blame shall attach to the weak  the sick  and those who have no means to spend  provided they are sincere to god and his messenger there is no reason to reproach those who do good deeds  god is most forgiving and merciful 
nor does any blame attach to those who came to you to be provided with mounts  and when you said   i can find no mounts for you   they went back  and tears welled up in their eyes with sadness  since they could not find any way to contribute 
the blameworthy are those who are men of wealth and yet ask for exemption they are content to be with those women who stay behind god has sealed their hearts  they do not understand 
they will make excuses to you when you return to them say   do not make excuses  we will not believe you god has already informed us about you god will see your actions  as will his messenger then you will be returned to the one who knows the seen and the unseen and he will tell you all that you used to do  
when you return  they will swear to you by god so that you may leave them alone  so leave them alone they are unclean  and hell will be their home as a reward for their actions   
they will swear to you  so that you may be pleased with them but even if you are pleased with them  god is not pleased with rebellious people 
the desert arabs are more stubborn in their denial of truth and hypocrisy  and are the least likely to be aware of the limits which god has revealed to his messenger god is all knowing and wise 
some desert arabs regard what they give for the cause of god as a fine and wait for some misfortune to befall you may ill fortune befall them  god hears all and knows all 
there are also those among them who believe in god and the last day and regard what they spend for the cause of god as a means of bringing them nearer to god and of deserving the prayers of the messenger this shall certainly be for them a means of drawing near to god god will admit them into his mercy  god is indeed most forgiving and merciful 
as for those who led the way  the first of the emigrants and the supporters  as well as those who nobly followed them  god is well pleased with them  and they are well pleased with him  he has prepared for them gardens through which rivers flow  where they shall dwell forever that is the supreme achievement 
some of the desert arabs around you are hypocrites as are some of the people of madinah    they are obdurate in their hypocrisy you do not know them  but we know them we shall cause them to suffer doubly and then they will be subjected to a great punishment 
there are others who have confessed their wrongdoing  who have done some good deeds and some bad ones it is likely that god will turn to them in mercy surely  god is most forgiving  merciful 
take alms out of their wealth to cleanse them and purify them  and pray for them  your prayer will be a comfort to them god is all hearing  all knowing 
do they not know that god accepts the repentance of his servants and receives their alms  and that god is the forgiving  the merciful one 
say   do as you will god will watch your conduct and so will his messenger and the believers soon you will be brought back to him who knows what is hidden and what is manifest  then he will show you the truth of all that you have done  
 there are yet others whose cases are deferred until it is god s will to judge them he will either punish them  or turn in mercy to them  god is all knowing and wise 
then there are those who built a mosque to cause harm  to spread apostasy and disunity among the believers    as an outpost for those who from the outset warred on god and his messenger they swear   our intentions were nothing but good   but god bears witness that they are lying 
do not set foot in it only a house of worship  founded from the very first day upon piety  is worthy of your setting foot therein in it are men who love to be purified and god loves those who purify themselves 
who is better  he who founds his building on the fear of god and his good pleasure  or he who builds on the brink of a crumbling precipice  so that his house is ready to fall with him into the fire of hell god does not guide the wrongdoers 
the building which they have built will never cease to be a source of deep disquiet in their hearts  until their hearts are cut to pieces god is all knowing and wise 
god has bought from the believers their lives and their wealth in return for the garden they fight for the cause of god and they kill and are killed it is a promise binding on him in the torah  the gospel and the quran  and who is truer to his promise than god rejoice then in the bargain you have made that is the supreme achievement 
 the believers are those who turn to god in repentance  who worship and praise him  who go about in the land serving his cause  who bow down  who prostrate themselves  who enjoin good and forbid evil  and who observe the limits set by god give good news to the believers 
it is not proper for the prophet and those who believe to seek forgiveness for polytheists  even though they are close relatives  after it has become clear to them that they have earned the punishment of hell 
abraham s asking forgiveness for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him  but when it became clear to him  that he was god s enemy  he disassociated himself from him surely  abraham was most tender hearted and forbearing 
god would never lead a people astray after he has guided them and until he has made clear to them what they should guard against god has knowledge of all things 
surely to god belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth he gives life and death you have none besides god to protect or help you 
god turned in mercy to the prophet  and the emigrants and the helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship after the hearts of a group of them had almost faltered  he turned towards them  for he was compassionate and merciful towards them 
he has turned with mercy to the three whose case was deferred  when the earth  for all its spaciousness  closed in upon them  and their own souls seemed straitened to them and they realised that there was no refuge from god except in him he turned to them so that they might turn to him god is the ever forgiving  the most merciful 
believers  fear god and stand with the truthful 
it was not proper for the people of madinah and those desert arabs around them to hold back from following god s messenger  and to prefer their own lives to his life this is because whenever they suffer from thirst or weariness or hunger for god s cause  and whenever they take any step which provokes those who deny the truth  or inflicts any loss upon the enemy  it shall be counted as a good deed in the sight of god  god will not deny the righteous their reward 
and whenever they spend anything for the sake of god   be it little or much  and whenever they traverse the land in god s cause    it is recorded to their credit  and god will grant them the best reward for all that they have been doing 
it is not right that all the believers should go out in time of war all together why  then  does not a party from every group come to the prophet in order to acquire a deeper knowledge of religion and to warn their people  so that they can guard themselves against evil 
believers  fight against those deniers of the truth who are near you deal firmly with them know that god is with those who fear him 
whenever a chapter is sent down  there are some of them who say   which of you has had his faith increased by it   but  as for those who believe  it increases their faith and they rejoice 
but as for those with sickness in their hearts  it adds defilement to their defilement and they die in a state of denial of truth 
do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice yet they do not repent  nor would they be admonished 
whenever a chapter is revealed  they glance at each other  asking   is anyone watching   then they turn away god has turned their hearts away  because they are people who do not understand 
there has come to you a messenger of your own your suffering distresses him  he is deeply concerned for your welfare and full of kindness and mercy towards the believers 
but if they turn away  say   god suffices me  there is no deity but he  in him i have put my trust he is the lord of the glorious throne  
alif lam ra these are the verses of the book of wisdom 
does it seem strange to people that we have sent revelation to a man from among themselves  saying   warn mankind and give glad tidings to the believers that they have a true rank of honour with their lord   those who deny the truth say   this man is clearly a sorcerer  
truly  your lord is god who created the heavens and the earth in six days periods   then he ascended the throne  disposing the whole affair no one may intercede with him save with his permission such is god  your lord  so worship him alone will you not take heed 
to him you shall all return god s promise is true  he originates creation  then he restores it  so that he may reward with justice those who believe and do good works those who have denied the truth shall have boiling water to drink  and a painful punishment  because of their denial 
it is he who made the sun radiate a brilliant light and the moon shed its lustre  and ordained for it stages so that you may learn to count out the years and to make other such reckoning of time god has not created all these without a purpose he makes plain his revelations to men of understanding 
in the alternation of night and day  and in all that god has created in the heavens and the earth  there are signs for a god fearing people 
those who entertain no hope of meeting us  being pleased and contented with the life of this world  and those who give no heed to our signs 
shall have their abode in the fire in requital for their deeds 
those who believe and do good deeds will be guided by their lord because of their faith rivers shall flow at their feet in the gardens of bliss 
in that state of happiness they will call out   glory be to you  o god    while their greeting in it will be   peace   and the close of their call will be   all praise is due to god  the lord of the universe  
had god hastened the punishment of men as he hastens the good  the end of their term of life would already have been reached we leave those who do not hope to meet us groping along in their arrogance 
whenever any trouble befalls a person  he prays to us all the time  lying on his side  sitting or standing  but when we remove his trouble  he goes on his way as if he had never prayed to us for the removal of his trouble thus it is that the doings of the transgressors are made to look fair to them 
and indeed  before your time we destroyed whole generations when they persistently did evil  their messengers came to them with clear signs  but they would not believe thus we requite the guilty 
then we made you their successors in the land  so that we might observe how you would conduct yourselves 
when our clear revelations are recited to them  those who do not expect to meet us say   bring us a different quran  or make some changes in it   say   it is not for me to change it of my own accord i follow only what is revealed to me i fear  if i were to disobey my lord  the punishment on a dreadful day  
say   if god had so wished  i would not have recited it to you  nor would he have brought it to your knowledge indeed  i have spent a whole lifetime among you before it came to me how can you not use your reason  
who is more unjust than the man who invents a falsehood about god or denies his signs surely  the guilty shall never prosper 
instead of god they worship what neither harms nor benefits them  and they say   these are our intercessors with god   say   do you inform god about something in heavens and on earth that he does not know glory be to him  may he be exalted over whatever they associate with him   
mankind was only one community  but then they differed  and had it not been for a prior word from your lord  their differences would have been settled for them 
they ask   why has no sign been sent down to him from his lord   tell them   god alone has knowledge of the unseen so wait  i too will wait with you  
whenever we let mankind taste mercy after some adversity has afflicted them  they forthwith turn to devising false arguments against our signs say   god is swifter in his devising  our angels are recording your intrigues  
it is god who enables you to travel on land and sea and when you are sailing on ships and rejoicing in the favourable wind  a storm arrives  and the waves surge upon those on board from every side and they think they are encompassed  then they make a fervent appeal to god  saying in all sincerity   if you deliver us from this  we will surely be of the thankful  
but when he has delivered them  they begin  wrongfully to commit excesses in the land o you men  your excesses only affect your own selves have the enjoyment of the present life then to us you shall return  and we will inform you of all that you have done 
the life of the world is like the water which we send down from the sky  and which is absorbed by the plants of the earth  from which men and cattle eat but when the earth has taken on its finest appearance  and looks beautiful  and its people think they have it under their control  then by day or by night  our command comes to it and we convert it into a field of stubble  as if nothing had existed there the day before thus we make plain our revelations for those who reflect 
god calls man to the home of peace and he guides whom he wills to a straight path 
those who do good works shall have a good reward and more besides no darkness and no ignominy shall cover their faces they are destined for paradise wherein they shall dwell forever 
but as for those who have done evil deeds  the recompense shall be in proportion they will have none to defend them against god ignominy shall cover them  as though their faces were veiled by the night s own darkness it is they who are destined for the fire  where they will live forever 
on the day when we gather them all together  we shall say to those who ascribed partners to god   keep to your places  you and your partners   then we shall separate them from one another and their partner gods will say   it was not us that you worshipped 
god suffices as a witness between us and you we were entirely unaware that you worshipped us  
then every soul shall realize what it has done they shall be returned to god  their true master  and anything they had invented will forsake them 
say   who provides sustenance for you from heaven and earth who is it who controls the ears and the eyes who brings forth the living from the dead  and the dead from the living and who governs all affairs   they will say   god  then say   will you not then fear him 
that is god  your true lord what is there  besides the truth  but error how then can you turn away  
thus the word of your lord is proved true against those who are disobedient they will not believe 
ask then   can any of your partner gods originate creation  and then reproduce it   say   it is god who originates creation and then restores it  how then are you so misled  
say   does any of your partner gods guide one to the truth   say   it is god who guides to the truth then  is he who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed or one who cannot find the way himself unless he be guided what is the matter with you how ill you judge  
most of them follow nothing but mere conjecture but conjecture is of no use against the truth god is well aware of what they do 
this quran is not such as could have been produced by anyone but god it fulfills that the predictions which came before it and gives a fuller explanation of the earlier revelations there is no doubt about it  it is from the lord of the universe 
do they say   he has fabricated it   say   bring me one chapter like it call on whom you may besides god to help you  if what you say be true  
indeed  they are denying something which they cannot comprehend  the reality not yet having dawned on them likewise those before them rejected the truth but see what was the end of the wrongdoers 
some of them will believe in it the quran   while others will not and your lord is fully aware of the evil doers 
if they should reject you  say   my deeds are mine and your deeds are yours you are not accountable for my actions  nor am i accountable for what you do  
some of them appear to be listening to you  but can you make the deaf hear  incapable as they are of understanding 
some of them look fixedly at you  but can you make the blind see  bereft as they are of sight 
surely  god does not wrong people at all  but people wrong themselves 
and on the day when he shall gather them together  it will seem to them as if they had not tarried in the world longer than an hour of a day they will recognize one another  lost indeed will be those who considered it a lie that they were destined to meet god  and did not follow the right path 
whether we show you something of what we have promised them or cause you to die before that   to us they shall return god is witness to all that they do 
every nation has a messenger once their messenger has come  judgement will be passed upon them in all fairness and they will not be wronged 
they say   when will this promise come to pass    if you speak the truth  
say   i have no control over any harm or benefit to myself  except by the will of god for every people  however  there is an appointed term when the end of their term arrives  they cannot postpone it for an hour  nor can they advance it  
say   if his punishment comes upon you in the dead of night  or by the light of day  how will the guilty escape it 
will you believe in it only after it has overtaken you  although it was your wish to hurry it on  
then the evil doers will be told   taste the everlasting punishment have you not been rewarded according to your deeds  
they enquire of you if this will really happen tell them   yes  by my lord most certainly it will happen  and you cannot avert it  
if every wrongdoer possessed all that was on the earth  he would seek to ransom himself with it  when they see the punishment  they will repent in secret but judgement will be passed upon them in all fairness  and they will not be wronged 
assuredly  everything that is in the heavens and on the earth belongs to god assuredly  god s promise is true yet most of them do not realize it 
he gives life and brings about death  and to him you shall all return 
o mankind  there has come to you an admonition from your lord  a cure for what is in the hearts  and a guide and a blessing to true believers 
say   in the grace and mercy of god let them rejoice  for these are better than the worldly riches which they hoard  
say   have you considered the provision god has sent down for you  and have you made some of it unlawful and some lawful   say   has god given you permission to do this   or are you inventing falsehoods about god  
what will they think  those who invent falsehoods about god  on the day of resurrection god is bountiful to men  yet most of them are not grateful 
in whatever activity you may be engaged  and whichever part of the quran you recite  and whatever deed you do  we are witness to it when you are engaged in it not the smallest particle on the earth or in heaven is hidden from your lord  and there is nothing smaller or bigger but is recorded in a clear book 
those who are close to god shall certainly have no fear  nor shall they grieve 
for those who believe and are mindful of god 
there is good news in this life and in the hereafter  the word of god shall never change that is the supreme triumph 
do not let their words grieve you surely  all might and glory belongs to god alone  he is the all hearing  the all knowing 
surely  all who are in the heavens and on the earth belong to him what do those follow  who appeal to associates instead of to god they merely follow conjecture and they are only guessing 
it is he who has made the night dark for you so that you may rest in it  and the day a source of light surely  there are signs in this for a people who listen 
they say   god has begotten a son   glory be to him he is the self sufficient one  everything in the heavens and on the earth belongs to him do you have any authority for this would you ascribe to god something which you do not know 
say   those who invent falsehoods about god shall not prosper  
their portion is short lived enjoyment in this world  but to us they shall return then we shall make them taste a severe punishment  because of their denial of truth 
tell them the story of noah he said to his people   my people  if my presence among you and my preaching to you of god s revelations offends you  know that i put my trust in god  so agree on your course of action  along with your partner gods  and let no hesitation deflect you from it  then put it into effect against me  and give me no respite 
if you turn away from me  remember i demand no recompense from you only god will reward me and i have been commanded to submit completely to him  
then they rejected him  then we delivered him and those with him in the ark  and we made them successors  while we drowned the others who belied our signs observe then the fate of those who had been forewarned 
after him we sent other messengers to their respective peoples  and they brought them clear proofs but they would not believe in the truth  because they had rejected it before thus we seal up the hearts of the transgressors 
then we sent forth moses and aaron with our signs to pharaoh and his nobles  but they behaved arrogantly  for they were wicked people 
when the truth came to them from us  they said   this is plain sorcery  
moses replied   do you speak thus of the truth after it has been brought to you can this be sorcery sorcerers never prosper  
they said   have you come to turn us away from what we found our forefathers following  so that the two of you might become supreme in this land we will never believe in you  
then pharaoh said   bring me every skilled magician  
when the magicians came  moses said to them   cast down whatever you are going to cast down  
and when they had done so  moses said   what you have wrought is mere sorcery surely  god will bring it to nothing truly  god does not support the work of mischief makers 
god establishes the truth by his words  however much the sinners may dislike it  
but none save a few youths declared their faith in moses  while others held back for fear that pharaoh and his nobles would persecute them pharaoh was high and mighty in the land and one who transgressed all bounds 
moses said   o my people  if you believe in god  and if you have surrendered yourselves to him  then in him alone put your trust  
they said   in god we put our trust our lord  make us not a trial the subject of persecution for the oppressors 
and deliver us by your mercy from the people who deny the truth  
we revealed our will to moses and his brother  saying   set aside for your people some houses in the city and turn them into places of worship  and be constant in prayer  and give o moses the good news to the believers  
moses prayed   our lord  you have bestowed upon pharaoh and his nobles pomp and wealth in the present life  whereby they lead people astray from your path our lord  destroy their riches and harden their hearts  so that they shall not believe until they are faced with grievous punishment  
god said   your prayer is granted  so continue  then  both of you  steadfastly on the right path  and do not follow the path of those who have no knowledge  
so we brought the children of israel across the sea pharaoh and his troops pursued them arrogantly and aggressively when he was about to drown  pharaoh exclaimed   i believe that there is no deity save him in whom the children of israel believe  and i am of those who surrender themselves to him  
only now when you had always been a rebel  and a wrongdoer 
so we shall save your body this day  so that you may serve as a sign for those who come after you  for many people are indeed heedless of our signs  
we settled the children of israel in a blessed land  and we provided them with good things and it was not until knowledge of god s revelation was granted to them that they began to hold divergent views your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that in which they differed 
if you are in any doubt concerning what we have sent down to you  then question those who have read the book before you  the truth has come to you from your lord  so do not be one of the doubters   
do not be one who rejects god s signs  for then you would become one of the losers 
those against whom your lord s word has been confirmed will never believe 
not even if every sign were to come to them    until they see the painful punishment 
why was there no other people  save the people of jonah  who should have believed so that their belief would have benefited them once they believed  we lifted the torment of shame from them during their worldly life and let them enjoy our provision for a while 
had your lord pleased  all the people on earth would have believed in him  without exception so will you compel people to become believers 
no soul can believe except by the will of god he will place the filth of doubt upon those who do not use their reason 
say   look at whatever exists in heavens and on earth   but signs and warnings do not benefit the unbelievers 
what can they be waiting for but the punishment that came to those before them say   so wait  i am one of those waiting with you  
then we shall save our messengers and those who believe thus we have made it incumbent upon ourself to save the believers 
say   o people  if you are in doubt concerning my religion  then know that i do not worship those whom you worship instead of god  but rather i worship god who will cause you to die  for i am commanded to be one of the believers  
and set your face towards the true faith in all uprightness  and do not be one of those who ascribe partners to god 
and do not invoke besides god what can neither help nor harm you if you do  you will be one of the wrongdoers 
if god inflicts harm on you  no one can remove it but he  and if he intends good for you  no one can withhold his bounty  he grants his bounty to any of his servants whom he will he is the most forgiving  and the most merciful 
say   mankind  truth has come to you from your lord  anyone who accepts guidance is guided only for his own sake  and he who goes astray does so at his own peril i am not appointed as your keeper  
follow what is revealed to you  o prophet   and be steadfast until god gives his judgement he is the best of judges 
alif lam ra this is a book  with verses which are fundamental in nature   and then expounded in detail by one who is all wise and all aware 
 it teaches that you should worship none but god i am sent to you from him to warn you and to give you good tidings 
seek forgiveness from your lord  then turn towards him in repentance he will make generous provision for you for an appointed term and will bestow his grace on all who merit it  but if you turn away  then i fear for you the torment of a dreadful day 
to god you shall all return  and he has power over all things 
see how they cover themselves up to hide their thoughts from him but when they cover themselves up with their garments  he knows what they hide and what they reveal he knows their innermost thoughts 
there is not a living creature on the earth but it is for god to provide its sustenance he knows its dwelling and its final resting place all this is recorded in a clear book 
enthroned above the waters  it was he who created the heavens and the earth in six days periods   in order to test which of you is best in conduct if you say   you will all be raised up after death   those who deny the truth will say   this is just sheer sorcery  
if we defer their punishment till an appointed time  they ask   what is holding it back   on the day when it overtakes them  there will be nothing to avert it from them  and what they used to mock at shall encompass them 
when we bestow upon man a measure of our grace and then take it away from him  he yields to despair and becomes ungrateful 
and if  after adversity  we let him taste good fortune he says   all my ills are gone   he becomes exultant and boastful 
not so those who are patient and do good deeds they shall have forgiveness and a great reward 
you may feel the inclination to leave aside a part of what is revealed to you and you may be distressed because they say   why has no treasure been sent down to him  why has no angel come with him   but you are only to give warning god is the guardian of all things 
if they say   he has invented it himself   say   if you are truthful  produce ten invented chapters like it  and call on whom you can besides god  to help you  
but if they do not respond to you  then know that this quran is sent down with god s knowledge and that there is no deity but him will you then surrender yourselves to him 
those who desire the life of this world and all its finery shall be repaid in full in this life for their deeds    nothing shall be denied them 
these are the people who  in the world to come  shall have nothing but hellfire and all that they used to do shall be in vain 
can they be compared to those who possess a clear proof from their lord  followed up by a witness from him  preceded by the book of moses  as a guide and a mercy these people believe in it  whereas those groups that deny its truth are promised the fire therefore  have no doubt about it it is the truth from your lord  but most people do not believe it 
who does greater wrong than the one who fabricates a lie against god such people shall be brought before their lord  and the witnesses will say   these are the ones who lied about their lord   surely god s rejection is merited by such wrongdoers 
such as those who turn others away from the path of god and seek to make it appear crooked  these are the ones who deny the hereafter 
they can never frustrate god on earth  nor have they any protectors besides god they will be subjected to double punishment  for they could neither hear nor see 
it is such as these who have ruined their souls  and that which they fabricated shall fail them 
in the hereafter  it is they who shall be the greatest losers 
those who have believed and done good deeds and humbled themselves before their lord are destined for paradise  and they will live in it forever 
these two groups are like the blind and the deaf as compared with those who can see and hear can the two be equal will you not then understand 
we sent noah to his people he said   i have come to you with a clear warning 
worship none but god i fear lest punishment befall you on a woeful day  
the leaders of his people  who refused to acknowledge the truth  said   we regard you only as a human being like ourselves we do not see that anyone follows you but the lowliest of us  those of immature judgement we see no superior merit in you  in fact we believe you are a liar  
he said   o my people  tell me  if i have clear evidence from my lord and he has favoured me with grace from himself  which you have been unable to recognize  can we force it on you against your will 
o my people  i do not ask you for any money for this  my reward comes only from god i will not drive away those who believe  they shall surely meet their lord yet i see that you are a people who act out of ignorance 
my people  who would support me against god if i were to drive them off will you not take heed 
i do not say to you that i possess god s treasures  or that i have knowledge of the unseen  or that i am an angel nor do i say concerning those upon whom you look with contempt  that god will not bestow any good upon them    god knows best what is in their hearts if i did  i would certainly be one of the wrongdoers  
noah  they replied   you have argued with us  and argued to excess now bring down upon us what you threaten us with  if you speak the truth   
he said   it is god who will bring it down upon you  if he wishes  and you will not be able to escape 
my advice will not benefit you  no matter how sincerely i want to advise you  if god lets you go astray he is your lord and you will all return to him  
if they say   he has invented it himself   say to them   if i have indeed invented this myself  then may i be punished for my sin  i am innocent of the crimes that you commit  
god s will was revealed to noah   no more of your people will believe in you than those who already believe  do not grieve  therefore  over what they have been doing 
build the ark under our eyes and in accordance with our revelation do not plead with me concerning the evil doers they shall certainly be drowned  
so he began to build the ark  and whenever leaders of his people passed by  they scoffed at him he said   if you are scoffing at us  we shall scoff at you and your ignorance   just as you scoff at us 
you will soon come to know who will receive a humiliating punishment  and find unleashed against him an everlasting punishment  
when our command came  and water gushed forth in torrents  we said to noah   take into the ark a pair from every species  and your own family    except those on whom the sentence has already been passed  and all the true believers   but only a few believed along with him 
noah said   embark on it in the name of god  it shall set sail and cast anchor truly  my lord is forgiving and merciful  
the ark sailed along with them through mountainous waves noah called out to his son who stood apart   o my son  embark with us and do not be among the deniers  
he replied   i shall seek refuge on a mountain  which will save me from the water   noah cried   today there is no refuge for anyone from god s command except for those to whom he shows mercy   thereupon  a wave swept in between them  and noah s son was among those who were drowned 
a voice cried out   earth  swallow up your waters o sky  cease your rain   the waters receded the command was fulfilled the ark came to rest on mount judi it was said   away with the wrong doing people  
noah called out to his lord  saying   my lord  my son was a part of my family your promise was surely true you are the most just of all judges  
god said   noah  he was not one of your family for  indeed  he was unrighteous in his conduct do not question me about something of which you have no knowledge  i admonish you lest you become like an ignorant man  
he said   my lord  i take refuge with you from asking you something of which i have no knowledge if you do not forgive me and show me mercy  i shall be one of the losers  
god said   noah  go ashore in peace  our blessings upon you and upon the people who are with you and upon some of the descendants of those who are with you as for the unrighteous we shall grant provision for a time  then a grievous punishment from us shall afflict them  
these are tidings of the unseen that we reveal to you  o prophet   which you did not know before  nor did your people  so be patient  the future belongs to the god fearing 
to ad we sent their brother hud he said   o my people  worship god alone  you have no god but him you do nothing but fabricate lies 
i ask of you nothing in return for this message my recompense is with him who has created me why do you not use your reason 
my people  seek forgiveness of your lord and turn to him in repentance he will send from the sky abundant rain upon you  he will add strength to your strength do not turn away from him as evil doers  
they replied   hud  you have not brought us any clear evidence and we shall not forsake our deities merely at your behest  nor will we believe in you 
we can only say that some of our gods have stricken you with evil   he said   i call god to witness  and you also bear witness  that i disown those which you associate with god 
so scheme against me  all of you together  and then grant me no respite 
i have put my trust in god  my lord and your lord for there is no living creature which he does not hold by its forelock my lord is on the straight path 
if you turn away  i have conveyed to you the message with which i was sent my lord will make another people your successors and you cannot harm him in the least for my lord is guardian over all things 
when our command came  we delivered hud and those who believed with him by our special mercy we saved them from a severe punishment 
such were the ad who denied the signs of their lord and disobeyed his messengers and followed the bidding of every headstrong enemy of truth 
they were pursued by a curse in this world as they will be on the day of resurrection indeed  the ad denied their lord so away with the ad  the people of hud 
to the thamud we sent their brother salih he said   my people  worship god  you have no god but him it was he who brought you into being from the earth and settled you upon it and so ask his forgiveness turn to him in repentance my lord is near and responsive  
they said   o salih  we had great hopes in you do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped we are in grave doubt  amounting to suspicion  concerning that to which you call us  
he said   o my people  tell me  if i have clear evidence from my lord  and he has granted his mercy  who then will support me against god  if i disobey him you would only make my loss greater 
my people  this she camel of god is a sign for you so leave her alone to graze on god s earth and do her no harm  lest you should be instantly afflicted with a torment  
but they hamstrung her he salih said   enjoy yourselves in your homes for three more days this warning will not prove false  
then when our command came by our grace  we saved salih and those who believed along with him from the disgrace of that day surely  your lord is powerful and mighty 
the wrongdoers were overtaken by a dreadful blast and they lay dead in their homes 
as if they had never dwelt there the thamud denied their lord  cursed are the tribe of thamud 
our messengers came to abraham with good news and greeted him with   peace   he too said   peace be on you   and hastened to bring a roasted calf 
but when he saw that they made no move to eat  he found this strange and became afraid of them they said   do not be afraid  for we have been sent to the people of lot  
his wife  who was standing nearby  laughed when we gave her the good news of isaac  and after isaac  jacob 
she said   alas  shall i bear a child in this old age  while my husband here is also old this is indeed a strange thing  
they said   are you astonished at god s command may the mercy of god and his blessings be upon you  o people of this house surely  he is praiseworthy and glorious  
when the fear had left abraham  and the glad tidings had been conveyed to him  he began to plead with us for lot s people 
for abraham was forbearing  tender hearted and oft returning to god 
we said   abraham  cease your pleading  the command of your lord has gone forth there shall fall upon them a punishment which none can avert  
when our messengers came to lot  he was uneasy on this account and felt powerless to protect them he said   this is a dreadful day  
his people  who were used to committing foul deeds  came running to him he said   my people  here are my daughters they are purer for you  if you marry so have some fear of god and do not disgrace me before my guests is there not a single right minded man among you  
they replied   you know we have no need of your daughters you know very well what we are seeking  
he said   if only i had the strength to stop you or could take refuge in some powerful support  
they said   lot  we are your lord s messengers by no means shall they reach you  so depart with your family while it is yet night and let none of you look back but your wife will suffer the fate that befalls the others their appointed time is the morning  is the morning not near  
when our command came  we turned that town upside down and we rained upon it stones of clay  layer upon layer 
marked for them by the decree of your lord the punishment of the unjust was not far off 
to the people of midian  we sent their brother shu ayb he said   my people  worship god you have no deity other than him do not give short measure and short weight i see you are prospering i fear for you the punishment of a fateful day 
o my people  always give full measure and weight  in all fairness and do not defraud people by making short delivery  and do not spread corruption in the land 
what god leaves with you is the best for you  if you are believers i have not been appointed as your keeper  
they said   shu ayb  does your prayer tell you that we should abandon what our forefathers worshipped and that we should stop disposing of our belongings as we please you are indeed the only wise and rightly guided man  
 shu ayb said   o my people  what do you think if i have clear evidence from my lord  and he has sustained me with fair sustenance from himself should i not guide you i have no desire to do  out of opposition to you  what i am asking you not to do i only want to reform you as far as i can nor can i succeed without god s help in him i have put my trust and to him i turn 
o my people  do not let your opposition to me bring upon you a fate similar to the peoples of noah or hud or salih  nor is it long since the people of lot were punished 
seek forgiveness of your lord and turn to him in repentance for my lord is indeed merciful and loving  
they replied   shu ayb  we do not understand much of what you say in fact  we see that you are powerless among us were it not for your clan  we would have stoned you  for you are not strong against us  
he said   my people  is my tribe mightier to you than god you put him behind you  turning your backs on him  surely  my lord encompasses all that you do 
my people  do what you will and so shall i you will certainly come to know who will receive a punishment to disgrace him  and who is a liar wait on  i shall wait on with you  
when our command came  we saved shu ayb and those who believed with him as a mercy from ourself  while the blast overtook the wrongdoers  so that they lay dead in their homes 
as though they had never dwelt therein oh  away with the people of midian  just as happened with the thamud 
we sent forth moses with our signs and with manifest authority 
to pharaoh and his nobles but they followed the command of pharaoh and the command of pharaoh was not rightly directed 
he shall stand at the head of his people on the day of resurrection  and shall lead them into the fire evil is the place to which they shall be led 
a curse followed them in this world  and shall follow them on the day of resurrection what a foul gift to be given 
we relate to you such accounts of earlier towns  some of them are still standing  while others have ceased to exist 
we did not wrong them  they wronged themselves  the deities they called on besides god availed them nothing  when god s command came upon them  they only added to their ruin 
such is the punishment of your lord when he seizes the towns in the midst of their sins  his punishing grip is terrible and severe 
in that is a sign for him who fears the punishment of the hereafter that is a day for which mankind shall be gathered together  a day when all will be present 
we will only postpone it until a predetermined time 
and when that day arrives  no soul shall speak but by his leave among those some shall be damned  and others shall be blessed 
the wretched ones will be in the fire sighing and groaning 
remaining in it timelessly  for ever  as long as the heavens and earth endure  except as your lord wills your lord carries out whatever he wills 
those who are blessed shall abide in the garden  they will dwell therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure  except as your lord wills such bounty shall be unending 
have no doubt as to what they worship they worship nothing but what their fathers worshipped before them we shall certainly give them their share in full  without diminishing anything 
we certainly gave the book to moses  but differences arose about it  had it not been that a word had gone forth before from your lord  judgement would indeed have been passed on them then and there  yet they are in grave doubt about it 
your lord will reward each one of them in full for their deeds he is well aware of all their actions 
therefore stand firm in the straight path as you are commanded  along with those who have turned to god with you  and do not exceed the bounds  for he sees everything you do 
do not incline toward those who do wrong  lest the fire touch you for then you would have none to protect you from god  and you will not be helped 
say your prayers morning and evening  and during parts of the night  surely good makes amends for evil this is a reminder for people who pay heed 
be steadfast  for surely  god does not let the wages of the righteous be wasted 
why  then  were there not among the generations before you upright men who would speak out against the spread of corruption on earth    except for the few whom we saved but the wrongdoers pursued their worldly pleasures and thus became guilty 
your lord would never unjustly destroy communities while their people were trying to reform 
if your lord had wished  he would have made mankind into one community as it is  they will not cease to dispute    
and to this end he has created them all   except for those to whom your lord has shown mercy the word of your lord shall be fulfilled   i will fill hell with jinn and men all together  
we have told you the stories of the prophets to make your heart firm and in these accounts truth has come to you  with an exhortation and a reminder for the believers 
say to those who do not believe  you do things in your way and we are doing things in our way 
and wait  we too are waiting  
the knowledge of the secret of the heavens and the earth belongs to god alone  and to him shall all affairs be referred so worship him and put your trust in him alone your lord is not unaware of what you do 
alif lam ra these are verses from the clear book 
we have sent down the quran in arabic  so that you may understand 
we recount to you the best of narratives in revealing this quran to you  even though you were unaware of it before it came 
when joseph told his father   my father  i saw eleven stars  and the sun and moon  i saw them prostrate themselves before me  
he replied   my son  do not relate your dream to your brothers  lest they plot evil against you    satan is the sworn enemy of man 
you shall be chosen by your lord and he will impart to you some understanding of the inner meaning of events he will bestow the full measure of his blessings upon you and upon the house of jacob    even as he formerly bestowed it in full measure upon your forefathers  abraham and isaac truly  your sustainer is all knowing and wise  
surely  in joseph and his brothers there are signs for the inquirers 
they said to each other    surely joseph and his brother benjamin are dearer to our father than ourselves  although we are a band truly  our father is clearly mistaken 
therefore  let us put joseph to death or cast him away to some far off land  so that our father s attention should turn only to us  and you can thereafter become a righteous people  
one of them said   do not kill joseph  but if you must do something  cast him into the bottom of a well  some of the travellers will pick him up  
they said to their father   why do you not trust us with joseph we are indeed his well wishers 
send him with us tomorrow  so that he may play and enjoy himself we will look after him  
 jacob said   it would indeed grieve me if you took him away with you  and i fear lest the wolf should devour him while you are off your guard  
they said   surely  if the wolf devoured him while we were a strong party  we should indeed be great losers  
and so  when they went away with him  they decided to cast him into the dark depths of a well then we revealed to him our will   you shall one day tell them of this deed of theirs  when they do not realize who you are  
and at nightfall they came to their father  weeping 
they said   father  we went off racing and left joseph with our belongings  and the wolf devoured him but you will not believe us  even though we are telling the truth  
and they showed him their brother s shirt  stained with false blood  no   he cried  your souls have tempted you to do something evil  but it is best to be patient  god alone can help me bear the loss you speak of  
and there came a caravan of travellers and they sent their water drawer to draw water from the well he let down his bucket into the well and he exclaimed   oh  what a lucky find  here is a boy   they hid him like a piece of merchandise  but god knew well what they did 
later they sold him for a paltry sum  a few pieces of silver dirhams   so little did they value him 
the egyptian who bought him said to his wife   lodge him honourably  he may prove of benefit to us  or we may even adopt him as our son   thus we established joseph in the land  so that we might teach him the true meaning of events god has power over all things however  most people do not know this 
and when he reached maturity  we bestowed on him right judgement and knowledge thus we reward those who do good 
however  the woman in whose house he lived  wanted to seduce him one day she bolted the doors and said   come   he replied   god forbid  truly your husband is my master and has treated me honourably wrongdoers certainly never prosper  
she started towards him  and he would have succumbed to her  if he had not seen a sign from his lord    we did this in order to keep evil and indecency away from him  for he was truly one of our chosen servants 
they both ran to the door and  in the struggle  she tore his shirt at the back they found her husband at the door she cried   shall not the man who wished to violate your wife be thrown into prison or sternly punished  
joseph said   it was she who sought to seduce me   one of her household testified   if his shirt is torn at the front then she is speaking the truth  and he is lying 
but if it is torn from behind then she is lying  and he speaks the truth  
so when he saw his shirt torn from behind her husband said   this is the guile of you women your guile is great indeed 
joseph  overlook this  but you wife   ask forgiveness for your sin  for you have done wrong  
women in the town began to gossip   the nobleman s wife is trying to seduce her slave  love for him consumes her heart  indeed  we see her in manifest error  
when she heard of their intrigues  she sent for them and prepared a party for them she gave a knife to each of them to cut fruits  etc and then asked joseph to appear before them when the women saw him  they were greatly amazed at his beauty   and they cut their hands  exclaiming   god preserve us  this is no human being but a noble angel  
she said   this is he about whom you have been blaming me  and  indeed  i did try to make him yield to me  but he was unyielding now  however  if he does not do as i bid him  he shall certainly be put in prison and be humiliated  
joseph said   o my lord  i would prefer prison to what these women are inviting me to do and if you do not avert their guile from me  i may yield to them and so become one of the ignorant  
so his lord answered him and warded off their guile he is all hearing and all knowing 
yet  even after all the evidence they had seen  they thought it right to jail him for a time 
two young men entered the prison along with him one of them said   i saw myself in a dream i was pressing wine   the other said   i dreamed i was carrying bread on my head from which the birds were eating tell us their meaning  for we see that you are one who does good to all  
joseph said to them   i shall inform you of the interpretation of your dreams before your meal is brought to you this is a part of the knowledge that my lord has taught me i have renounced the religion of the people who do not believe in god and who deny the hereafter 
i follow the religion of my fathers  abraham  isaac and jacob  and it is not for us to associate anyone with god as a partner this is of god s grace upon us and upon mankind  even though most men are not grateful 
o my two fellow prisoners  are many diverse lords better  or god  the one  the almighty 
all those you worship instead of him are mere names you and your forefathers have invented  names for which god has sent down no authority  all power belongs to god alone  and he orders you to worship none but him  this is the true faith  though most people do not realize it 
o my two fellow prisoners  one of you will serve wine to his lord  the other of you will be crucified and birds will feed off his head the matter about which you have been seeking my opinion has been so decreed  
he said to the one he thought would be saved   mention me to your master   however satan made him forget to mention him to his master  and so joseph remained in prison for a number of years 
the king said   i saw in a dream seven fat cows which seven lean ones were eating  also seven green ears of corn and seven others which were dry tell me the meaning of this vision  my nobles  if you can interpret visions  
they said   these are confusing dreams and we do not know the interpretation of such dreams  
then one of the two men who had been released and who  after a long time  remembered  said   i shall tell you its interpretation  therefore  give me leave to go to joseph in prison  
o truthful joseph  he said   tell us the meaning of a dream in which seven fat cows are being eaten by seven lean ones  and there are seven green ears of corn and seven others which are dry  so that i may return to my people and inform them  
joseph said   you shall sow for seven consecutive years as usual  but leave in the ear the harvest that you reap  except for a little which you may eat 
then there will follow seven years of great hardship which will consume all but a little of what you stored 
then a year will come after that when people will have abundant rain and when once more they will press wine and oil  
the king said   bring him to me   when the king s messenger came to joseph  he said   go back to your master and ask him about the women who cut their hands  my lord knows well their guile  
the king asked the women   what was the truth of the affair in which you tried to seduce joseph   the women said   god forbid  we know no evil of him   the wife of the nobleman said   the truth has now come to light it was i who tried to seduce him  he is surely an honest man  
from this  said joseph    the nobleman should know that i did not betray him in his absence  and that god does not guide the plotting of the treacherous 
i am not trying to absolve myself  for man s very soul incites him to evil unless my lord bestows his mercy indeed  my lord is forgiving and merciful  
the king said   bring him to me i will take him for my special service   and when he had spoken to him  he said   from now on you will dwell with us  honoured and trusted  
joseph said   place in my charge the storehouses of the land  for i am a good and knowledgeable custodian  
thus we caused joseph to be established in a position of authority in the land he could dwell therein wherever he pleased we bestow our mercy on whomever we please  and we do not allow the reward of the righteous to go to waste 
yet the reward of the hereafter is best for those who believe and are mindful of god 
joseph s brothers arrived and presented themselves before him he recognized them  but they did not know him 
when he had made provision for them  he told them   bring me your brother on your father s side do you not see that i give you full measure and that i am the best of hosts 
but if you do not bring him to me  you shall have no grain from me  nor shall you ever approach me again  
they replied   we shall try to persuade his father to send him with us we shall do our utmost   
joseph said to his servants   put their money back into their saddlebags  so that they will recognize it when they return home to their family  thus they may come back  
when they returned to their father  they said   our father  any further measure of grain has been denied us  so send our brother benjamin along with us  so that we may obtain our measure of grain   and  we shall guard him well  
he replied   am i to trust you with him as i once trusted you with his brother but god is the best of guardians  the most merciful of all  
when they opened their packs  they discovered that their money had been returned to them they said   our father  what more do we desire than this this money of ours has been returned to us  so we shall again buy food for our family and we shall guard our brother  and we shall obtain an additional camel load of grain this that we bring now is a small quantity  
he jacob said   i will never send him with you until you give me a solemn pledge  before god  that you will indeed bring him back to me  unless you yourselves are trapped in a compulsive situation   and when they had given him their solemn pledge  jacob said   god shall be witness to all that we say  
o my sons  do not all of you enter the city by one gate  enter by separate gates i cannot help you in any way against god  judgement is his alone in him i have put my trust in him let the faithful put their trust 
they entered safely as their father had told them however  he had no power to guard them against god s decree it was only a wish in jacob s soul which he had thus fulfilled he was possessed of knowledge which we had given him but most people have no knowledge 
when they presented themselves before joseph  he took his brother benjamin aside he said   i am your brother  so do not feel distressed about whatever they have been doing  
and when he had given them their provisions  he placed a drinking cup in his brother s pack then a crier called out after them   men of the caravan  you have committed theft  
they said  turning towards him   what is it that you have lost  
we miss the royal measuring bowl  he replied  he who brings it shall have a camel load of corn i pledge my word for it  
they said   by god  you ought to know we have not come here to cause any trouble in the land we are not thieves  
the egyptians asked them   and if we find that you are lying  what penalty shall we mete out to you  
they replied   the penalty should be that he in whose saddlebag it is found  should be held as bondman to atone for the crime that is how we punish the wrongdoers  
he the herald searched their bags before his brother s and then took out the cup from his brother s bag in this way  we devised a plan on behalf of joseph he could not have detained his brother under the king s law  unless god so willed we exalt whoever we please  but above those who have knowledge there is one all knowing 
they said   if he is a thief  a brother of his had also committed theft before him   but joseph kept his secret and revealed nothing to them he said to himself    your deed was worse god best knows the things you speak of  
they said   o exalted one  he has a very aged father  take one of us in his place we can see that you are a very good man  
he replied   god forbid that we should take anyone other than the person on whom we found our property in that case  we would clearly be wrongdoers  
when they had lost all hope of persuading him  they withdrew  conferring among themselves the eldest said   do you not know that your father took from you a pledge in god s name you have already failed with regard to joseph  so i shall never leave the land until my father permits me to  or god decides things for me he is the best judge 
return to your father and say  father  your son has committed a theft we testify only to what we know how could we guard against the unforeseen 
inquire of the people of the city where we lodged  and of the caravan with which we travelled we are telling you the truth  
jacob said   no  but you have yourselves contrived a story but it is best to be patient god may well bring them all back to me in the end for he is indeed full of knowledge and wisdom  
and he turned away from them  crying   alas for joseph   his eyes went white with grief  and he was filled with sorrow 
they said   by god  will you keep on remembering joseph until your health is ruined  and you die  
he said  i only complain of my anguish and my sorrow to god god has made known to me things that you do not know 
go  my sons  and seek news of joseph and his brother do not despair of god s mercy  none but those who deny the truth despair of god s mercy  
when his brothers presented themselves before joseph  they pleaded   exalted one  distress has afflicted us and our family and we have brought only a paltry sum  but give us full measure be charitable to us truly  god rewards the charitable  
he said   are you aware of what you did to joseph and his brother in ignorance  
they exclaimed   are you indeed joseph   he replied   i am joseph and this is my brother god has indeed been gracious to us the truth is that god does not waste the reward of those who do good  who are righteous and steadfast  
 the brothers said   by god  most certainly god has raised you high above us  and we have indeed been guilty  
he said   no blame shall fall on you this day  may god forgive you  and he is the most merciful of those who show mercy 
go with this shirt of mine and cast it upon my father s face he will recover his sight  thereupon come back to me with all your family  
when the caravan set out from egypt  their father in canaan said   you may think i am senile  but i certainly perceive the breath of joseph  
they said   by god  you still persist in your illusions  
but when the bearer of the good news arrived and cast the shirt on jacob s face  his eyesight returned and he said   did i not tell you that i know from god what you do not know  
they said   o our father  ask forgiveness for our sins    we were truly in the wrong  
he said   i shall certainly ask my lord to forgive you surely  he is the most forgiving and merciful  
then  when they presented themselves before joseph  he drew his parents to him and said   welcome to egypt  in safety  if god wills  
he helped his parents to a couch and they all fell down on their knees before him he said   my father  this is the interpretation of my dream my lord has made it come true  he was kind to me when he let me out of prison and brought you from the desert after satan had brought about discord between me and my brethren my lord is the best planner in achieving what he will  he is all knowing  and truly wise  
then joseph prayed   my lord  you have given me power and taught me the interpretation of dreams creator of the heavens and the earth  you are my patron in this world and the hereafter  make me die in submission to you and admit me among the righteous  
these are tidings of the unseen that we reveal to you  o prophet   though you were not present with them when they plotted and agreed upon a plan 
yet most men will not become believers  no matter how eager you may be 
you shall not ask them for any reward for this it is but a reminder for all mankind 
and there are many signs in the heavens and the earth that they pass by and give no heed to   
and most of them  even when they profess belief in god  attribute partners to him 
do they feel secure that the all encompassing punishment of god will not come upon them  or that the last hour will not come upon them suddenly when they least expect it 
say   this is my way  on the basis of sure knowledge  i call on you to have faith in god  i and those who follow me god is holy  i am not one of those who associate partners with god  
all the messengers we sent before you muhammad were human beings to whom we made revelations  they were men chosen from the people of their towns did they not travel across the earth and see the end of those before them those who are mindful of god prefer the life to come will you not then understand 
when the messengers lost all hopes and thought that they had been told lies  our help came to them  we saved whoever we pleased  but our punishment will not be averted from the guilty 
in their stories there is a lesson for men of understanding this quran is no invented tale  but a confirmation of the previous scripture and a detailed explanation of all things as well as guidance and mercy to true believers 
alif lam mim ra these are the verses of the book what is sent down to you from your lord is the truth  yet most men do not believe in it 
it was god who raised the heavens with no visible supports  and then established himself on the throne  he has regulated the sun and the moon  so that each will pursue its course for an appointed time  he ordains all things and makes plain his revelations  so that you may be certain of meeting your lord 
it was he who spread out the earth and placed upon it mountains and rivers  and fruits of every kind in male and female pairs he drew the veil of night over the day in all this  truly  there are signs for people who reflect 
on the earth are diverse tracts  adjoining one another  vineyards and cornfields and groves of palm  the single and the clustered their fruits are nourished by the same water  yet we make the taste of some excel that of others in this also are signs for people who understand 
if anything can astonish you  you should surely be astonished at their asking   what when we become dust  shall we be created anew   these are the ones who deny their lord  around their necks there shall be fetters they are the inheritors of the fire  and shall abide therein forever 
they demand that you hasten on the evil rather than the good  although there have been many examples of punishment before them    your lord is full of forgiveness for mankind  despite their wrongdoings  but he is truly severe in punishment 
those who deny the truth ask   why has no sign been sent down to him by his lord   but you are only a warner  every people has its guide 
god knows what every female bears he knows of every change within the womb for everything he has a proper measure 
he is the knower of the unseen and the visible  the great  the most exalted 
it makes no difference whether you converse in secret or aloud  whether you hide under the cloak of night or walk about freely in the light of day 
each has guardian angels before him and behind him  who watch him at god s command god does not change the condition of a people s lot  unless they change what is in their hearts but when god decrees punishment for a people  none can ward it off besides him  they have no protector 
it is he who shows you the lightning  inspiring fear and hope  and gathers up the heavy clouds 
and the thunder glorifies him with his praise and the angels do so too in awe of him  and he sends his thunderbolts to strike anyone he pleases  yet they dispute about god  who is inexorable in his power 
the only true appeal is to god alone  those they appeal to instead of him will never respond to them in any way they are like a man who stretches forth his hands toward the water  so that it may reach his mouth  but it never does the calls of those who deny the truth are all in vain 
all who dwell in heavens and on the earth submit to god alone  willingly or unwillingly  as do their shadows in the mornings and in the evenings 
say   who is lord of the heavens and the earth   say   god   say   why do you take protectors other than him  who can neither benefit nor harm even themselves   say   are the blind and the seeing equal is darkness equal to the light or have they assigned partners to god who create as he creates  so that both creations appear to them alike   say   god is the creator of all things he is the one  the almighty  
he sends down water from the sky that fills riverbeds to overflowing  each according to its measure the torrent carries along swelling foam  akin to what rises from smelted ore from which man makes ornaments and tools god thus depicts truth and falsehood the scum is cast away  but whatever is of use to man remains behind god thus speaks in parables 
there will be the best of rewards for those who respond to their lord  while those who do not respond to him    if they possessed all that is on earth and twice as much  they would surely offer it as ransom on the day of judgement      will have the worst reckoning and their goal is hell  and how evil a resting place 
can one who knows that whatever has been sent down to you from your lord is the truth  be equal to one who is blind it is only those who are endowed with insight who pay heed 
they who are true to their bond with god and never break their covenant 
and those who join together what god has commanded to be joined  and fear their lord and dread the harshness of the reckoning 
those who are steadfast in seeking the favour of their lord  and pray regularly and spend secretly and openly out of what we have provided them with  and ward off evil with good theirs shall be the final abode 
they shall enter the eternal gardens of eden  along with the righteous from among their fathers  wives and descendants from every gate the angels will come to them  saying 
peace be upon you for all that you have steadfastly endured how excellent is the final abode 
as for those who break the covenant of god  after having confirmed it  who cut asunder what god has commanded to be joined and spread corruption in the land  a curse shall be laid on them  they shall have an evil abode 
god gives abundantly to whom he will and sparingly to whom he pleases    those who deny the truth rejoice in the life of this world  yet the life of this world is but a fleeting pleasure compared with the life to come 
those who deny the truth ask   why has no sign been sent down to him by his lord   say   god lets go astray those whom he wills and guides to himself those who turn to him 
those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of god    surely in the remembrance of god hearts can find comfort 
as for those who believe and do righteous deeds    blissful is their end 
thus we have sent you to a people  before whom other peoples have passed away  so that you may recite to them what we have revealed to you yet they deny the gracious god say   he is my lord  there is no god but he in him i put my trust and to him i shall return  
even if there were a quran by which mountains could be set in motion  by which the earth could be rent asunder  or by which the dead could be made to speak they would not believe in it surely all things are subject to god s will are the faithful unaware that  had he pleased  god could have guided all mankind calamity shall not cease to strike those who deny the truth because of their misdeeds or to strike near their homes  until god s promise be fulfilled god will not fail to keep his promise 
other messengers were also mocked before you  but though i granted respite to those who denied the truth  at last i seized them  and how awful was my punishment 
is then he who watches over every soul and its actions like any other yet they ascribe partners to god say   name them  or do you presume to inform him of something on the earth of which he does not know or  is all this only your verbal assertion   indeed  their devices seem fair to those who deny the truth  and they are kept back from the right path there can be no guide for those whom god lets go astray 
punishment awaits them in the present life  but harsher is the punishment of the hereafter    no one will defend them against god 
such is the paradise which the righteous have been promised  it is watered by running streams  eternal is its fruit  and eternal is its shade that is the recompense of those who are righteous  but the recompense of those who deny the truth is the fire 
those to whom we sent the scriptures rejoice in what has been revealed to you  while some factions deny parts of it say to them   i have been commanded only to worship god and not to associate partners with him  to him i pray and to him i shall return  
thus we have revealed it as a clear commandment in arabic if you followed their desires after all the knowledge which has come to you  you would have no protector or shield against god 
we sent down messengers before you and gave them wives and children yet it was not possible for a messenger to bring a sign  save by the command of god every age has had its revelation 
god abrogates or confirms what he pleases  with him is the source of all commandments 
whether we show you part of what we have promised them or cause you to pass away before that   your mission is only to give warning  it is for us to do the reckoning 
do they not see how we come to their land and shrink its borders god decides  no one can reverse his decision  and he is swift in reckoning 
those before them did also devise plots  but in all things the master planning is god s he knows what each soul does those who deny the truth shall soon know for whom is the final abode 
those who deny the truth say   you are not god s messenger   say   sufficient is god as my witness between me and you  and those who have knowledge of the book  
alif lam ra we have revealed to you this book so that  by their lord s command  you may lead men from darkness to the light  to the path of the mighty  the praiseworthy one 
to god  who possesses whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth woe to those who deny the truth  for they shall be sternly punished 
woe to those who love this life more than the hereafter  who turn others away from the path of god and seek to make it crooked they have gone far astray 
each messenger we have sent has spoken in the language of his own people  so that he might make the message clear to them but god lets go astray whom he will and guides whom he pleases he is the almighty  the all wise 
we sent moses with our signs  saying   lead your people out of the darkness into the light  and remind them of god s days in that there are signs for every patient  grateful person  
moses said to his people   remember god s goodness to you when he delivered you from pharaoh s people who were treating you cruelly  putting your sons to death and sparing only your daughters surely that was a great trial from your lord 
remember also the time when your lord declared  if you are grateful  i will surely bestow more favours on you  but if you are ungrateful  then know that my punishment is severe indeed  
moses said   even if you should deny the truth  and all who dwell on earth together  god is self sufficient  praiseworthy  
has not news come to you concerning those who preceded you  such as noah s people  and the ad and thamud  as well as those who came after them only god knows who they were the messengers came to them with clear signs  but they put their hands to their mouths saying   we deny the message you have been sent with we have grave doubts about what you are inviting us to do  
their messengers said   is there any doubt about god  the originator of the heavens and earth he calls you to him in order to forgive you some of your offences and to reprieve you for a specific period   they said   you are only human beings like ourselves  you want to divert us from what our forefathers have been worshipping  so bring us some clear authority  
their messengers replied   we are indeed mortals like yourselves but god bestows his grace on such of his servants as he chooses we cannot give you miracles  except by god s leave in god let true believers put their trust   
and why should we not put our trust in god when he has already guided us to our paths we will  surely  bear with patience all the harm you do us so in god let those who trust put their trust  
those who deny the truth said to their messengers   we shall banish you from our land unless you return to our ways   but their lord inspired the messengers  saying   we shall destroy the evil doers 
and settle you on the land to succeed them that is in store for anyone who is in awe of meeting me  and who heeds my warnings  
when they sought our judgement  every stubborn oppressor was frustrated 
beyond him is hell  and he shall drink putrid water 
he will sip and will not find it easy to swallow it death will approach him from every quarter  yet he will not die more intense suffering will lie ahead of him 
the works of those who deny their lord are like ashes which the wind scatters on a stormy day  they shall gain nothing from what they do to act thus is to stray far into error 
do you not see that god has created the heavens and the earth for a purpose he can eliminate you if he wills and bring into being a new creation 
that is no difficult thing for god 
they shall all appear before god and the weak will say to those who behaved proudly   we were your followers can you protect us from god s punishment   they will reply   had god given us guidance  we would have guided you it is all the same whether we are patient or impatient  there is no escape for us  
when the judgement has been passed  satan will say to them   god made you a true promise  i too made you promises  but i failed you i had no authority over you  except that i called you and you responded to me do not now blame me  but blame yourselves  i cannot help you  nor can you help me i reject your former act in associating me with god   the wrongdoers will have a painful punishment 
but those who believed and did good deeds will be brought into gardens with rivers flowing through them they shall abide there forever by their lord s permission  and will be welcomed with the greeting   peace  
do you not see how god compares a good word to a good tree its root is firm and its branches are in the sky 
it yields its fruit each season with its lord s permission  god makes such comparisons for people  in order that they may take heed 
but an evil word is like an evil tree torn out of the earth  it has no foothold 
god will strengthen the believers with his steadfast word  both in the present life and in the hereafter god lets the wrongdoers go astray he does what he wills 
do you not see those who  in exchange for god s favour  offer only ingratitude and cause their people to descend into the abode of ruin 
in hell shall they burn  an evil place to stay 
they have set up rivals to god to lead people away from his path say   enjoy yourselves awhile  you will then proceed to the fire  
tell my servants  those who are true believers  to keep up prayer and to give alms secretly and openly out of what we have given them  before the day comes when there will be neither trading nor befriending 
it was god who created the heavens and the earth he sends down water from the sky with which he brings forth fruits for your sustenance  he has made ships subservient to you  so that they may sail across the sea by his command  and has subjected the rivers to you 
he has also subjected to you the sun and the moon  both steadfastly pursuing their courses he has subjected to you the night as well as the day 
he has given you all that you asked of him  and if you try to reckon up god s favours  you will not be able to count them truly man is very unjust  very ungrateful 
 remember when abraham said   my lord  make this a city of peace and help me and my children to keep away from worshipping idols 
my lord  they have led so many men astray  anyone who follows me is with me  but if anyone turns against me  you are surely forgiving and merciful 
o lord  i have settled some of my offspring in an uncultivable valley near your sacred house  lord  so that they might establish their prayers so  make people s hearts incline towards them and provide them with fruits so that they may be grateful 
lord  you have knowledge of all that we hide and all that we reveal  nothing in heaven or on earth is hidden from god 
praise be to god who has bestowed upon me  despite my old age  ishmael and isaac surely my lord is the hearer of prayer 
lord  grant that i may keep up the prayer  and so may my offspring my lord  accept my prayer 
forgive me  lord  and forgive my parents and all the believers on the day of reckoning  
do not think god is unaware of the wrongdoers actions he only gives them respite till the day on which all eyes will stare fixedly in horror 
they will hurry on in fright  their heads lifted up  their gaze directed forward  their minds utterly void 
warn men of the day when the punishment will come upon them  and when the wrongdoers will say   our lord  grant us respite for a short while we will respond to your call and will follow the messengers   but god will answer   are you not those who swore that you would never suffer any decline 
you lived in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves  and it was made clear to you how we had dealt with them and we gave you many examples 
they hatched their plots  but these plots were all within god s knowledge though their plots were such as to shake the mountains  god will bring their plots to nothing 
never think that god will fail in his promise to his messengers god is mighty and capable of retribution 
on the day when the earth shall be changed into another earth  as shall be the heavens  they will all appear before god  the one  the most supreme 
on that day you shall see the guilty bound in chains 
their garments shall be of pitch and the fire shall envelop their faces 
god will requite each soul according to its deeds swift is god s reckoning 
this is a message for mankind let them take warning from it and know that he is but one god let those possessed of understanding may take heed 
alif lam ra these are the verses of a clear book  the quran 
a time will surely come when those who are bent on denying the truth will wish that they had surrendered themselves to god 
so leave them to eat and enjoy themselves and let them be beguiled by vain hopes  for soon they will realise the truth 
we have never destroyed a township without a definite decree having been issued 
no people can forestall their doom  nor can they delay it 
they say   you to whom the reminder the quran has been sent down  you are surely possessed 
why do you not bring down the angels upon us  if you are truthful  
but we send down the angels only to bring justice and then they will not be reprieved 
it is we who have sent down the reminder and we will  most surely  safeguard it 
we sent messengers before you to the previous peoples 
but there was never a messenger who came to them but they mocked him 
thus we cause this habit of mocking to enter into the hearts of the sinful 
they will not believe in it  though they have before them the example of former peoples 
and even if we opened to them a door from heaven  and they began ascending through it 
they would still say   our eyes have been dazzled we are bewitched  
we have placed constellations in heaven and have beautified it for beholders 
and we have guarded it from every accursed devil 
but if anyone eavesdrops  he is pursued by a bright flaming fire 
we have spread out the earth  and set upon it firm mountains and caused everything to grow in due proportion 
we have provided therein a means of livelihood for you and for all those creatures for whom you do not provide 
there is not a thing but its storehouses are with us but we only send down each thing in an appropriate measure 
we let loose fertilizing winds  and bring water from the sky for you to drink  and you could not have stored it up for yourselves 
truly  it is we who bring to life and we who cause death and we are the inheritor of all things 
we know those who lived before you and those who will come after you 
it is your lord who will gather them he is all wise and all knowing 
we created man out of dry clay  from moulded mud 
and the jinn we had created before from flaming fire 
your lord said to the angels   i am about to bring into being a man wrought from mud 
when i have formed him and breathed my spirit into him  fall down in prostration before him  
then the angels all prostrated themselves together 
but satan did not  he refused to join those who prostrated themselves 
god asked him   what is the matter with you  that you are not among those who have prostrated themselves  
he replied   i am not one to prostrate myself to a man whom you have created out of a clay of moulded mud  
god said   then get out of here  for you are accursed 
and the curse shall be on you till the day of judgement  
satan said   o my lord  grant me respite till the day of resurrection  
he said   you are granted respite
till that appointed day  
he said   my lord  since you have let me go astray i shall make the path of error seem alluring to them on the earth and shall mislead them all 
except for your chosen servants  
god said   this is the path which leads straight to me 
surely  you shall have no power over my true servants  except those misguided ones who choose to follow you 
surely  hell is the place to which they are destined 
it has seven gates  and each gate has a portion of them allotted to it 
truly  the god fearing shall dwell amid gardens and fountains   
enter therein in peace and security    
we shall cleanse their hearts of all traces of ill will  they will be like brethren seated on couches facing one another 
they will not be affected by any weariness there  and they will never be made to leave  
tell my servants that i alone am the forgiving  the merciful one 
and that my punishment is a painful punishment 
tell them about abraham s guests 
when they came to him they greeted him with   peace   he said  we feel afraid of you  
they said   do not be afraid we come to you with good news you shall have a son who shall be endowed with great knowledge  
he said   do you bring me such news despite my old age what kind of good news are you bringing me  
they said   we have  indeed  given you glad tidings in truth  do not therefore despair  
he said   who but the misguided despair of the mercy of their lord  
then he asked   what then is your business  o messengers  
they said   we have been sent forth to a guilty people  
except for lot s household  all of whom we shall rescue 
except his wife we have decreed that she will be among those who remain behind and will be lost 
when the messengers came to lot and his family 
he said   you are strangers to me  
they said   no  but we bring you news about what they disputed 
and we have come to you with the truth  and surely we are truthful 
so leave with your family some time in the latter part of the night  and walk behind them let none of you look back go where you are commanded  
we communicated to him our decree that the guilty ones would be destroyed by the morning 
the people of the town came along  revelling 
and he told them   these are my guests  so do not disgrace me 
fear god and do not shame me  
they said   did we not forbid you to extend hospitality to strangers  
he said   here are my daughters  if you must act in this way  
by your life  they wandered on in their wild intoxication
and thereupon the blast of our punishment overtook them at sunrise 
we turned the town upside down and rained upon them stones of clay 
there are certainly signs in that for those who can learn a lesson   
it is still there on the highway   
surely in this there is a sign for those who believe 
the people of the wood were also surely wrongdoers 
so we took vengeance on them both are still there on the highway  plain for all to see 
the people of al hijr also rejected our messengers 
we gave them our signs  but they turned away from them 
they carved out dwellings in the mountains  and lived in security   
the blast overtook them early one morning 
all that they had acquired was of no avail to them 
we have created the heavens and the earth and all that is between the two in accordance with the requirements of truth and wisdom the hour is surely coming so overlook their faults with gracious forgiveness 
surely your lord is the all knowing creator 
we have given you the seven oft recited verses and the great quran 
do not strain your eyes towards the worldly benefits we have bestowed on some of them  nor grieve on their account lower your wing of mercy for the believers
and say   i am  indeed  a plain warner  
such as we send down for those who are divisive 
and who have broken the scripture into fragments   
by your lord  we shall question them all
about whatever they had been doing 
proclaim openly what you are commanded  and avoid the polytheists 
we will  surely  suffice you against those who mock 
who set up another god with god  but they shall soon learn 
we do indeed know how your heart is distressed at what they say 
but glorify your lord with his praise  and prostrate yourself 
and worship your lord until what is certain death comes to you 
the decree of god is at hand  so do not seek to hasten it holy is he  and exalted far above what they associate with him 
he sends down the angels with revelations by his command to whoever of his servants he pleases  saying   warn mankind that there is no god save me  so fear me  
he created the heavens and the earth for a true purpose he is exalted above anything they associate with him 
he created man out of a mere drop of sperm  yet he shows himself to be openly contentious 
he has created cattle for you  from them you derive food and clothing and numerous other benefits 
how pleasant they look when you bring them home in the evenings and when you take them out to pasture in the mornings 
they carry your loads to places which you could otherwise not reach without great hardship  surely  your lord is compassionate and merciful 
he has created horses  mules and donkeys  so that you may ride them  and also so that they may be put on show  and he creates other things beyond your knowledge 
the straight way leads to god and there are ways which deviate from the right course if he so wished  he would guide you all 
it is he who sends down water from the sky from it you drink and with it trees grow on which you pasture your cattle 
and with it he grows for you corn  and the olive and the date palm and the grape  and all kinds of fruits surely  in that is a sign for a people who reflect 
he has made the night and the day and the sun and the moon subservient to you  and all the stars are subservient to his command surely in this there are signs for men of understanding 
on the earth he has fashioned for you objects of various hues  there is certainly a sign in that for people who pay heed 
it is he who subjected to you the sea  so that you may eat its fresh seafood and bring forth from it ornaments to wear you see the ships cleaving through it all this  so that you may seek his bounty and feel grateful 
he has set up on the earth firm mountains  lest it shake under you  and rivers and tracks  so that you may find your way 
and he has set up other landmarks by these and by the stars people set their course 
is he  then  who creates like him who does not create will you not  then  take heed 
if you tried to count god s blessings  you would never be able to number them god is ever forgiving and most merciful 
god knows all that you conceal and all that you reveal 
those you call on besides god cannot create anything they are themselves created 
they are dead  not living  nor do they know when they will be raised to life 
your god is the one god as for those who do not believe in the hereafter  their hearts refuse to admit the truth and they are arrogant 
god surely knows what they conceal and what they reveal he does not love the arrogant 
when they are asked   what is it that your lord has sent down   they say   stories of the ancients  
let them bear all their own burdens on resurrection day as well as some of the burdens of those whom they lead astray without any knowledge how evil the load with which they shall be burdened 
those who went before them also plotted but god struck at the foundations of their building  and the roof fell down upon them from above the punishment came upon them from where they did not expect 
then on the day of resurrection he will disgrace them  and say   where are my partners for whose sake you opposed my guidance   those given knowledge will say   this day humiliation and affliction will surely befall those who have been denying the truth  
those whose lives the angels take while they are wronging their own souls will offer submission saying   we were not doing anything evil    indeed   the angels will reply   god is aware of what you have been doing 
so enter the gates of hell there you shall abide forever   evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant 
when those who fear god are asked   what has your lord sent down   their reply is   goodness   the reward of those who do good works in this world is good  but the abode of the hereafter is even better the home of the righteous is indeed excellent 
they will enter gardens of eternity  where rivers will flow at their feet there they will have all that they wish for thus god rewards the righteous 
those whose lives the angels take in a state of purity  saying to them    peace be on you  enter the garden  because of the good which you did in the world  
are they waiting for the angels to come to them  or the fulfillment of your lord s will those who went before them did the same god did not wrong them  rather they wronged themselves 
the evil results of their deeds overtook them  and that which they used to mock at encompassed them 
those who associate others with god say   if god had so willed we would not have worshipped anything besides him  neither we nor our fathers  nor would we have forbidden anything without his sanction   so did those who went before them the duty of the messengers is only to convey the message clearly 
we raised among every people a messenger who enjoined   worship god alone and shun the evil one   then among them were some whom god guided and among them were others who became deserving of ruin so travel across the earth and observe what was the end of those who rejected the messengers 
though you prophet may be eager to guide them  god does not guide those whom he lets go astray  because of their refusal to give a positive response to the truth they will have no supporters 
they swear their strongest oaths by god that god will never raise the dead to life    nonetheless  it is a promise truly binding on him  even though most people do not realize it   
this is so that he may make clear to them what they have differed about and so that those who are bent on denying the truth may realize that they were lying 
when we will something to happen  all that we say is   be   and it is 
as for those who  after persecution  migrated from their homes for the cause of god  we will provide them with a goodly abode in this life  but truly the reward of the hereafter will be greater  if they only knew it 
they are the ones who are steadfast and put their trust in their lord 
before you also the messengers we sent were but mortal men to whom we vouchsafed revelation ask the people of the book  if you do not know 
 we sent them with clear signs and scriptures we have sent down the reminder to you  to enable you to make clear to mankind what has been sent down to them  so that they may reflect upon it 
do those who devise evil plans feel secure that god will not make them sink into the land  or that a punishment will not come upon them from where they least expect 
or that he will not seize them suddenly in their daily activities and they will not be able to frustrate him 
or that he will not punish them by giving them a fright indeed  your lord is kind and merciful 
have they not observed the things god has created  casting their shadows right and left  prostrating themselves before god in all humility 
everything in the heavens and all the creatures on the earth prostrate themselves before god  as do the angels  and they do not behave proudly 
they fear their lord above them  and do what they are commanded 
god says   do not take two gods he is only one god so fear me alone  
to him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth  and obedience is due to him alone will you then fear anyone other than god 
whatever blessing you have is from god  and to him you turn for help when distress befalls you 
yet no sooner does he relieve your distress than some among you set up other partners besides their lord 
showing no gratitude for what we have given them enjoy yourselves awhile  but soon you will know 
they even appoint a share of what we have provided for them to false gods they know nothing of you shall surely be questioned about the lies you have been fabricating 
they assign daughters to god  glory be to him   but for themselves sons that they desire to have 
when the birth of a girl is announced to any of them  his face darkens and he is filled with gloom 
in his shame he hides himself away from his people  because of the bad news he has been given should he keep her and feel disgraced or bury her in the dust how ill they judge 
the attribute of evil applies to those who do not believe in the hereafter  while to god applies the highest attribute  for he is mighty  the wise 
if god were to take people to task for their wrongdoing  he would not leave even one living creature on earth  but he gives them respite till an appointed time  when their time comes they cannot delay it for an hour  nor can they bring it forward 
they attribute to god what they themselves dislike and their tongues utter the lie that all good things are for themselves without doubt  the fire awaits them  and they shall be hastened on into it 
by god  we have sent messengers before you to other nations but satan made their foul deeds seem fair to them and today he is their patron they shall have a painful punishment 
we have only sent down the book to you so that you can make clear to them that concerning which they differ  and as a guidance and a mercy to people who believe 
god sends down water from the sky and with it revives the earth when it is dead there is truly a sign in this for people who listen 
there is also a lesson for you in cattle from the contents of their bellies  from between the dung and blood  we give you pure milk to drink  pleasant for those who drink it 
 from the fruit of the date palm and the grapes you derive intoxicants as well as wholesome food surely in this there is a sign for men of understanding 
your lord inspired the bee  saying   make your homes in the mountains  in the trees  and also in the structures which men erect 
then feed on every kind of fruit  and follow the trodden paths of your lord   from its belly comes a drink with different colours which provides healing for mankind indeed  in this there is a sign for people who give thought 
god created you  then he shall cause you to die  and some shall have their lives prolonged to abject old age  ceasing to know anything after once having had knowledge god is all knowing and powerful 
god has given some of you more provision than others those who have been given more are unwilling to pass their provision to the servants they possess so that they become their equals will they then deny the favour of god 
god has given you wives from among yourselves  and given you children and grandchildren from your wives  and provided wholesome things for you will they then believe in falsehood and deny god s favours 
they worship  instead of god  things that have no control over their provision from the heavens or the earth in any way  nor do they have any power to do so 
do not compare god with anyone god has knowledge  but you have not 
god makes a comparison between an owned slave possessing no power over anything  and someone to whom we have given plentiful provision  who gives out from it privately and openly are they equal praise be to god  but most people do not know it 
god makes another comparison between two men  one of whom is dumb and cannot do a thing  and is a burden on his master wherever he sends him on an errand  he brings him no good is he equal to someone who commands justice and is on a straight path 
god alone has knowledge of the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth  and the coming of the hour of judgement is like the twinkling of an eye  or even quicker surely god has full power over everything 
god brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers while you knew nothing  and gave you hearing and sight and hearts  so that you might be grateful 
do they not see the birds held poised in the vault of heaven nothing holds them up except god truly  there are signs in this for those who believe 
god has made your houses places of rest for you and made tents for you out of cattle hides  which are light for you to carry  both when you are travelling and when you are staying in one place he provides for you from the wool and fur and hair of cattle  household goods and articles for use for a time 
god has granted you shade out of what he has created  places of shelter in the mountains  garments with which to protect yourselves from the heat and coats of mail to shield you in battle thus he completes his favour to you  so that you may submit wholly to him 
but if they turn away  you are responsible only for conveying the message clearly 
they recognize the favour of god  yet they deny it  and most of them are ungrateful 
on the day when we raise up a witness from every people  those who were bent on denying the truth will not be permitted to put forward excuses  or to make amends 
when the wrongdoers face their punishment  it shall not be lightened for them  nor shall they be granted any reprieve 
when those who associate partners with god see their associate gods  they will say   our lord  these are our associate gods whom we used to call upon instead of you   but they will throw back their words at them  saying    indeed you are liars  
and on that day they will offer total submission to god  and all that they used to devise will fail them 
upon all who were bent on denying the truth and who turned others away from the path of god  we will heap punishment upon punishment  in return for all the corruption that they brought about 
the day will come when we raise up in every people a witness against them from amongst themselves  and we will bring you as a witness against these people we have sent down the book to you to make everything clear  a guidance  and a mercy  and glad tidings for those who submit to god 
god commands justice  kindness and giving their due to near relatives  and he forbids all shameful deeds  and injustice and transgression he admonishes you so that you may take heed 
fulfill the covenant of god when you have made one  and do not break your pledges after their confirmation indeed you have made god your surety  for god knows all that you do 
do not  like the woman who unravels her yarn after its strands have been firmly spun  use your oaths as a means of deceiving one another  just because one community could become bigger than another god is only testing you by means of this on the day of resurrection he will make it clear to you what you differed about 
had god pleased  he would have united you in one community  but he lets go astray whoever he will  and guides whoever he will  and you will surely be called upon to account for all your actions 
do not use your oaths to deceive each other lest any foot should slip after being firmly placed and lest you should taste the penalty for having hindered others from the path of god  for then you will have a terrible punishment 
do not sell god s covenant for a paltry price what is with god is better for you if you only knew 
what you have shall pass away  but what is with god is lasting we will certainly give those who are patient their reward according to the best of their actions 
to whoever does good deeds  man or woman  and is a believer  we shall assuredly give a good life  and we will bestow upon them their reward according to the best of their works 
when you read the quran  seek god s protection from satan  the rejected one 
surely  he has no power over those who believe and put their trust in their lord 
he has power only over those who are willing to follow him and associate others with god 
when we substitute one revelation for another  and god knows best what he reveals  they say   you are but a fabricator   indeed  most of them have no knowledge 
say   the holy spirit has brought it down as truth from your lord  so that he may strengthen those who believe  and also as guidance and as good tidings for those who submit  
indeed  we know what they say   it is only a human being who imparts all this to him   but the tongue of him to whom they point is foreign  whereas this is plain arabic speech 
god will not guide those who will not believe in the signs of god  and theirs will be a painful punishment 
only those fabricate lies concerning god who do not believe in the signs of god  and these are the liars 
as for one who denies god after he has believed  with the exception of one who is forced to do it  while his heart rests securely in faith  but one who opens his heart to a denial of truth shall incur the wrath of god  such as these will have a terrible punishment 
this is because they prefer the life of this world to the hereafter and because god does not guide those who deny the truth 
these are the ones upon whose hearts and hearing and sight god has set a seal it is they who are heedless 
and in the life to come  they will surely be the losers 
surely  your lord will be forgiving and merciful towards those who migrated after persecution and strove hard for the cause of god and remained steadfast 
on the day each soul will come pleading for itself  and every soul will be repaid according to whatever it has done  and they will not be wronged 
god makes an example of a town that was secure and at ease  with provisions coming to it abundantly from every quarter then it showed ingratitude for god s blessings and god afflicted it with hunger and fear because of what they did 
there came to them a messenger from among themselves  but they rejected him as false  so punishment overtook them  as they were wrongdoers 
so eat the lawful and good things which god has provided for you  and be thankful for the blessing of god  if it is him you worship 
he has forbidden you only carrion  blood and the flesh of swine  also any flesh consecrated in the name of any but god but if anyone is forced by dire necessity  not desiring it or exceeding his immediate need  god is forgiving and merciful towards him 
do not falsely declare   this is lawful  and this is forbidden   so as to invent a lie against god surely  those who invent a lie against god do not prosper   
their enjoyment of this life is brief  and they shall have a painful punishment 
we forbade the jews those things we told you about before we did not wrong them  rather they wronged themselves 
surely  your lord is most forgiving and ever merciful towards those who do evil in ignorance and truly repent thereafter and make amends 
abraham was a community in himself devoted to god and true in faith  he was not one of the polytheists 
he was thankful for his blessings god chose him and guided him to a straight path 
we gave him blessings in this world  and in the hereafter he shall be among the righteous 
then we revealed our will to you o muhammad   saying   follow the religion of abraham  the upright in faith  he was not one of the polytheists  
the sabbath was only enjoined on those who differed about it your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection regarding the things about which they differed 
call to the way of your lord with wisdom and fair exhortation and reason with them in a way that is best your lord knows best those who have strayed away from his path  and he knows best those who are rightly guided 
if you want to retaliate  retaliate to the same degree as the injury done to you but if you are patient  it is better to be so 
endure with patience  truly  your patience is possible only with the help of god do not grieve for them  or feel distressed because of their plottings 
for god is with those who are righteous and those who do good 
holy is he who took his servant by night from the sacred place of worship at makkah to the remote house of worship at jerusalem    the precincts of which we have blessed  so that we might show him some of our signs surely  it is he who is all hearing  and all seeing 
we gave moses the book and made it a guide for the children of israel saying   do not take anyone besides me as a guardian 
you who are the descendants of those whom we carried in the ark with noah he was a truly thankful servant  
we forewarned the children of israel in the scripture   twice you shall commit evil in the land you shall become great transgressors  
when the time of the first of these warnings came  we sent against you servants of ours  of great might  who ravaged your homes so the warning was fulfilled 
and after a time we allowed you to prevail over them once again and aided you with wealth and offspring and made you greater in number 
 we said    if you persevere in doing good  you will be doing good to yourselves  but if you do evil  it will go against you   when the time of the second warning came  we roused against you others to disgrace you utterly and to enter the place of worship as they had entered it before  utterly destroying all that they laid their hands on 
we said   your lord may yet have mercy on you  but if you do the same again  so shall we  we have made hell a prison for those who deny the truth  
surely  this quran guides to the most upright way and gives good news to the believers who do good deeds  so that they will have a great reward
and warns those who deny the life to come with grievous punishment 
yet man asks for evil as eagerly as he should ask for good truly  man is indeed hasty 
we have made the night and the day as two signs we blotted out the sign of night and made the sign of the day illuminating  so that you may seek the bounty of your lord and learn to compute the seasons and the years we have set everything forth in detail 
we have tied the fate of every man about his neck  and we shall produce a book for him on resurrection day that he will find spread open 
it will say   read your record  today there will be none but yourself to call you to account  
whoever chooses to follow the right path  follows it for his own good  and whoever goes astray  goes astray at his own peril  no bearer of burdens shall bear the burdens of another nor do we punish until we have sent forth a messenger to forewarn them 
when we decide to destroy a town  we command the affluent section of its people  but they transgress therein  thus the word sentence of punishment is justified  then we destroy the town utterly 
how many generations have we destroyed since noah s time your lord is well aware of the sins of his servants and observes them all 
we give whatever we will to whoever desires immediate gains  but then we have prepared hell for him which he will enter  disgraced and rejected 
anyone who desires the hereafter and makes a proper effort to achieve it  being a true believer  shall find favour with god for his endeavours 
upon all  both these who desire the world and those who desire the hereafter we bestow the bounty of your lord  none shall be denied the bounty of your lord   
see how we have exalted some above others in the present life yet the hereafter shall be greater in degrees of rank and greater in excellence 
do not set up any other deity beside god  lest you incur disgrace  and be forsaken 
your lord has commanded that you should worship none but him  and show kindness to your parents if either or both of them attain old age with you  say no word of contempt to them and do not rebuke them  but always speak gently to them
and treat them with humility and tenderness and say   lord  be merciful to them both  as they raised me up when i was little  
your lord knows best what is in your hearts  if you are righteous  he is most forgiving to those who constantly turn to him 
give to your relatives their due  and also to the needy and the wayfarer yet do not spend extravagantly 
spendthrifts are the brothers of satan  and satan is ever ungrateful to his lord   
but if  while waiting for your lord s bounty which you are expecting  you turn them down  then at least speak to them kindly 
be neither miserly  nor so open handed that you suffer reproach and become destitute 
your lord gives abundantly to whom he will and sparingly to whom he pleases he is informed and observant about his servants 
you shall not kill your offspring for fear of want it is we who provide for them  and for you indeed  killing them is a great sin 
do not commit adultery  for it is an indecent thing and an evil course 
do not take life which god has made inviolate    except by right if anyone is killed wrongfully  we have given authority to his heirs to demand retribution  but let them not transgress the prescribed limits in exacting retribution  for then he will be assisted by the law 
do not go near the orphans property  except with the best of intentions  until they reach maturity keep your promises  you will be called to account for every promise which you have made 
give full measure  when you measure  and weigh with accurate scales that is fair  and better in the end 
do not follow what you do not know  for the ear and the eye and the heart shall all be called to account 
do not walk proudly on the earth you cannot cleave the earth  nor can you rival the mountains in height 
all that is evil in the sight of your lord  and is detestable 
this is part of the wisdom that your lord has revealed to you do not set up any other deity with god  lest you be cast into hell  condemned and rejected 
what  has your lord then favoured you with sons and himself adopted females from among the angels what you say is monstrous 
we have explained the truth in this quran in various ways  so that they may take heed  but it has only increased their aversion 
say   if there were other deities along with him  as they claim  then they would surely have tried to find a way to the lord of the throne 
glory be to him  exalted above all that they say 
the seven heavens and the earth and all who dwell therein glorify him there is not a single thing but glorifies him with his praise  but you do not understand their glorification truly  he is forbearing and most forgiving  
when you recite the quran  we place an invisible barrier between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter 
we put veils over their hearts to prevent them from comprehending it  and we afflict their ears with deafness when you mention your one and only lord in your recitation of the quran  they turn their backs in aversion 
we are fully aware of what they wish to hear when they listen to you  and what they say when they converse in private  and when the wrongdoers say   you are only following a man who is bewitched  
see to what they liken you  but they are lost and cannot find the right path 
what  they say   when we are turned to bones and dust  shall we be restored to life  
say    yes even if you turned to stones or iron 
or any other substance which you think unlikely to be given life   then they will ask   who is it that shall restore us to life   answer them   he who created you the first time   they will then shake their heads at you and say   when will that be   say   it may well be very soon  
on that day he will call you  and you will answer by praising him  thinking that you have stayed for only a little while  
tell my servants that they should always say what is best satan stirs up discord among them surely  satan is an outright enemy to man 
your lord is fully aware of you he may show you mercy if he will  or punish you if he will we have not sent you as their guardian 
your lord knows best about everyone in the heavens and on the earth we gave some prophets more than others  we gave david the psalms 
call upon those you claim to be deities besides god and you will know that they have no power to remove affliction from you or to bring about any change that you may desire 
those whom they invoke are themselves seeking a way of approach to their lord  vying with each other to be near him they hope for his mercy and fear his punishment surely  the punishment of your lord is to be feared 
there is not a town community but we shall destroy or sternly punish it before the day of judgement that is recorded in the book 
nothing has prevented us from sending signs  except the fact that previous peoples denied them we gave the people of thamud the she camel as a clear sign  yet they mistreated her we give signs only by way of warning 
we told you that your lord encompasses mankind we granted the vision which we showed you  as well as the tree that is cursed in the quran  only as a test for mankind we warn them  but this only increases their insolence 
when we said to the angels   prostrate yourselves before adam   they all prostrated themselves except iblis he said   am i to prostrate myself to someone you have created out of clay  
and further said   do you see this being whom you have exalted above me if you reprieve me until the day of resurrection  i will bring all but a few of his descendents under my sway  
god said   go away  hell will be your reward and the reward of any of them who follow you    an ample recompense 
go ahead and entice whomsoever of them you can  with your voice  and mount assaults against them with your cavalry and infantry and be their partner in wealth and offspring  and make promises to them  satan promises nothing but delusion 
but over my true servants you shall have no power your lord will be their all sufficient guardian  
your lord is he who causes the ships to move onward for you across the sea  so that you may go in quest of his bounty  he is most merciful towards you 
when danger threatens you at sea  you call upon him  and forget all others you are wont to invoke but when he brings you safe to land  you turn away from him man is ever ungrateful 
do you then feel secure against his causing you to be swallowed up by the earth when you are back on land  or his sending a deadly sand storm upon you then you will find none to protect you 
or do you feel secure against his sending you back to sea once again  and raising a fierce gale against you and causing you to drown in requital for your ingratitude you will find no helper against us there 
we have honoured the children of adam  and have borne them on the land and the sea  given them for sustenance things which are good and pure  and exalted them above many of our creatures 
the day will surely come when we shall summon every people with their leader then those who are given their records in their right hands will read their records eagerly and shall not in the least be wronged 
but whoever has been blind in this life will be blind in the life to come  and still farther astray from the path of truth 
they indeed sought to entice you away from what we revealed to you  hoping that you might invent something else in our name  and then they would have accepted you as a close friend 
if we had not made you stand firm  you would almost have inclined towards them a little 
in that case  we should have inflicted a double punishment in this life  and a double punishment after death then you would have found no one to help you against us 
indeed they came near to unsettling you  so that they might expel you from the land  but in that case they themselves would not have stayed on for very long after you 
such was our way with the messengers we sent before you  and you will find no change in our ways 
say your prayers from the decline of the sun  until nightfall  and at dawn    the recitation at dawn is indeed witnessed 
and during the night wake up and pray  as an additional prayer  it may well be that your lord will raise you to a station of praise and glory  
say   lord  grant me an honourable entrance and an honourable exit  and sustain me with your power  
say   truth has come and falsehood has disappeared falsehood is always bound to wither away  
we send down in the quran that which is healing and a mercy to those who believe  as for the evil doers  it only increases their loss 
when we bestow a favour upon a person  he turns his back and draws aside  and when evil afflicts him he gives himself up to despair 
say to them   everyone acts in his own way  and your lord knows best who is rightly guided  
they question you about the spirit say   the spirit is at my lord s command  and you have been granted but little knowledge  
if we pleased  we would certainly take away that which we have revealed to you  then you would find no guardian for you against us 
except through the special mercy of your lord his favours towards you has been great indeed 
say   if all men and jinn gathered together to produce the like of this quran  they could not produce one like it  however much they helped one another  
in this quran  we have set out all kinds of examples for people  yet most of them persist in denying the truth 
they declare   we will never believe in you until you cause a spring to flow for us from the earth 
or you have a garden of date palms and vines  and cause streams to flow plentifully in the midst of them 
or you cause the heavens to fall down on us in pieces  as you have claimed  or you bring god and the angels before us face to face 
or you have a house made of gold  or you ascend to heaven  and we will not believe in your ascension until you send down to us a book that we can read   tell them   holy is my lord i am but a human being sent as a messenger  
nothing has prevented men from believing whenever guidance came to them  save their query   has god sent a human being as a messenger  
say   if there had been angels walking around on earth  we would have sent an angel down from heaven as a messenger for them  
say   god suffices as a witness between me and you all he is informed about and observant of his servants  
those whom god guides are the truly guided  and for those whom he lets go astray  you will find no helper besides him  on the day of judgement we shall gather them together  lying upon their faces  blind  dumb and deaf their abode shall be hell every time the fire dies down  we will make it blaze up again for them 
that is their recompense  because they rejected our signs and asked   when we are reduced to bones and dust  shall we indeed be raised up as a new creation  
do they not see that god  who has created heavens and earth  is able to create the like of them he has appointed a definite term for them  there is no doubt about it  but the wrongdoers persist in denying the truth 
say   even if you possessed the treasures of the mercy of my lord  you would surely hold them back for fear of spending man is indeed niggardly  
we did indeed give moses nine manifest signs  you can enquire from the children of israel when he came to them  pharaoh said to him   moses  i can see that you are bewitched  
he said   you know full well that none has sent down these signs but the lord of the heavens and the earth as eye opening evidence indeed  pharaoh  i can see that you are doomed  
so he resolved to scare them out of the land  but we drowned him along with all those who were with him 
thereafter  we said to the israelites   dwell in the land when the promise of the hereafter comes to be fulfilled  we shall assemble you all together  
we have revealed the quran with the truth  and with the truth it has come down we have sent you forth only to give good news and to give warning   
we have revealed the quran bit by bit so that you may recite it to the people slowly and with deliberation we have imparted it by gradual revelation 
say to them   you may believe in it or not those to whom knowledge had been revealed  fall on their faces in prostration when it is recited 
and say   glory to our lord  our lord s promise is bound to be fulfilled  
they fall down upon their faces weeping  and the quran increases their humility  
say   whether you call on god or on the merciful one  his are the finest names   pray neither in too loud a voice nor in silence  but between these two extremes seek a middle way
and say   all praise is due to god who has never begotten a son and who has no partner in his kingdom  nor does anyone aid him because of any weakness of his proclaim his greatness  
praise be to god who has sent down to his servant    the book  which is free from any ambiguity
and which rightly directs  to give warning of stern punishment from him  and to proclaim to the believers who do righteous deeds that they shall have an excellent recompense 
wherein they will remain in a state of bliss forever 
and to warn those who say   god has taken to himself a son  
they have no knowledge of this  nor did their forefathers have any either what they say is monstrous  they are merely uttering falsehoods 
perhaps you may destroy yourself with grief if they do not believe in this message 
we have adorned the earth with attractive things  so that we may test mankind as to which one is best in conduct 
but we shall reduce all this to barren waste 
do you think that the men of the cave and the inscription were one of our wondrous signs 
when the young men sought refuge in the cave  they said   our lord  grant us your special mercy and give us right guidance in our affair  
then we caused them to fall into a deep sleep for many years inside the cave 
then we woke them up again so that we might see which of the two groups would better calculate the time they had stayed there 
we shall tell you their story as it really was they were young men who believed in their lord  and on whom we bestowed further guidance 
we strengthened their hearts  when they rose up and declared   our lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth never shall we call upon any deity other than him  for that would be an outrageous thing to do 
these people of ours have taken deities other than him why do they not produce clear evidence about them who is more wicked than the man who invents a falsehood against god 
now that you have withdrawn from them and from all that they worship instead of god  take refuge in that cave  your lord will extend his mercy to you and will make fitting provision for you in your situation 
the sun could be observed to incline away from their cave on the right  as it rose  and to turn away from them on the left  when it set  while they lay in the wide space inside the cave this is one of the signs of god he whom god guides is rightly guided  but for him whom he lets go astray  you will find no helper or guide 
you would have thought they were awake  though they lay asleep we turned them over  to the right and the left  while their dog lay at the cave s entrance with legs outstretched had you looked down and seen them  you would have surely turned your back and fled in terror 
in the course of time  we raised them up again so that they might question one another one of them asked   how long have you stayed here   they said   we have stayed a day  or part of a day   but others said   your lord knows best how long you have stayed here let one of you go then with these silver coins to the town  and let him find out what food is purest there  and bring you back a supply of it let him conduct himself with caution and not disclose your whereabouts to anyone 
for if they find you out  they will stone you to death  or force you back into their faith in that case you would never prosper  
thus we disclosed things to them so that they might know that god s promise was true and there was no doubt about the hour judgement day the people argued about them among themselves they said   build a monument over them their lord knows best concerning them   those who prevailed in their affair said   let us surely build a place of worship over them  
some will say   they were three  the fourth was their dog   and others will say   they were five  the sixth was their dog   guessing at random and yet others say   they were seven  the eighth was their dog   say   my lord knows best their number   only a few know anything about them therefore  do not enter into controversies over them  nor seek information about them from any of them 
never say of anything   i shall certainly do this tomorrow  
without adding    if god so wills   remember your lord whenever you might forget and say   i trust my lord will guide me to that which is even nearer to the right path than this  
 some say    they stayed in their cave three hundred years   and to that some have added another nine years 
say   god knows best how long they stayed in it   only god has knowledge of the unseen in the heavens and on the earth how well he sees and how well he hears  man has no other guardian besides him he allows none to share his sovereignty 
proclaim what has been revealed to you from your lord s book none can change his words you shall find no refuge besides him 
keep yourself attached to those who call on their lord  morning and evening  seeking his pleasure  and do not let your eyes turn away from them  desiring the attraction of worldly life  and do not obey one whose heart we have made heedless of our remembrance  one who pursues his own whims and becomes dissolute 
say   this is the truth from your lord let him who will  believe in it  and him who will  deny it   for the wrongdoers we have prepared a fire which will cover them like a canopy  and if they beg for water  they will be given water as hot as molten lead  which will scald their faces  how dreadful a drink  and how evil a resting place 
as for those who believe and do good deeds  we do not let the reward of anyone who does a good deed go to waste 
they shall dwell in the gardens of eternity where rivers flow at their feet reclining upon raised couches  they will be adorned with bracelets of gold  and will wear green robes of fine silk and heavy brocade an excellent reward and an excellent resting place 
recite to them the parable of two men  one of them we provided with two vineyards which we surrounded with date palms  and placed a field of grain in between 
each garden produced its fruit and did not fail to yield its best  we even caused a river to gush forth in the midst of them 
and so he had fruit in abundance while conversing with his companion  he said   i am wealthier than you are  and have a bigger following  
having thus harmed his own soul  he entered his garden saying   i do not think this will ever perish 
and i do not believe that the hour will ever come even if i am returned to my lord  i shall surely find a better place than this  
his companion replied  in the course of their discussion   do you deny him who created you from dust  from a small drop of fluid  then formed you into a man 
but as far as i am concerned  god alone is my lord and i set up no partners with him 
when you entered your garden  why did you not say   that which god wills will surely come to pass   there is no power save with god   although you see i have less wealth and offspring than you 
my lord may well give me a garden better than yours and send down thunderbolts from heaven upon your vineyard  turning it into a barren waste 
or its water may sink into the earth  so that you will never be able to find it again  
so it was  and all his fruit was destroyed the vines had all fallen down on their trellises  and their owner wrung his hands  bewailing all that he had spent on his garden he said   would that i had not associated anyone with my lord  
he had no party to help him against god  nor was he able to defend himself 
the only support is from god  the true god he is the best in rewarding and the best in respect of the final outcome 
give them an example about worldly life it is like the vegetation of the earth that thrives when watered by the rain  which we send down from the sky  and then it all becomes stubble which the wind blows away god has power over all things 
wealth and children are an ornament of the life of this world but deeds of lasting merit are better rewarded by your lord and a far better source of hope 
the day we shall make the mountains move and you will see the earth laid bare  and we shall gather all mankind together and shall not leave any one of them behind 
they will be ranged before your lord  standing in rows and he will say to them   now you have come to us as we created you at first but you supposed that we would not appoint the time for the fulfillment of our promise to you  
the book of deeds will be placed before them and you will see the guilty apprehensive about its contents they will say   woe to us  what a record this is  it does not leave any deed  small or large  unaccounted for   they will find everything they ever did laid in front of them  your lord will not be unjust to anyone 
when we said to the angels   prostrate yourselves before adam   all prostrated themselves except satan he was one of the jinn and he disobeyed his lord s command do you then take him and his offspring as protectors instead of me  despite their enmity towards you this is an evil exchange for the wrongdoers 
i did not call them to witness at the creation of the heavens and the earth  nor at their own creation  i do not take as my helpers those who lead others astray 
on that day he will say to them   call on those whom you thought to be my partners   and they will call on them  but their prayer will not be heard  and we shall place a barrier of enmity between them 
the guilty shall see the fire and realize that they are going to fall into it  they shall find no way of escape from it 
we have explained in various ways in this quran  for the benefit of mankind  all kinds of examples  but man is most contentious 
nothing prevents people from believing when they are given guidance or from asking forgiveness of their lord  but the fact that the fate of the previous peoples should befall them or to have the punishment come upon them face to face 
we only send the messengers to bring good news and to give warning those who deny use fallacious arguments to nullify the truth  treating my revelations and my warnings as a jest 
who is more wicked than he who has been reminded of the revelations of his lord  then turns away from them and forgets what his own hands have done we have cast veils over their hearts lest they understand our words  and made them hard of hearing call them as you may to the right path  they shall never be guided 
your lord is the forgiving one  the possessor of mercy if he had to take them to task for the wrongs they have done  he would have hastened their punishment they have an appointed time beyond which there will be no escape for them 
we destroyed these communities when they went on doing wrong  and we appointed a time for their destruction 
recall how moses said to his servant   i shall not give up until i reach the place where both seas meet  even if it takes me years  
but when at last they came to the land where the two seas met  they forgot their fish and it swiftly made its way into the sea 
after they had passed the place  moses said to his young companion   bring us our morning meal  we have indeed been fatigued by this journey  
he replied   did you see when we were resting by the rock  that i forgot the fish satan made me forget it  so i did not mention it it made its way to the sea in a miraculous way  
moses said   that is just what we were looking for   so they went back the way they had come 
and they found one of our servants to whom we had granted our mercy and had given a knowledge from ourself 
moses said to him   may i follow you  so that you may guide me by what you have been taught  
he replied   you will not be able to bear with me patiently 
how could you be patient in matters beyond your knowledge  
moses said   god willing  you will find me patient  and i will not disobey you in any thing  
he said   well then  if you would follow me  do not ask me about anything till i speak of it to you  
so they set out  but  when they got into a boat  the man made a hole in it moses exclaimed   have you made a hole in the boat to drown the people in it you have indeed done a dreadful thing  
he replied   did i not tell you that you would never be able to bear with me patiently  
he said   do not take me to task for what i have forgotten  and do not be hard on me on account of what i have done  
so they travelled on then they met a young boy and the man killed him moses said   have you slain an innocent person without his having slain anyone indeed  you have done a terrible thing  
the man said   did i not tell you that you would not be able to have any patience with me  
moses replied   if i ever ask you about anything after this  do not let me accompany you i will have given you sufficient excuse  
so they went on until they came to a town they asked its people for food  but were refused hospitality they found a wall in the town which was about to fall down his companion buttressed it and moses said   had you wished  you could have demanded payment for your labours  
he answered   this is where you and i must part company but first i will tell you the meaning of the things you could not bear with patiently 
the boat belonged to some poor people who made their living from the sea i wanted to damage it because there was a king coming behind them who was seizing every boat by force 
as for the youth  his parents were believers and we feared that he would trouble them by rebellion and denial of truth 
we wanted their lord to replace him with someone purer than him and more compassionate 
the wall belonged to two young orphans in the town whose father had been a righteous man  and a treasure of theirs lay underneath it so your lord wanted them to come of age and then to dig up their treasure as a mercy from him i did not do it of my own accord that is the explanation of the things about which you were not able to restrain yourself 
they will ask you about dhu l qarnayn say   i will give you an account of him  
we established him in the land  and gave him the means to achieve all things 
he travelled on a certain road 
until  when he reached the setting of the sun  he found it setting in a spring of murky water and near it he found some people we said   dhu l qarnayn  you can either punish them or else you can treat them with gentleness  
he said   we shall certainly punish him who does wrong  then he shall be brought back to his lord who will punish him with a grievous punishment 
but whoever believes and does good works shall have a good reward and we shall facilitate his matter by our command  
then he followed yet another path 
until he came to the rising place of the sun  where he found it rising on a people for whom we had provided no shelter from it 
thus indeed it was we had full knowledge of him 
then he followed still another path 
until he came between two mountains he found beside them a people who could scarcely understand a word of his language 
they said   o dhu l qarnayn  gog and magog are causing corruption in the land  so may we pay you tribute on condition that you set a barrier between us and them  
he said   what my lord has given me is better than any tribute help me with a force of labourers and i will erect a barrier between you and them 
bring me blocks of iron   then  when he had filled the gap between the mountain sides he said    now blow on the fire with your bellows   when the iron blocks were red with heat  he said   bring me molten brass to pour on them  
so they gog and magog were not able to scale it  nor were they able to bore through it 
and he said   this is a mercy from my lord but when the promise of my lord comes to pass  he will level it to dust my lord s promise is ever true  
on that day  we shall let them surge against each other like waves and then the trumpet will be blown and we shall gather them all together 
on that day we shall lay hell bare before those who deny the truth 
who have turned a blind eye to my reminder and a deaf ear to my warning 
do those who deny the truth  think that they can make my servants patrons instead of me we have reserved hell as a lodging for those who deny the truth 
say   shall i tell you of those who will lose the most through their actions 
they are those whose efforts have been wasted in the life of the world while they thought they were doing good 
they are those who deny their lord s signs and the meeting with him   so their works are in vain  and we shall give them no weight on the day of resurrection 
hell will be their reward  because they denied the truth  and made a jest of my signs and my messengers 
those who believe and do good works shall have the gardens of paradise for their abode 
they shall forever dwell in the gardens of paradise  desiring no change 
tell them   if the ocean became ink for writing the words of my lord  surely the ocean would be exhausted before the words of my lord came to an end    even if we were to add another ocean to it  
say   i am only a human being like yourselves it is revealed to me that your god is one god so let him who hopes to meet his lord do good deeds and let him associate no one else in the worship of his lord  
kaf ha ya ayn sad 
this is an account of your lord s mercy bestowed upon his servant zachariah 
when he called upon his lord in low tones  saying 
lord  my bones have weakened and my head has turned hoary with age  but never  lord  have i been disappointed in my prayer to you 
now i fear my kinsmen when i am gone i have no hope of their continuing my mission for my wife is barren  so grant me a successor from yourself 
to be my heir and to be the heir of the blessings of the house of jacob  and make him  o my lord  acceptable to you  
zachariah  we bring you good news of a son whose name shall be john we have not given such a name to anyone before 
my lord  said zachariah    how shall i have a son when my wife is barren and i have reached such extreme old age  
he said   it will be so  your lord says  it is easy for me for i created you when you were nothing before  
he said   my lord  grant me a sign   he said   your sign will be that you will not speak to anyone for three successive days and nights  although sound in body  
then zachariah came forth from the shrine to his people and told them by signs to glorify the lord morning and evening 
to john we said   hold fast the book   and while he was still a child  we bestowed upon him wisdom 
and tenderness of heart and purity he was pious 
and dutiful towards his parents and was not haughty or disobedient 
peace be on him on the day of his birth  and on the day of his death  and peace will be on him on the day he is raised up to life again 
recount in the book how mary withdrew from her people to an eastern place
and kept herself in seclusion from them we sent her our angel  who presented himself to her as a full grown human being 
when she saw him  she said   i seek refuge in the compassionate god from you  do not come near if you fear the lord  
i am only the messenger of your lord  he replied  i shall bestow upon you the gift of a son endowed with purity  
she said   how can i have a son when no man has touched me  and neither have i been unchaste  
 the angel replied   so shall it be  your lord says  this is easy for me  and we shall make him a sign to people and a blessing  from us this has been decreed  
so she conceived him and withdrew with him to a distant place 
the pains of labour drove her to the trunk of a date palm she said   oh  if only i had died before this and passed into oblivion  
but a voice called out to her from below   do not despair your lord has provided a brook that runs at your feet 
and if you shake the trunk of this palm tree  it will drop fresh ripe dates on you 
eat and drink and rejoice and if you see any human being say  i have vowed a fast of silence to the gracious god  and will not speak with any human being today  
carrying her child  she brought him to her people they said   o mary  you have indeed done something terrible 
sister of aaron  your father was not an evil man  nor was your mother an unchaste woman  
she pointed to the child they said   how shall we talk to someone who is a child in the cradle  
 but he said   i am god s servant he has given me the book and made me a prophet 
he has made me blessed wherever i may be  and has enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving throughout my life 
he has made me dutiful toward my mother  and he has not made me arrogant or wicked 
blessed was i on the day i was born  and blessed i shall be on the day i die and on the day i am raised to life again  
such was jesus  the son of mary that is the whole truth  about which they still dispute 
it does not befit the majesty of god that he should beget a son glory be to him  he is far above that  when he decrees something  he says only   be   and it is 
god is my lord and your lord  so worship him alone that is the right path 
yet different groups differed among themselves how awful it will be for those who have rejected the truth when a dreadful day arrives 
how sharp of hearing  how sharp of sight they will be when they come to us but today  these evil doers are obviously lost in error 
warn them of the coming of the day of remorse  when everything will have been decided  while they are heedless and do not believe 
it is we who will inherit the earth and all who dwell upon it  they shall all return to us 
also recount the story of abraham in the book he was a man of truth  and a prophet 
he said to his father   why do you worship something that can neither hear nor see nor benefit you in any way 
father  i have been given some knowledge which has not come to you  so follow me  i shall guide you along a straight path 
father  do not worship satan    for  truly  satan is a rebel against the most gracious one 
father  indeed i fear lest a punishment from the gracious one afflict you  and you become a friend of satan  
 his father said   do you reject my deities  abraham if you do not desist  i shall surely stone you to death keep out of my way  
abraham replied   peace be on you  i will pray to my lord for your forgiveness  he has indeed been gracious to me 
i will separate myself from you and from whatever you call upon besides god  and i will pray only to my lord it may well be that  in calling on my lord  i will not be disappointed  
so when he had separated himself from them and from what they worshipped besides god  we bestowed on him isaac and jacob  and we made each of them a prophet 
we granted them our mercy and bestowed on them true and high renown 
tell also of moses in the book he was indeed a chosen one  and was a messenger and a prophet 
we called out to him from the right side of the mount and made him draw near to be in close communion with us 
and we gave him as his helper  out of our mercy  his brother aaron  having made him a prophet 
tell also of ishmael in the book he was true to his promise and was a messenger and a prophet 
he exhorted his people to prayer and almsgiving  and his lord was pleased with him 
tell also of idris in the book he was a man of truth and a prophet 
we raised him to a high position 
these are the ones whom god has favoured  the prophets from among the descendants of adam and of those whom we carried in the ark with noah  the descendants of abraham  of israel  and of those whom we have guided and chosen for when the revelations of the merciful were recited to them  they fell down  prostrating themselves and weeping 
but then they were succeeded by generations who neglected their prayers and were driven by their own desires they will assuredly meet with destruction 
except for those who repent and believe and do good deeds these will enter heaven  and they will not be wronged in the least 
theirs shall be the gardens of eden  which the all merciful has promised to his servants without their having seen them  and most surely his promise shall be fulfilled 
they will not hear therein anything vain  only greetings of peace they will receive their provision there morning and evening 
that is the garden which we will grant to those of our servants who have been god fearing 
we never descend except at your lord s command what is before us and behind us and all that lies between belong to him your lord is not forgetful 
he is the lord of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between the two so worship him alone and be steadfast in his worship do you know of anyone equal to him in his attributes 
man asks   when i am once dead  shall i be raised to life  
but does man not remember that we created him when he was nothing before 
by your lord  we shall most surely gather them and the devils too  and bring them close to hell on their knees 
then we shall carry off from every group those who were most stubborn in their opposition to the gracious one 
we surely know best those most deserving of the fires of hell 
and there is not one of you but shall pass through it  a decree from your lord which must be fulfilled 
then we shall save those who feared god  but the wrongdoers shall be left there on their knees 
when our clear revelations are recited to them  those who deny the truth say to the faithful   which of the two sides is better in respect of position and makes a more impressive assembly  
we have destroyed so many generations before them  who surpassed them in material power and splendour 
say   the gracious one grants respite for a time to those who are in error until  when they are confronted with what they are promised  either in punishment in the world or in the approach of the hour  they will realize who is worse in respect of position and who is weaker in resources  
god increases his guidance to those who follow guidance  and lasting good works are better in the sight of your lord and are most rewarding 
have you seen him who denies the truth in our revelations and says   i shall certainly be given wealth and children  
has he looked to the unseen  or has he made a pledge to the merciful one 
indeed not we shall record what he says and shall prolong the punishment for him 
we shall inherit all that he boasts of  and he will come to us all alone 
they have taken other deities besides god  so that they may be a source of strength for them 
but they shall reject their worship and turn against them 
do you not see that we have appointed devils to incite those who deny the truth to disobedience 
so take no hasty action against them  their days are numbered 
the day will surely come when we shall gather the god fearing like honoured guests before the compassionate god
and we shall drive the sinful like a thirsty herd into hell 
no one will have power to intercede  except for those who have permission from the lord of mercy 
they say   the gracious one has begotten a son  
assuredly  you have uttered a monstrous falsehood 
the heavens might well nigh burst thereat  and the earth break asunder  and the mountains fall down in pieces 
because they ascribe a son to the gracious one 
it does not become the majesty of the compassionate god to take to himself a son 
there is none in the heavens or on the earth but shall return to the merciful in utter submission 
he has counted them and numbered them precisely 
each one of them shall come to him one by one on the day of judgement 
the lord of mercy will bestow affection upon those who believe and perform righteous deeds 
we have made it the quran easy  in your own language prophet   so that you may convey glad news to the righteous and give warning to a stubborn people 
how many generations we have destroyed before them  can you find a single one of them alive now  or hear so much as a whisper from them 
ta ha
we have not sent the quran down to you to distress you 
but only as an exhortation for him who fears god 
it is a revelation from him who has created the earth and the high heavens 
the all merciful settled on the throne 
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth  and whatever lies in between them  and all that lies under the ground 
whether you speak aloud or in a low voice   he hears all  for he knows your secrets and what is even more hidden 
god  there is no deity but him his are the most excellent names 
have you heard the story of moses 
when he saw a fire  he said to his family   wait here i can see a fire perhaps i can bring you a brand from it  or find some guidance at the fire  
when he came close to it  a voice called out   moses 
i am your lord  take off your sandals  for you are in the sacred valley of tuwa 
i have chosen you so listen to what is being revealed 
i am god there is no deity save me  so worship me alone  and say your prayers in my remembrance 
the hour is coming but i choose to keep it hidden  so that every human being may be recompensed in accordance with his labours 
do not let anyone who does not believe in it and follows his own desires turn you away from it and so bring you to ruin  
what do you have in your right hand  moses 
he replied   it is my staff i lean on it  and with it  i beat down the leaves for my flock  i also have other uses for it  
god said   moses  cast it down  
so he threw it down  and all of a sudden  it turned into a fast moving serpent 
god said   take hold of it  and have no fear  we shall return it to its former state 
put your hand under your armpit  it will come out shining white  without any blemish this shall be another sign 
we shall show you some of our greatest signs 
go to pharaoh  he has transgressed all bounds  
moses said   my lord  open up my heart 
and make my task easy for me 
loosen the knot in my tongue 
so that they may understand my speech 
and appoint for me a helper from among my family 
aaron  my brother 
strengthen me through him 
and let him share my task 
so that we may glorify you much
and remember you much 
you are surely watching over us 
god said   you have been granted your request  moses  
indeed  we showed our favour to you before also 
when we revealed our will to your mother  saying 
 put him into a chest  then cast it into the river the river will cast it on to the bank  and there he shall be taken up by an enemy of mine and his i showered my love on you so that you might be reared under my watchful eye 
recall when your sister walked along and said   shall i guide you to one who will take care of him   thus we returned you to your mother  so that her eyes might be cooled and that she might not grieve and you killed a man and we delivered you from sorrow we tested you with various trials you stayed for a number of years among the people of midian  then you came upto the standard  moses 
i have chosen you for myself 
go  you and your brother  with my signs  and do not be remiss in remembering me 
go  both of you to pharaoh  for he has transgressed all bounds 
but speak gently to him  perhaps he may yet take heed or even feel afraid  
they both said   our lord  we fear that he may commit some excess against us  or exceed all bounds in transgression  
god said   do not fear  i am with you both i hear and i see 
go to him and say  we are both messengers from your lord let the children of israel go with us  and do not oppress them we have brought you a sign from your lord  and may peace be upon whoever follows the right guidance 
it has been revealed to us that punishment shall overtake him who rejects it and turns away   
pharaoh said   who then is the lord of you both  moses  
moses replied   our lord is he who has given everything its form  then guided it  
pharaoh asked   what about the previous generations  
moses said   my lord alone has knowledge of that  recorded in a book my lord neither errs nor forgets  
it is he who has laid out the earth for you and traced routes in it and sent down water from the sky we have brought forth every sort of plant with it 
so eat and graze your cattle in this there are signs for men of understanding 
from the earth we have created you and we will return you to it  and from it we shall bring you forth a second time 
we showed pharaoh all our signs but he rejected them and refused to believe in them 
he said   have you come to us to turn us out of our land by means of your magic  moses 
we will certainly bring you magic to match it so appoint a time between us and you  in an open space  which neither we nor you will fail to keep  
moses said   the day of the encounter will be the day of the festival  and let the people assemble when the sun has risen high  
so pharaoh withdrew  devised his stratagem and returned 
moses said to them   woe to you  do not invent lies against god  lest he destroy you by some calamity  whoever invents lies is bound to fail  
then they the magicians conferred among themselves  whispering to one another 
they said   certainly they are both magicians who want to drive you out of your land by their magic  and destroy your best traditions 
therefore  decide upon your plan and then come forward in ranks whoever gains the upper hand today shall surely triumph  
they said   moses  will you throw down first  or shall we be the first to throw down  
moses said   you throw down first   suddenly their ropes and staffs appeared to him  by their magic  to be moving about rapidly 
and in his heart moses became apprehensive 
but we said   do not be afraid it is you who shall prevail  
throw down that staff which is in your right hand    it shall swallow up what they have wrought  for what they have wrought is only a magician s trick a magician shall never thrive  come whence he may 
the magicians then prostrated themselves they said   we believe in the lord of aaron and moses  
pharaoh said   have you believed in him before i permit you he must be your master who has taught you magic i will cut your hands and feet off on opposite sides  and have you crucified on the trunks of palm trees you shall know whose punishment is more severe and more lasting  
they said   never shall we prefer you to all the evidence of the truth that has come to us nor to him who has brought us into being so decide whatever you will your jurisdiction only covers the life of this world   
we have believed in our lord so that he may forgive us our sins and forgive us the sorcery that you have forced us to practice god is the best and the most abiding  
indeed  he who comes to his lord a sinner shall be consigned to hell  he shall neither die therein nor live 
but he who comes to him as a believer  having done good deeds  shall be exalted to the highest ranks 
he will abide forever in the gardens of eternity  through which rivers flow that is the recompense for those who purify themselves 
we sent a revelation to moses saying   take away my servants by night and strike for them a dry path through the sea have no fear of being overtaken and do not be afraid  
pharaoh pursued them with his hosts  but they were submerged by the sea  which was destined to overwhelm them 
for pharaoh had led his people astray and did not guide them 
children of israel  we delivered you from your enemies and we made a covenant with you on the right side of the mount we sent down manna and quails for you 
eat from the wholesome things with which we have provided you but do not transgress  lest you should incur my wrath we said    he that incurs my wrath shall surely be ruined 
but i am most forgiving towards him who turns in repentance and believes and acts righteously and follows the right path  
 when moses was upon the mount  god said   o moses  why have you come with such haste from your people  
he said   they are following in my footsteps  while i have hastened to you  my lord  to please you  
but god said   we have tested your people in your absence the samiri has led them astray  
moses returned to his people in anger and great sorrow he said   my people  did your lord not make you a handsome promise was my absence too long for you did you desire that your lord s wrath should descend upon you  when you broke your promise to me  
they answered   we did not break our promise to you of our own accord  but we had to carry loads of the people s ornaments and so we threw them into the fire for that was what the samiri suggested  
then he forged a calf for them    an image producing a lowing sound they said   this is your deity  the deity of moses  he has forgotten it  
why did they not see that it could not give them any response and had no power to harm or benefit them 
aaron had already told them   o my people  you are only being tested by this your lord is the all merciful  so follow me and obey my command  
they replied   we shall not cease to worship it until moses returns to us  
moses said to aaron   what prevented you  when you saw that they had gone astray 
from following me why did you disobey my command  
aaron said   son of my mother  do not seize me by my beard nor by my head i was afraid that you would say  you have caused dissension among the children of israel and did not pay heed to my words  
moses said   what was the matter with you  samiri  
he said   i perceived what they did not see so i took a handful of dust from the footprint of the messenger and threw it in the calf that is what my inner self prompted me to do  
moses said   begone  it shall be your lot to say throughout your life   do not touch me   and you will be faced with a fate from which there will be no escape now look at your deity to which you have become so devoted  we shall burn it up  and then scatter it into the sea 
your only deity is god  there is no deity but him his knowledge encompasses all things  
thus we relate to you the history of past events  and we have given you a reminder the quran from us 
whoever turns away from it will bear a heavy burden on the day of judgement 
which they shall bear forever it will be a grievous burden for them on the day of judgement 
the day when the trumpet shall be blown  we shall gather all the sinners on that day their eyes will turn blue with terror
and they shall murmur to one another   you stayed only ten days on the earth    
we know best what they will say the most perceptive of them will say   you stayed only one day  
they ask you about the mountains say   my lord will scatter them as dust
and leave the earth level and bare 
with neither hollows nor upthrust mounds to be seen 
on that day all will follow the summoning voice from which there is no escape  and all voices will be hushed before the lord of mercy  and nothing will be heard except a subdued murmur 
on that day no intercession will avail  except from one who has received the sanction of the merciful and of whose words he approves 
he knows what is before them and what is behind them  but they cannot encompass him with their knowledge 
on that day all faces shall be humbled before the living  self subsisting one those burdened with evil deeds will come to grief 
but he who does good works  being a believer  shall fear no harm nor any injustice  
we have thus sent down the quran in arabic and given all kinds of warnings in it  so that they may fear god  or may take heed   
exalted is god  the true king do not be impatient with the quran before its revelation is completed  and say   my lord  increase my knowledge  
we made a covenant with adam before you  but he forgot  and we found him lacking in constancy 
when we said to the angels   prostrate yourselves before adam   they all prostrated themselves  except for satan  who refused 
we said   adam  satan is an enemy to you and to your wife let him not turn you both out of paradise and thus make you come to grief 
here you shall not go hungry or be naked 
you shall not thirst  nor feel the sun s heat  
but satan whispered evil to him  saying   adam  shall i lead you to the tree of immortality and to a kingdom that never declines  
they both ate the fruit of this tree  and so they became conscious of their nakedness and began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden thus adam disobeyed his lord and fell into error 
then his lord had mercy on him  accepted his repentance and guided him 
god said   go down  both of you  from here  as enemies to one another   if there comes to you guidance from me  then whoever follows my guidance will not lose his way  nor will he come to grief 
but whoever turns away from my reminder  will lead a straitened existence and on the day of judgement we shall raise him up blind
and he will ask   lord  why have you raised me up blind  while i possessed sight before  
god will say   just as our signs came to you and you ignored them  so will you on this day be ignored  
thus we shall reward the transgressor who denies the signs of his lord but the suffering of the life to come is more terrible and more lasting 
do they not learn a lesson from our destruction of many generations before them in whose dwelling places they walk about surely in this are signs for men of understanding 
but for a pre ordained word from your lord  and a term of respite already fixed  immediate punishment would inevitably have taken place 
so be patient with anything they may say and glorify your lord with his praise before the rising of the sun and before its setting  and glorify him in the hours of the night and at the beginning and end of the day  so that you may find comfort 
do not regard with envy the worldly benefits we have given some of them  for with these we seek only to test them the provision of your lord is better and more lasting 
bid your people say their prayers  and be constant in their observance we demand nothing from you it is we who provide for you  and the best end is that of righteousness 
they say   why does he not bring us a sign from his lord   have they not been given sufficient proof in previous scriptures 
if we had destroyed them with a punishment before this  they would have surely said   our lord  why did you not send to us a messenger so that we might have followed your commandment before we were humiliated and disgraced  
say   everyone is waiting  so wait if you will you shall know who has followed the right path  and who has found guidance  
the time of reckoning has drawn near for mankind  yet they are heedless and turn away 
whenever any fresh admonition comes to them from their lord  they listen to it  but do not take it seriously 
their hearts are distracted and forgetful the wrongdoers confer together secretly  saying   is not this man a mortal like you will you succumb to magic with your eyes open  
say   my lord knows every word spoken in the heavens and on the earth he is all hearing  all knowing  
some say   these are his confused dreams   others say   he has invented it himself   and yet others say   he is a poet let him bring us a sign as previous messengers did  
before them  not one of the communities which we destroyed believed either will these believe 
the messengers we sent before you were but men whom we had sent revelations ask the people of the book if you do not know this   
we did not give them bodies that needed no food  nor were they to live forever 
then we fulfilled our promise to them and we saved them and those with them whom we pleased  and we destroyed those who exceeded all bounds 
we have revealed a book to you which is admonition for you will you not then understand 
how many communities of evil doers we have destroyed  raising up other people after them 
when they felt our punishment coming upon them  they began to flee from it 
they were told   do not try to flee  but return to the comfort and luxuries in which you exulted and to the places where you lived  so that you may be questioned  
they said   woe to us  we were indeed wrongdoers  
and this they kept repeating until we caused them to become like a field mowed down  and reduced to ashes 
it was not in play that we created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them 
had we wished to find a pastime  we would surely have found it in that which is with us  if such had been our will 
we will hurl the truth at falsehood  the falsehood shall be crushed and will disappear woe to you for what you utter 
to him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and on the earth and those that are with him are never too proud to worship him  nor do they grow weary 
they glorify him night and day without tiring 
have they taken deities from the earth who can bring the dead to life 
if there had been in the heavens and on the earth  other deities besides god  both the heavens and earth would be ruined god  lord of the throne  is far above that which they ascribe to him 
none shall question him about his works  but they shall be questioned 
have they taken other deities besides him say to them   bring your proofs this is the reminder of those who are with me and the reminder of those who were before me   but most of them do not know the truth  and so they turn away from it 
we sent all messengers before you with this revelation   there is no deity save me  so worship me alone  
they say   the all merciful has taken a son   glory be to him  they are only his honoured servants 
they do not try to speak ahead of him  and they act at his command 
he knows what is before them and what is behind them  and they cannot intercede without his permission indeed they themselves stand in awe of him 
whoever of them should say   i am a deity besides him   shall be requited with hell thus do we reward the wrongdoers 
do not those who deny the truth see that the heavens and the earth were joined together and that we then split them asunder and that we have made every living thing out of water will they still not believe 
we set firm mountains upon the earth lest it should sway under them  and we placed therein passages for paths so that they might find their way 
we have made the heaven a well secured canopy  yet still they turn away from our signs 
it is he who created the night and the day  and the sun and the moon  each gliding in its orbit 
we have not granted everlasting life to any human being before you  then if you muhammad should die  will they live forever 
every soul shall taste death  we test you with both good and evil circumstances as a trial to us you shall return 
when those who deny the truth see you  they laugh at you  saying   is this the one who talks of your deities   yet it is they who deny all mention of the gracious one 
man is a creature of haste soon i will show you my signs  but do not ask me to hasten them 
they ask   when will this promise be fulfilled  if what you say be true  
if only those who deny the truth knew the time when they would not be able to ward off the fire neither from their faces nor from their backs they will not be helped 
indeed  it will come upon them suddenly and confound them  and they will not be able to ward it off  nor shall they be reprieved 
other messengers have been mocked before you  but those who scoffed were overwhelmed by the very thing they had mocked 
say   who will save you from the wrath of the most gracious  by night and by day   yet they turn away from the remembrance of their lord 
do they have other deities who can defend them against us they cannot even help themselves  neither can they be aided against us 
yet we bestowed the good things of life upon their fathers for a great length of time but do they not see how we are shrinking their borders is it they who will prevail 
say   i warn you only through the revelation   but the deaf can hear nothing when they are warned 
yet if even a breath of your lord s punishment touched them  they would say   woe to us  we were indeed wrongdoers  
we shall set up scales of justice on the day of resurrection  so that no soul can be in the least wronged actions as small as a grain of mustard seed shall be weighed we are sufficient as a reckoner 
we gave moses and aaron the criterion of right and wrong and a light and reminder for the righteous 
those who fear their lord in the unseen  also dread the hour of judgement 
this is a blessed reminder that we have revealed to you will you then reject it 
before this we gave abraham his guidance we knew him well 
when he asked his father and his people   what are these images to which you are so devoted  
they replied   we found our fathers worshipping them  
abraham said   indeed  you and your fathers have been clearly misguided  
they said   have you brought us the truth or are you jesting  
abraham replied   your lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth  who created them  and i bear witness to that 
by the lord  i will devise a plan against your deities after you have gone away and turned your backs  
he broke them all into pieces  except for the biggest one of them  so that they might return to it for enquiry 
who has done this to our deities he must be a wrongdoer 
some said   we heard a young man  called abraham  talking about them  
they said   then bring him here in the sight of all the people  so that they may act as witnesses  
they said   abraham  was it you who did this to our deities  
he answered   rather this biggest one of them did it ask them  if they can speak  
then they turned to one another and said   it is you yourselves who are in the wrong  
then they hung their heads  and said   o abraham  you know they cannot speak  
abraham said   so  do you worship something instead of god that can neither benefit you nor harm you 
shame on you and on whatever you worship instead of god can you not understand  
they said   burn him and help your deities  if you are resolved to do something  
but we said   fire  be cool and a means of safety for abraham  
they had sought to do him harm  but we frustrated them 
and we saved him and lot and brought them to a land which we had blessed for all people 
we bestowed isaac and then jacob on him as an additional boon and we made all of them righteous 
we made them leaders who guided people by our command we revealed to them the doing of good  observance of prayer and the giving of alms and us alone did they worship 
to lot we gave wisdom and knowledge and delivered him from the city which practiced abomination they were indeed a wicked people 
we admitted him to our mercy  he was a righteous man 
before him noah cried out to us  and we heard his prayer we saved him and all his household from a great distress 
we helped him against his people who rejected our revelations they were surely a wicked people  so we drowned them all 
tell of david and solomon who both passed judgement on the field into which some people s sheep had strayed and grazed at night we bore witness to their judgement 
we gave solomon the right understanding of the matter  and we bestowed wisdom and knowledge on both of them we caused the mountains and the birds to celebrate our praises along with david we had the power to do this   
we taught him the art of making coats of mail for you  to protect you in battle will you then give thanks 
we subjected to solomon the stormy wind  which blew at his behest towards the land which we had blessed for it is we who have knowledge of all things   
we also subjected to him some of the jinn who dived for him in the sea and performed other tasks  we kept a watch over them 
remember job when he called on his lord saying   i have been afflicted with great distress  but you are the most merciful of the merciful  
we heard his prayer and relieved his suffering  we restored to him his family  doubling their number as an act of our grace  and as a reminder for the worshippers 
remember ishmael and idris and dhul kifl  they were all patient and steadfast 
we admitted them to our mercy they were all righteous men 
remember the man in the whale jonah when he went away in anger  thinking we had no power over him but he cried out in the darkness   there is no deity but you glory be to you  i was indeed wrong  
so we heard his prayer and delivered him from sorrow thus shall we deliver the true believers 
remember zachariah  when he called out to his lord   do not leave me heirless lord  you are the best of heirs  
so we heard his prayer and bestowed john upon him and made his wife fit to bear him a child they used to hasten to do good and they called on us in hope and fear  and they were always humble towards us 
remember the one who guarded her chastity  so we breathed our spirit into her  and made her and her son a sign for all people 
this community of yours is one community and i am your lord  so worship me 
but they divided themselves into factions  but to us they shall all return 
he who does good works while he is a believer  shall not see his efforts disregarded  we record them all 
it is ordained that no nation we have destroyed shall ever rise again 
but when gog and magog are let loose and swarm down from every hillside and they spread out  leaping across every barrier of land and sea  
when the true promise of god draws near  those who denied the truth will stare in amazement  crying   woe to us  we have been so heedless of this indeed  we were wrongdoers  
you and what you worship instead of god will be fuel for hell  to it you shall all come   
if those had really been deities  they would not have been led there  but there they will remain forever 
they shall groan they will not hear therein anything else 
but those who have been promised a good reward by us will be kept far away from hell   
they will not hear the slightest sound of it  and they shall forever abide in a state of bliss  among everything their souls longed for 
the great horror of the day of judgement shall not grieve them  and the angels will welcome them  saying   this is your day which you have been promised  
on that day we shall roll up the heavens like a scroll of parchment as we originated the first creation  so shall we repeat it this is a promise binding on us truly  we shall fulfill it 
we have already written in the psalms following the reminder   my righteous servants shall inherit the earth  
herein  surely is a message for true worshippers 
we have sent you forth as a mercy to all mankind 
say   it has been revealed to me that your god is but one god will you then submit to him  
if they turn away  say   i have warned you all alike  though i do not know whether the scourge which you are promised is near at hand or far off 
god surely knows what you say openly and also knows what you conceal 
nor do i know whether it may mean a trial for you and a short reprieve  
say   my lord  judge with truth our lord is the gracious one whose help we seek against what you utter  
o people  fear your lord the catastrophe of the last hour shall be terrible indeed 
when that day comes  every suckling mother shall forsake her infant and every pregnant woman shall cast her burden and everyone will appear intoxicated  although they are not  the punishment of god will be severe indeed 
yet there are some who dispute about god without having any knowledge and they follow every rebellious devil 
it has been decreed concerning anyone whom he befriends  that he shall mislead him and guide him to the punishment of the fire 
o people  if you are in doubt about the resurrection  remember that we first created you from dust  then from a sperm drop  then from clotted blood  then a lump of flesh  both shaped and unshaped  so that we might manifest to you our power we cause what we will to stay in the womb for an appointed time  then we bring you forth as infants and then we cause you to grow and reach full growth then  some of you will pass away early in life  while some of you will reach extreme old age in which they will know nothing of what they once knew you see the earth  dead and barren  but no sooner do we send down rain upon it than it begins to stir and swell  and produce every kind of luxuriant vegetation 
that is because god is the truth it is he who gives life to the dead and he has the power to will anything 
the last hour is bound to come there is no doubt about it god will raise up those who are in their graves 
there are some who dispute about god without having any knowledge or guidance  or any enlightening book 
they turn away arrogantly  leading people astray from god s path such men shall incur disgrace in this life and taste the punishment of the fire on the day of judgement 
 god will say   this is the reward of your misdeeds god is not unjust to his servants  
there are some who worship god half heartedly  then  if some good befalls them  they are content with it  but if an ordeal befalls them  they revert to their former ways they lose in this world as well in the hereafter that is a clear loss 
he calls on  instead of god  something that can neither harm him  nor benefit him that is indeed straying far away   
he calls on that which would sooner harm than help such a patron is indeed evil and such a companion is indeed evil 
god will admit those who believe and act righteously into gardens watered by flowing rivers god does whatever he wills 
anyone who thinks that god will not help him his messenger in this world and the hereafter  let him stretch a rope up to the sky  then let him cut it off and see if his plan can help to remove the cause of his anger 
we have sent down the quran as clear evidence  and surely god guides whom he will 
god will judge between the believers  the jews  the sabaeans  the christians  the magians and the polytheists on the day of judgement surely god is witness to everything 
do you not see that whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth  as well as the sun and the moon  and the stars and the mountains  and the trees and the beasts and many human beings    all submit to god but there are many who have become deserving of punishment whoever god disgraces  will have no one to honour him surely  god does what he wills 
these two groups  the believers and those who deny the truth   dispute concerning their lord those who deny the truth will have garments of fire cut out for them  and boiling water will be poured down over their heads 
anything in their stomachs as well as their skins will be melted by it 
there will be maces of iron for them 
whenever  in their anguish they seek to escape from hell  they will be driven back into it  and they will be told   taste the punishment of hell  
god will admit those who believe and do good deeds to gardens watered by flowing rivers  there they will be given bracelets of gold and pearls to wear and their clothing will be of silk 
for they were guided to purity of speech and they were guided to the path of the glorious lord 
as for those who deny the truth and debar others from god s path and from the sacred mosque which we set up for all people  natives and strangers alike  and all who seek to profane it by evil doing    we shall make them taste a painful punishment 
we assigned to abraham the site of the house  saying   do not associate with me anything and purify my house for those who circumambulate the kabah and those who stand upright  and those who bow and prostrate themselves  
call mankind to the pilgrimage they will come to you  on foot  and on every kind of lean camel  by every distant track
so that they may witness its benefit for them and  on the appointed days may utter the name of god over the cattle he has provided for them then eat their flesh  and feed the distressed and the needy   
then let the pilgrims purify themselves and fulfil their vows and perform the circumambulation of the ancient house 
such is god s commandment whoever honours that which is declared sacred by god may be sure that it counts for good in the sight of his lord livestock is lawful for you  except that which has already been explicitly forbidden then shun the abomination of the deities and shun all falsehood 
devote yourselves to god  not associating any partners with him whoever associates anything with god is like one who falls from heaven and is snatched by the birds or carried away by the wind to a distant place 
thus it is he who honours the symbols set up by god shows the piety of his heart 
you may benefit from the animals for an appointed time then they must be sacrificed at the ancient house 
for every people we have appointed rites of sacrifice  so that they may pronounce the name of god over the cattle which he has provided for them your god is one god  surrender yourselves to him  and give good news to the humble
whose hearts are filled with awe at the mention of god  who endure adversity with fortitude  say their prayers regularly and spend out of what we have given them 
we have appointed for you the sacrificial camels as one of the symbols set up by god  in which there is much good for you so invoke god s name over them as you line them up for slaughter  and when they have fallen down dead  feed yourselves and feed the needy    those who do not ask as well as those who do we have thus subjected them to you so that you may be grateful 
their flesh and blood do not reach god  it is your piety that reaches him thus god has subjected them to you  so that you may glorify him for the guidance he has given you give glad tidings to those who do good 
god will surely defend the believers god does not love the perfidious and the ungrateful 
permission to fight is granted to those who are attacked  because they have been wronged  god indeed has the power to help them 
they are those who have been driven out of their homes unjustly  only because they said   our lord is god   if god did not repel the aggression of some people by means of others  cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques  wherein the name of god is much invoked  would surely be destroyed god will surely help him who helps his cause    god is indeed powerful and mighty 
 they are those who  if we established them in the land  would say their prayers regularly and pay the zakat and enjoin good and forbid evil the final outcome of all affairs rests with god 
if your opponents deny you  remember that  before them  the people of noah and the tribes of ad and thamud denied their messengers likewise 
so did the people of abraham and the people of lot 
and the inhabitants of midian also charged their prophets with falsehood moses was also rejected i gave respite to those who denied the truth  but then i seized them consider then  how terrible my repudiation of them was 
how many a town we destroyed which was given to wrongdoing  so that its roofs fell down  and how many a well is deserted and how many a lofty castle is in ruins 
have these people not travelled through the land to make their hearts understand and let their ears hear  the truth is that it is not the eyes that are blind but the hearts that are in the bosoms that are blinded 
they ask you to hasten the punishment  god will never go back on his promise a day with your lord is like a thousand years in your reckoning 
to how many a town we gave respite while it was given to wrongdoing then i seized it to me all things shall return 
say   o people  i am sent only to give you clear warning  
those who believe and do good deeds shall be forgiven and shall receive an honourable provision 
whereas those who strive against our signs  seeking to defeat their purpose  shall be the inmates of the fire 
whenever we sent any messenger or prophet before you  and he recited anything of our revelation   satan tampered with it but god abrogates satan s interjections and then he firmly reaffirms his revelations god is all knowing and all wise 
he makes satan s suggestions a trial for those whose hearts are diseased or hardened  and  surely  the wrongdoers are far gone in error 
so that those who are given knowledge may realize that this is the truth from your lord and thus believe in it  and so that in their hearts they may humbly submit to him god will surely guide the faithful to a straight path 
those who deny the truth will continue in doubt until the last hour suddenly comes upon them or the scourge of the woeful day descends upon them 
on that day all control will belong to god he will judge between them those who believe and do good deeds shall enter the gardens of bliss 
but those who deny the truth and deny our signs will receive a humiliating punishment 
as for those who left their homes for the cause of god and then were slain or died  god will give them a generous provision surely god is the best of providers 
he will admit them to a place with which they shall be well pleased for god is all knowing and most forbearing 
thus it shall be as for one who retaliates to the same extent as he has suffered and then is again wronged  god will surely come to his aid god is merciful and forgiving 
that is because god makes the night pass into the day and makes the day pass into the night god is all hearing and all seeing 
that is because god is the truth while anything they invoke besides god is sheer falsehood god is the sublime  the great one 
have you not seen how god sends down water from sky  whereupon the earth becomes green god is unfathomable  and all aware 
all that is in the heavens and on the earth belongs to him surely  god is self sufficient and praiseworthy 
do you not see  how god has subjected everything on the earth to you  and the ships that sail on the sea by his command he holds back the sky from falling down on the earth  except with his permission god is most compassionate and most merciful to mankind   
it is he who gave you life then he will cause you to die then he will give you life again surely  man is most ungrateful 
we have appointed for every community ways of worship to observe let them not dispute with you on this matter call them to the path of your lord    for surely  you are rightly guided   
if they should dispute with you  then say   god is well aware of what you do  
on the day of resurrection  god will judge between you regarding your differences 
do you not know that god has knowledge of what the heavens and the earth contain all is recorded in a book  all this is easy for god 
yet instead of god  they worship something for which god has sent no authority and about which they have no knowledge the wrongdoers will have no helper 
whenever our clear revelations are recited to them  you will recognize the disgust on the faces of those who deny the truth it is almost as if they are going to attack those who recite our message to them say   shall i tell you of something worse than this it is the fire that god has promised to those who are bent on denying the truth what an evil destination  
people  here is an illustration so listen carefully surely  those whom you invoke other than god cannot create even a fly  even if they were all to combine together to do it  and if a fly should snatch anything away from them  they cannot recover it from it both are indeed weak  the seeker and the sought 
no just estimate have they made of god surely god is powerful and mighty 
god selects messengers from both angels and from mankind  god is all hearing and all seeing 
he knows what lies ahead of them and what is behind them all things shall return to god 
you who are true believers  kneel and prostrate yourselves  worship your lord and do good works  so that you may succeed 
strive for the cause of god as it behoves you to strive for it he has chosen you and laid on you no burden in the matter of your religion  the faith of abraham your forefather in this  as in former scriptures he has given you the name of muslims  so that the messenger may be a witness over you  and so that you may be witnesses over mankind therefore  say your prayers regularly and pay the zakat and hold fast to god he is your master an excellent master and an excellent helper 
successful indeed are the believers 
those who are humble in their prayer 
those who turn away from all that is frivolous 
those who pay the zakat 
those who safeguard their chastity
except with their wives  and what their right hands possess    for then they are free from blame 
but those who seek to go beyond that are transgressors   
those who are faithful to their trusts and promises 
and those who attend to their prayers 
these are the heirs of paradise
they shall abide in it forever 
we created man from an essence of clay 
then we placed him as a drop of fluid in a safe place 
then we developed that drop into a clinging form  and we developed that form into a lump of flesh  and we developed that lump into bones  and clothed the bones with flesh then we brought him into being as a new creation  glory be to god  the best of creators 
after this you shall surely die 
then you will be raised up again on the resurrection day 
we have created seven paths above you  we have never been unmindful of our creation 
we sent down water from the sky in due measure and lodged it in the earth  but if we please  we have the power to take it away 
we have produced palm groves and vineyards for you  in which there are abundant fruits for you  and you eat these 
also a tree growing on mount sinai which produces oil and a condiment for those who eat it 
you have a lesson in livestock we provide you with drink from what is in their bellies  and you have many other benefits from them  some of them you eat 
and you ride on them as you do in ships 
we sent noah to his people  and he said   my people  worship god  you have no other deity except him will you not fear him  
the leaders of his people who denied the truth  said   he is only a human being like yourselves who wants to make himself superior to you if god had wished  he would have sent down angels we never heard about this from our forefathers 
he is only a madman  so  as far as he is concerned wait for a while  
noah said   my lord  help me  for they have rejected me  
then we revealed our will to him   build the ark under our watchful eye according to our instructions when our command comes  and waters gush up out of the earth  take on board pairs of every species and members of your household  except for any of them on whom sentence has already been passed    do not plead with me for those who have done wrong  they shall be drowned 
when you and all your followers have settled in the ark  say   praise be to god who has delivered us from a wicked people  
and say  my lord  let me land with your blessing in a blessed landing place you alone can provide the best landings  
surely there are clear signs in that in this way we put people to the test 
then we raised another generation after them 
and sent a messenger to them from among themselves   worship god alone you have no deity other than him will you not then fear god  
but the leaders of his people who denied the truth and denied the meeting in the hereafter  because we had granted them ease and plenty in their worldly life  said   this is only a human being like yourselves  he eats what you eat  and drinks what you drink 
if you obey a human being just like yourselves  then you will surely be lost 
does he promise you that when you die and have become dust and bones  that you will be brought forth again 
what you are promised is indeed far fetched 
there exists only our present life  we die and we live but once   and shall never be raised up again 
he is only a man who has invented a lie about god  and we are not going to believe him  
the messenger said   my lord  help me  for they have rejected me  
god said   before long they will be filled with regret  
the blast justly struck them and we reduced them to rubble away with such wicked people 
then we raised up other generations after them 
no community can advance or postpone its appointed time 
then we sent our messengers in succession every time their messenger came to a people  they rejected him so we destroyed them one after the other  and let them become mere tales so away with the people who will not believe 
then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our signs and clear authority
to pharaoh and his courtiers  but they behaved insolently  for they were an arrogant people 
they said   are we to believe in two human beings like ourselves  while their people are subject to us  
so they rejected them both  and became those who were destroyed 
we gave moses the book so that they might be guided 
we made the son of mary and his mother a sign and gave them shelter on a peaceful hillside watered by a fresh spring 
messengers  eat what is wholesome and do good deeds  i am well aware of what you do 
your religion is but one religion    and i am your only lord  therefore  fear me 
yet they divided themselves into factions  each rejoicing in what they had 
so leave them in their bewilderment for a while 
do they imagine that the wealth and children we have provided
have no other purpose except to help them in acquiring material benefits no indeed but they do not understand 
those who tremble with fear of their lord 
and believe in his messages
and do not ascribe partners to him 
and those who give to others what has been bestowed upon them with their hearts trembling at the thought that they must return to their lord 
it is they who vie with one another in doing good works and shall be the foremost in doing so 
we charge no soul with more than it can bear we have a record which clearly shows the truth and they will not be wronged 
but their hearts are heedless of this moreover  there are other deeds besides this which they do 
but then when we seize the affluent among them  they will cry out for help 
do not cry out for help this day  for surely you shall not be helped by us 
my revelations were recited to you  but you turned your backs
in arrogance  as if you were abandoning a story teller 
have they not pondered over the word of god has something come to them that did not come to their forefathers 
or do they not recognize their messenger  and so deny him 
do they say he is possessed rather he has brought them the truth  but most of them are averse to the truth 
if truth had followed their whims and desires  heavens and earth and all that lives in them would have been brought to ruin rather we have brought them their reminder yet they keep avoiding their reminder 
or are you asking them for any reward but the reward of your lord is the best  for he is the best of providers 
and  most surely  you are calling them to a straight path 
but those who do not believe in the hereafter have indeed deviated from that path 
even if we showed them mercy and relieved them of their afflictions  they would still persist in their transgression  wandering blindly 
we seized them with the punishment  but they did not surrender to their lord  nor will they humble themselves
until we open before them a gate of harsh punishment and then they will be dumbfounded 
it is he who gave you ears  eyes and hearts  yet how seldom you are grateful 
he it is who has multiplied you on the earth and to him you shall all be gathered 
he is the one who gives life and causes death and he controls the alternation of night and day will you not then understand 
but they say the same as the ancients said 
when we have died and become dust and bones  will we be raised up again 
we and our forefathers were promised this before this is nothing but fables of the ancients  
say   to whom do the earth and all therein belong tell me  if you have any knowledge  
they will say   to god   say   so will you not pay heed 
say   who is the lord of the seven heavens  and of the glorious throne  
they will say   they belong to god   say   so do you not fear him  
say   in whose hands lies sovereignty over all things  protecting all  while none can seek protection against him tell me  if you have any knowledge  
they will say   all this belongs to god   say to them   how are you then deluded  
we have revealed to them the truth but they are certainly liars 
god has not taken to himself a son  nor is there any other deity besides him  otherwise  each god would have walked away with what he had created they would surely have tried to overcome one another glory be to god  above all that they ascribe to him 
knower of the unseen and the visible  he is exalted above all that which they associate with him 
pray   lord  if you would show me that the punishment of which they have been warned 
then do not place me  lord  with the wrongdoers  
we certainly have the power to show you what they have been warned about 
repel evil with what is best  we are well aware of the things they say 
and say   my lord  i seek refuge with you from the prompting of the devils 
i seek refuge with you  lord  lest they should come near me  
when death comes to any of them  he says   my lord  send me back
so that i may do good works in the world i have left behind   never  it is indeed but a meaningless word that he utters a barrier shall stand behind such people till the day they are raised up again 
when the trumpet is blown  on that day there will be no ties of relationship between them  neither will they ask about one another 
then those whose scales weigh heavy with good works will be successful 
but those whose scales weigh light will have ruined their souls  in hell will they abide 
the fire will scorch their faces and they will abide therein with their faces distorted 
were not my messages recited to you and did you not reject them 
they will answer   lord  misfortune overcame us and we became an erring people 
lord  deliver us from hell then  if we revert again  we shall definitely be wrongdoers  
god will say   stay there and do not speak to me 
among my servants  there were those who said   lord  we believe  so forgive us and have mercy on us you are the best one to show mercy  
but you made a laughing stock of them to the point where it made you forget my remembrance  and you went on laughing at them 
i have rewarded them this day for their steadfastness  and it is they who have triumphed  
he will ask   how many years did you stay on earth  
they will say   we stayed a day or part of a day ask those who have kept count  
he will say   you only stayed for a little while  if only you knew 
do you imagine that we created you without any purpose and that you would not be brought back to us 
then  exalted be god  the true king  there is no deity except him  the lord of the glorious throne 
he  who invokes another deity along with god  a deity of whose divinity he has no proof  will be brought to account by his lord certainly  those who deny the truth shall never prosper 
say   lord  forgive us and have mercy you are the best of those who show mercy  
this is a chapter which we have revealed and which we have made obligatory  we have sent down clear revelations in it  so that you may take heed 
flog the adulteress and the adulterer  each one of them  with a hundred lashes let no pity for them cause you to disobey god  if you truly believe in god and the last day  and let their punishment be witnessed by a number of believers 
the adulterer shall marry only an adulteress or a polytheist woman  and an adulteress shall marry only an adulterer or a polytheist man  such marriages are forbidden for believers 
those who defame chaste women  but cannot produce four witnesses  shall be given eighty lashes do not accept their testimony ever after  for they are transgressors 
save those who afterwards repent and make amends  for truly god is forgiving and merciful 
one who accuses his wife and has no witnesses except himself shall swear four times by god that his charge is true 
and the fifth time  that god s curse may be upon him if he is telling a lie 
the wife shall receive no punishment  if she bears witness four times in the name of god that her husband has lied
and  a fifth time that god s wrath will be upon her if he is telling the truth 
were it not for god s grace and his mercy upon you  you would have come to grief and god is wise  acceptor of repentance 
those who brought up that slander were a band from among you do not regard it as a misfortune  for it is good for you every one of them shall be held to account for the sin he has committed  and he who took the greater part in it shall have a terrible punishment 
when you heard of it  why did not the believing men and believing women think well of their own people  and say   this is a manifest slander  
why did they not produce four witnesses if they could not produce any witnesses  they were indeed liars in the sight of god 
had it not been for the grace of god and his mercy on you in this world and the hereafter  a terrible punishment would have afflicted you for your plunging headlong into slander 
when you were spreading it with your tongues and saying with your mouths things of which you had no knowledge  you considered it to be a trivial matter  but  in god s sight  it was very serious 
when you heard it  why did you not say   it is not right for us to speak of this god forbid  this is a monstrous slander  
god warns you never to repeat the like of it again  if you are true believers 
god explains the commandments to you god is all knowing and wise 
those who desire that indecencies should spread among the believers  will have a painful chastisement in this world and the hereafter god knows  and you do not know 
but for the grace of god and his mercy upon you  and were not god compassionate and merciful  you would have come to grief 
o you who believe  do not follow in the footsteps of satan  and whoever follows in the footsteps of satan should know that he enjoins only indecency and evil but for the grace of god and his mercy upon you  not one of you would ever be purified  but god purifies whom he pleases god is all hearing and all knowing 
let not those who are possessed of means and plenty among you resolve to withhold their bounty from their kindred and the needy and those who have migrated from their homes in the cause of god let them forgive and overlook do you not wish god to forgive you god is forgiving and merciful 
truly  those who accuse chaste  unwary  believing women are cursed in this world and the hereafter for them awaits a terrible chastisement 
on the day when their own tongues  hands and feet shall bear witness against them about what they did 
on that day god will justly requite them  and they will realize that god is the truth  that makes all things manifest 
corrupt women are for corrupt men  and corrupt men are for corrupt women  good women are for good men and good men are for good women the latter are absolved from anything they may say  forgiveness and an honourable provision await them 
believers  do not enter other people s houses until you have asked their owners permission and greeted them that will be the better for you  so that you may be heedful 
if you find no one at home  do not go in until permission has been granted you if you are told to go away  then go away that is more proper for you god knows well what you do 
there is nothing wrong in your entering uninhabited houses if that serves a useful purpose  god knows all that you do openly  and all that you would conceal 
tell believing men to lower their gaze and remain chaste that is purer for them god is aware of what they do 
say to believing women that they should lower their gaze and remain chaste and not to reveal their adornments    save what is normally apparent thereof  and they should fold their shawls over their bosoms they can only reveal their adornments to their husbands or their fathers or their husbands fathers  or their sons or their husbands sons or their brothers or their brothers sons or their sisters sons or maidservants or those whom their right hands possess or their male attendants who have no sexual desire or children who still have no carnal knowledge of women nor should they swing their legs to draw attention to their hidden ornaments believers  turn to god  every one of you  so that you may prosper 
marry those among you who are single  and those of your male and female slaves who are fit for marriage if they are poor  god will provide for them from his bounty  for god s bounty is infinite and he is all knowing 
those who do not have the means to marry should keep themselves chaste until god grants them enough out of his bounty if any of your slaves desire a deed of freedom  write it out for them  if you find any promise in them  and give them some of the wealth god has given you do not force your slave maids into prostitution  in order to enrich yourself  when they wish to preserve their chastity yet if anyone forces them  once they have been forced  god will be forgiving and merciful to them 
we have sent down clear revelations to you and the example of those who passed away before you and an admonition for the god fearing 
god is the light of the heavens and the earth his light may be compared to a niche containing a lamp  the lamp inside a crystal of star like brilliance lit from a blessed olive tree  neither of the east nor of the west the luminous oil is as if ready to burn without even touching it light upon light  god guides to his light whom he will god draws such comparisons for mankind  god has full knowledge of everything 
 they worship in the houses which god has allowed to be raised for the remembrance of his name  morning and evening 
people who are not distracted by trade or commerce from the remembrance of god and the observance of prayer and the payment of the zakat    fearing a day when hearts and eyes will be convulsed 
so that god may reward them according to the best of their deeds and give them more out of his bounty god provides for whoever he wills without measure 
as for those who deny the truth  their works are like a mirage in a desert the thirsty traveller thinks it to be water  but when he comes near  he finds it to be nothing he finds god there  who pays him his account in full god is swift in his reckoning 
or like darkness on a deep ocean covered by waves billowing over waves and overcast with clouds  darkness upon darkness if he stretches out his hand  he can scarcely see it indeed  the man from whom god withholds his light shall find no light at all 
 prophet   do you not see that all those who are in the heavens and on earth praise god  as do the birds with wings outstretched each knows his own mode of prayer and glorification  god has full knowledge of all that they do 
to god belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth  and to god shall all things return 
do you not see how god drives the clouds  then joins them together  then piles them into layers and then you see the rain pour from their midst he sends down from the skies mountainous masses of clouds charged with hail  and he makes it fall on whom he will  and turns it away from whom he pleases the flash of his lightning may well nigh take away the sight 
god alternates the night and the day    truly  in this there is a lesson for men of insight 
god created every creature from water some crawl upon their bellies  others walk on two legs  and others walk on four god creates what he pleases he has power over all things 
we have sent down revelations clearly showing the truth god guides whom he wills to the straight path 
they say   we believe in god and in the messenger  and we obey   but then  even after that a group of them will turn away those are surely not believers
and when they are called to god and his messenger so that he may judge between them  some of them turn away 
but if the truth happens to be to their liking  they are quite willing to accept it 
is there a sickness in their hearts  or are they full of doubt or do they fear that god and his messenger will be unjust to them the truth is that they themselves are wrongdoers 
the response of the believers  when they are called to god and his messenger in order that he may judge between them  is only   we hear and we obey   it is they who will prosper 
those who obey god and his messenger  and fear god  and are mindful of their duty to him  are the ones who will triumph 
they swear firm oaths by god that if you command them to march forth  they will obey you say   do not swear  your obedience  not your oaths  will count god is well aware of all your actions  
obey god and obey the messenger if you turn away  then he is responsible for what he is charged with and you are responsible for what you are charged with if you obey him  you will be rightly guided the messenger is responsible only for delivering the message clearly 
god has promised to those among you who believe and do good works that he will surely grant them power in the land as he granted to those who were before them  and that he will surely establish for them their religion which he has chosen for them he will cause their state of fear to be replaced by a sense of security let them worship me and associate no other with me whoever still chooses to deny the truth is truly rebellious 
attend to your prayers and pay the zakat and obey the messenger  so that you may be shown mercy 
do not think that those who deny the truth can frustrate our plan on earth  their abode shall be hell  and it is indeed an evil resort 
believers  let even those whom you rightfully possess  and those who are under age ask your leave on three occasions when they come in to see you  before the morning prayer  when you have taken off your garments in the heat of noon  and after the evening prayer these are the three occasions for your privacy at other times  there is nothing blameworthy if you or they go around visiting one another thus god makes clear to you his revelations  god is all knowing and wise 
when your children have reached the age of puberty  let them still ask permission as their elders do thus god expounds to you his revelations  god is all knowing and wise 
there is no blame on elderly women who are past the age of marriage  if they take off their outer clothing  without revealing their adornments but it would be better for them to guard themselves god is all hearing  all knowing 
there is no harm if the blind  the lame  the sick or you yourselves eat in your own houses  or in the houses of your fathers  or mothers  or brothers  or sisters  or paternal uncles  or paternal aunts  or maternal uncles  or maternal aunts  or in those that you are in charge of or in the house of a friend there is no objection to your eating together or separately but when you enter houses  salute one another with a greeting of peace  a greeting from your lord full of blessings and purity thus does god expound to you his commandments  so that you may understand 
they only are true believers who believe in god and his messenger when they are with him on some matter of common concern  they should not depart until they have asked him for permission to do so those who ask you for such permission are the ones who truly believe in god and his messenger when they ask you for permission to attend to some affair of their own  then grant it to whoever you please and seek forgiveness from god for them god is forgiving and merciful 
do not treat being called by the messenger like being called by one another god knows those of you who slip away on some pretext let those who go against his order beware lest some affliction befall them or they receive a painful punishment 
surely  whatever is in the heavens and on the earth belongs to god god knows well what condition you are in on the day when they return to him  he will declare to them all that they have done god has full knowledge of all things 
blessed be he who has revealed the criterion the quran to his servant that he may warn the nations 
sovereign of the heavens and the earth  who has begotten no children and who has no partner in his sovereignty  it is he who has created all things and measured them out precisely 
yet they have taken  besides him  deities who create nothing and are themselves created  and who have no power to harm  or benefit themselves and who control neither death  nor life  nor resurrection 
those who deny the truth say   this is only a forgery of his own invention in which others have helped him   what they say is unjust and false 
they say   it is just fables of the ancients  which he has had written down they are dictated to him morning and evening  
say to them   it has been revealed by him who knows every secret that is in the heavens and on the earth truly  he is most forgiving and most merciful  
they say   what kind of a messenger is this who eats food and walks about in the market places why has no angel been sent down with him to warn us  
or a treasure should have been sent down to him  or he should have had a garden from which to eat   the wrongdoers say   you are surely following a man who is bewitched  
observe what kind of things they attribute to you they have surely gone astray and cannot find the right way again 
blessed is he who  if he please  can give you better things than that  gardens watered by flowing streams  and palaces too 
they deny the hour for those who deny that hour  we have prepared a blazing fire 
when it sees them from afar  they will hear its raging and roaring 
when they are thrown into a narrow space  chained together  they will plead for death 
but they will be told   do not call today for one death  call for many deaths  
say   which is better  this or the paradise of immortality which the righteous have been promised it is their recompense and their destination  
abiding there forever  they shall find in it all that they desire this is a binding promise which your lord has made 
on the day he gathers them all together with those they worship besides him  he will say   was it you who misled my servants  or did they stray away by themselves  
they will answer   hallowed be you  it was not proper for us to choose any guardian other than you but you gave them and their fathers the comforts of this life  so that they forgot your reminder and thus brought destruction upon themselves  
 god will say    now  they have given the lie to all your assertions  and you can neither ward off your punishment nor obtain any help   for  whoever of you has committed evil  shall be caused by us to taste great suffering  
we never sent any messengers before you who did not eat food and walk in the market place we make some of you a means of trial for others  to see whether you are steadfast your lord is all seeing 
those who do not expect a meeting with us say   why are angels not sent down to us   or  why do we not see our lord   surely  they are too proud of themselves and have greatly exceeded all bounds 
there will be no good tidings for the guilty on the day they see the angels  and they will cry out   keep away  keep away  
and we shall take all that they did and turn it into scattered dust 
the inhabitants of the garden will have the best residence and the finest lodging on that day 
on a day when the sky will split open with its clouds and the angels are sent down rank upon rank 
true sovereignty on that day will belong to the gracious one  and it will be a hard day for those who deny the truth 
on that day  the wrongdoer will bite his hands and say   would that i had walked in the messenger s path 
oh  would that i had never chosen such a one for my companion   
he made me forgetful of the warning after it had reached me satan is man s great betrayer  
the messenger will say   lord  my people did indeed discard the quran  
thus did we assign to every prophet an enemy from among the sinners  your lord is sufficient as a guide and a helper 
those who deny the truth say   why was the quran not sent down to him in a single revelation   we sent it in this manner  so that we might strengthen your heart we gave it to you in gradual revelation 
every time they raise an objection  we will bring you the truth and the best of explanations 
those who will be dragged headlong into hell shall have an evil place to dwell in  for they have strayed far from the right path 
we gave moses the book  and appointed his brother aaron as his supporter 
then we said   go together to the people who have denied our signs   we utterly destroyed them 
we drowned the people of noah also when they rejected their messengers and we made them an example to all mankind we have prepared a painful punishment for the wrongdoers 
to ad  and thamud  and the people of al rass  and as we did for the many a generation between them 
to each of them we gave warnings and each of them we destroyed completely 
indeed they must have come upon the town on which an evil rain had poured down did they not see it yet they have no faith in the resurrection 
whenever they see you they only make a mockery of you     is this the one god has sent as his messenger 
indeed  he would well nigh have led us astray from our deities  had we not been so steadfastly attached to them   when they behold the punishment  they shall realize who strayed furthest from the right path 
have you seen him who has taken his own desire to be his god can you be a guardian over him 
do you think most of them can hear or understand they are like cattle indeed  they are even more astray 
have you not seen how your lord lengthens the shadows had he pleased  he could have made them constant  then we placed the sun as an indicator for them 
then we withdrew it to us  a gradual withdrawal 
it is he who made the night a mantle for you  and sleep for repose  and made the day a time for rising 
it is he who sends the winds as heralds of his mercy and we send down pure water from the sky 
so that we may bring life to a dead land  and slake the thirst of our creation  cattle and men  in great numbers 
we have explained it to them in diverse ways  so that they may take heed  but most persist in their ingratitude 
if we had so wished  we might have sent a warner into every town 
so do not yield to those who deny the truth  but strive with the utmost strenuousness by means of this quran  to convey its message to them 
it is he who released the two bodies of flowing water  one sweet and fresh and the other salty and bitter  and set up an insurmountable barrier between them 
it is he who has created human beings from water and he has granted them the ties of blood as well as marriage your lord is all powerful 
yet they worship besides god that which can neither benefit them nor harm them one who denies the truth is a helper of evil against his lord 
we have sent you only as a bearer of glad tidings and as a warner 
say   i do not ask you for any recompense for this except that anyone who so wishes should take the right path to his lord  
put your trust in the one who is the ever living god   who never dies  and glorify him with his praise he is fully aware of the sins of his servants 
it is he who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days periods   then settled himself on the throne    the gracious one ask any informed person about him 
when they are told   prostrate yourselves before the gracious one   they ask   who is this gracious one shall we prostrate ourselves before whatever you will   this increases their aversion 
exalted is he who put constellations in the heavens  a radiant lamp and an illuminating moon   
it is he who has made night and day succeed each other  a sign for those who would take heed and would be grateful 
the true servants of the gracious one are those who walk upon the earth with humility and when they are addressed by the ignorant ones  their response is   peace  
and those who spend the night prostrating themselves  and standing before their lord 
who say   our lord  ward off from us the punishment of hell  for its punishment is a dreadful torment to suffer 
indeed  it is an evil abode and evil dwelling place  
they are those who are neither extravagant nor niggardly  but keep a balance between the two 
those who never invoke any other deity besides god  nor take a life which god has made sacred  except with the right to do so  nor commit adultery anyone who does that shall face punishment 
he shall have his suffering doubled on the day of resurrection and he will abide forever in disgrace 
except for those who repent and believe and do good deeds god will change the evil deeds of such people into good ones  he is most forgiving and most merciful 
he who repents and does good deeds has truly turned to god 
and those who do not bear false witness  and when they pass by frivolity  they pass by with dignity 
who do not turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to the signs of their lord when they are reminded of them 
who say   lord  grant us joy in our wives and children and make us a model for the righteous  
these are the ones who will be rewarded with lofty mansions in paradise  for their steadfastness they will be received therein with greetings of welcome and salutations of peace 
there they shall abide forever  a blessed dwelling and a blessed resting place 
say   what would my lord care for you  if you do not call on him because you have indeed rejected the truth and his punishment is bound to overtake you 
ta sin mim 
these are the verses of the book that makes things clear 
it may be that you will destroy yourself with grief because they will not believe 
but if we had so willed  we could have sent down to them a sign from the heavens so that their heads would be bowed down before it in utter humility 
whenever there comes to them any fresh warning from the merciful  they always turn their backs on it 
they have indeed rejected the message but the truth of what they laughed to scorn will dawn upon them before long 
do they not see the earth  and what beneficial kinds of things we have caused to grow in it 
surely in this there is a sign  yet most of them would not believe 
truly  your lord is the mighty one  the merciful 
when your lord called out to moses  saying   go to the wrongdoing people 
the people of pharaoh  will they not fear god 
moses replied   my lord  i fear they will reject me 
and  my breast is straitened and my tongue is not fluent  so send aaron as well 
besides  they accuse me of a crime  and i fear that they may put me to death  
god said   indeed not  go both of you with our signs  we shall be with you  listening to your call 
go to pharaoh  both of you  and say  we are messengers from the lord of the worlds 
let the children of israel go with us   
pharaoh said to moses   did we not bring you up among us as a child and you spent several years of your life with us 
yet you committed the deed you did  surely you are one of the ingrates  
moses replied   i did that when i was one of the misguided 
and i fled from you because i feared you then my lord granted me wisdom and made me one of the messengers 
and this is the favour with which you taunt me    that you have enslaved the children of israel  
pharaoh said   what is this  lord of the universe  
moses said   lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them  if only you would be convinced  
pharaoh said to those around him   did you hear  
moses went on   he is your lord and the lord of your forefathers  
pharaoh said   this messenger who has been sent to you is surely possessed  
moses said   he is the lord of the east and the west  and all that lies between them  if only you could understand  
pharaoh said   if you take any deity other than myself  i will throw you into prison  
and moses asked   even if i show you a clear sign  
pharaoh said   show it then  if you are telling the truth  
so moses threw down his staff and suddenly it appeared as a serpent  plainly visible 
and he drew out his hand  and it appeared shining white to the beholders 
pharaoh said to the chiefs around him   surely this man is a skilful sorcerer 
who wants to drive you out of your land by his sorcery now what do you advise  
they said   let him and his brother wait a while  and send heralds into the cities 
who shall bring to you every skilful sorcerer  
so the sorcerers were gathered on the appointed day
and the people were told   will you also gather together 
so that we may follow the magicians  if they be the winners  
when the magicians came  they asked pharaoh   shall we have a reward  if we are the winners  
he replied   certainly  in that case you will join my inner circle  
moses said to the magicians   throw down whatever you are going to throw  
so they cast down their ropes and staffs  and said   by pharaoh s honour  we shall surely win  
then moses threw down his staff  and it swallowed up all that they had conjured into being 
the magicians fell down prostrate 
saying   we believe in the lord of the worlds 
the lord of moses and aaron  
pharaoh said   have you come to believe in him  before i have given you permission he is surely your master who has taught you magic but you shall see i will cut off your hands and feet on alternate sides and crucify you all  
they said   there is no harm to our lord we shall return 
we hope our lord will forgive us  as we are the first of the believers  
then we revealed our will to moses  saying   set forth with my servants  in the night  for you will surely be pursued  
and pharaoh sent forth heralds to all the cities 
these  they said   are only a small band 
and they have enraged us 
we are a large and watchful force  
so we made them leave their gardens and springs 
their treasures and their noble dwellings   
and we made the children of israel inheritors of these bounties 
pharaoh and his people pursued them at sunrise 
and when the two groups saw each other  moses companions said   we are sure to be overtaken  
moses replied   no  my lord is with me  and he will guide me  
then we bade moses strike the sea with his staff and it parted  and each part was like a huge mountain 
in the meantime we made the others approach that place 
we delivered moses and all those who were with him 
then we drowned the others 
surely in that there is a sign  yet most of them do not believe 
truly  your lord is the mighty one  the merciful 
tell them the story of abraham 
when he asked his father and his people   what is that which you worship  
they said   we worship idols and will continue to cling to them  
he asked   do they hear you when you call to them 
do they help or harm you  
they replied   but we found our fathers doing the same  
abraham said   have you really thought about what you have been worshipping 
you and your forefathers   
they are all my enemies  not so the lord of the universe 
who created me it is he who guides me 
he who gives me food and drink 
he who cures me when i am ill 
he who will cause me to die and bring me back to life 
and he who will  i hope  forgive me my faults on the day of the judgement 
my lord  bestow wisdom upon me  unite me with the righteous 
give me a good name among later generations 
and make me one of the inheritors of the garden of bliss 
and forgive my father  for he is one of the misguided 
and do not disgrace me on the day when all people are resurrected 
the day when wealth and sons will be of no avail 
and when he alone will be saved who comes to god with a sound heart  
when paradise shall be brought near to the god fearing
and hell shall be revealed to the misguided 
they will be asked   where are those whom you worshipped
besides god can they help you or even help themselves  
then they will be thrown headlong into hell  both they and the misguided ones 
and satan s legions  all together 
they will dispute between themselves therein  and will say 
we were clearly misguided
when we made you equal with the lord of the universe 
it was the evildoers who led us astray 
and we have no intercessors now 
and no sincere friend 
if we could only return to the world and be among the believers  
there is certainly a sign in that  but most of them would not believe 
surely  your lord is the mighty one  the merciful 
the people of noah also rejected the messengers 
when their brother noah said to them   will you have no fear of god 
i am a trustworthy messenger for you 
fear god  and obey me 
i ask of you no recompense for it  for my only reward is with the lord of the universe 
so fear god and obey me  
they replied   are we to believe in you when your followers are but the lowest of the low  
he said   what knowledge do i have of their doings 
my lord alone can bring them to account  if only you could understand 
i am not going to drive away any believers 
i am only a plain warner  
they said   noah  if you do not desist  you will be stoned  
noah said   my lord  my people have rejected me 
therefore  judge decisively between me and them  and save me and the believers who are with me  
so we saved him  and those who were with him in the laden ark 
and drowned the rest 
there is certainly a sign in that  but most of them do not believe 
surely your lord is the mighty one  the merciful 
the people of ad  too  rejected the messengers 
their brother hud said to them   will you not fear god 
i am a trustworthy messenger for you 
fear god  then  and obey me 
i ask no recompense of you  my reward is only with the lord of the universe 
do you build monuments on every high place in vanity 
and erect castles hoping that you will live forever 
when you lay hands upon anyone  you do so as tyrants 
so fear god  and obey me 
fear him who has aided you with all that you know   
he has bestowed on you cattle  and sons 
and gardens  and springs   
indeed  i fear for you the torment of an awful day  
they replied   it makes no difference to us whether you preach or do not preach 
this is nothing but a habit of the ancients 
and we shall not be punished  
so they rejected him  and we destroyed them there is certainly a sign in that  but most of them would not believe 
surely your lord is the mighty one  the merciful 
the tribe of thamud also rejected the messengers 
when their brother salih said to them   will you not fear god 
truly  i am a trustworthy messenger for you 
so fear god and obey me 
for this i demand no recompense from you  my reward is only with the lord of the universe 
do you think that you will be left secure forever   
in the midst of gardens and fountains 
and cornfields  and palm trees laden with fruit   
hewing out houses in the mountains and taking pride in your skill 
so fear god and obey me 
do not obey the bidding of those who are given to excesses 
those who spread corruption in the land instead of putting things right  
they replied   surely you are bewitched 
you are only a human being like ourselves show us a sign  if you are telling the truth  
he said   here is a she camel she shall have her turn of drinking  as you have yours  each on an appointed day 
so do her no harm  or the punishment of an awful day will befall you  
yet they hamstrung her  and then they became regretful 
so the punishment came down upon them surely in that there is a sign  but most of them would not believe 
your lord is the mighty one  the merciful 
then the people of lot rejected the messengers 
when their brother lot said to them   will you not fear god 
i am a trustworthy messenger to you 
so fear god and obey me 
i ask of you no recompense for this  my reward is only with the lord of the universe 
do you  of all people  approach males 
and leave your wives whom your lord has created for you you are a people who transgress all bounds  
they said   if you do not desist  lot  you will surely be banished  
he said   i am one of those who abhors your ways 
my lord  save me and my family from their evil doings  
we saved him and all of his family 
except for an old woman who stayed behind 
then we totally destroyed the rest 
and we poured a rain of destruction down upon them    and how evil was the rain which fell on those who were forewarned 
surely in this there is a sign  but most of them would not believe 
your lord is the mighty one  the merciful 
the dwellers of the forest also rejected the messengers 
shu ayb said to them   will you not fear god 
i am a trustworthy messenger to you 
so fear god  and obey me 
i ask of you no recompense for this  my reward is only with the lord of the universe 
give full measure  and cause no loss to others 
weigh with correct scales 
do not defraud people of what is rightfully theirs  and do not spread corruption in the land 
fear him who created you and those who have gone before you  
they replied   you are bewitched 
you are only a human being like ourselves indeed we think you are a liar 
so cause a fragment of the sky to fall on us  if you are truthful  
he said   my lord has full knowledge of all your actions  
they rejected him  and then had to suffer the punishment of a day of overshadowing gloom that was indeed the punishment of an awful day 
surely  in this is indeed a sign  but most of them would not believe 
your lord is the mighty one  the merciful 
this surely is a revelation from the lord of the universe 
the faithful spirit has brought it down
into your heart  so that you may be a warner 
in clear arabic speech 
surely  it is foretold in the ancient scriptures 
is it not evidence enough for them that the learned among the children of israel have recognized this as true 
had we revealed it to any one of the non arabs 
and he had recited it to them  they would not have believed in it 
we have thus caused denial of truth to enter into the hearts of the sinners 
they will not believe in it until they see the grievous punishment 
it will come upon them suddenly when they are not expecting it 
then they will exclaim   could we have some respite  
do they want to hasten our punishment 
think  if we let them enjoy life for some years 
and then the promised punishment fell upon them 
of what avail would their past enjoyment be to them 
never have we destroyed a town without sending down messengers to warn it 
as a reminder from us  we are never unjust 
it was not the devils who brought down the quran 
neither are they worthy of it  nor are they capable of it 
indeed they are debarred from overhearing it 
so do not call on any deity besides god  lest you incur his punishment 
warn your nearest kinsmen 
and extend kindness and affection to those of the believers who follow you 
if they disobey you  say   i bear no responsibility for what you do  
put your trust in the mighty one  the merciful 
who sees you when you stand up for prayer  
and sees your movements among those who prostrate themselves 
he is the all hearing  the all knowing 
shall i tell you upon whom the devils descend 
they descend on every lying sinner 
who lends an ear to them  and most of them are liars 
and as for the poets    it is the misled who follow them 
do you not see how they wander aimlessly in every valley 
preaching what they do not practice 
not so the true believers who do good works and remember god with fervour and defend themselves only after they are wronged the wrongdoers will soon know how evil a turn their affairs will take 
ta sin these are verses from the quran  a book that makes things clear 
it is guidance and good news for the believers
who pray regularly and pay obligatory alms and have firm faith in the hereafter 
we have made those who do not believe in the hereafter feel their actions appear good to them  so they wander blindly 
they are the ones who will have the worst of punishment  and in the hereafter they will be the greatest losers 
you have received this quran from one who is all wise  all knowing 
tell of moses who said to his family   i have seen a fire i will bring you news from there  or a burning brand for you to warm yourselves  
when he came up to it  a voice called out   blessed be whoever is near this fire  and whoever is around it  glory be to god  lord of the universe 
o moses  i am god  the powerful  the wise 
throw down your staff   but when he saw it moving like a snake  he turned and fled  moses  do not be afraid  the messengers need have no fear in my presence 
as for those who do wrong and then do good after evil  i am most forgiving  most merciful 
now put your hand inside your cloak next to your bosom and it will come out shining white  without any blemish this will be one of the nine signs for pharaoh and his people  for truly they are a rebellious people  
but when our signs came to them in all their clarity they said   this is clearly sorcery  
and they persisted in rejecting them wrongfully and arrogantly  while in their hearts they were convinced of their truth observe  then  how evil was the fate of the evil doers 
we bestowed knowledge on david and solomon and they both said   praise be to god who has exalted us above many of his believing servants  
solomon succeeded david he said   know  my people  that we have been taught the speech of birds and endowed with all good things surely this is god s manifest grace  
solomon s hosts of jinn and men and birds  were all gathered together in his presence and were ranged in battle order 
and when they came to the valley of the ants  one ant said   ants  go into your dwellings  in case solomon and his hosts inadvertently crush you  
solomon smiled broadly at its words and said   lord  inspire me to be thankful for the blessings you have granted me and my parents  and to do good deeds that please you  and include me  by your grace  among your righteous servants  
then solomon inspected the birds  and said   how is it that i do not see the hoopoe is he absent then 
i shall surely punish him severely or order him to be executed  unless he gives me a good reason for his absence  
but he was not long in coming  and said   i have learnt something you did not know i have come to you from sheba with reliable news 
i found a woman ruling over them  who has been given everything and she has a mighty throne 
i found her and her people worshipping the sun  instead of god satan has made their conduct appear good to them  and has thus diverted them from the right path  so that they might not be guided 
should they not worship god who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and earth and knows both what you conceal and what you make known 
he is god  there is no deity but he  the lord of the mighty throne  
solomon said   we shall soon see whether you have spoken the truth  or whether you are a liar 
go with this letter of mine and lay it before them  then withdraw from them and see how they respond  
the queen of sheba said   o counsellors  an honourable letter has been delivered to me 
it is from solomon it reads   in the name of god  most gracious  most merciful 
do not exalt yourselves above me  but come to me in all submission  
now advise me in this  counsellors i never decide any affair till i have conferred with you  
they said   we are strong and our prowess in battle is great  but the decision is in your hands  so consider what you will command  
she said   surely  when mighty kings invade a country  they despoil it and humiliate its noblest inhabitants  these men will do the same 
but i shall send them a present and see with what reply my envoys will return  
so when the envoy came to solomon he said   what  are you offering me wealth but that which god has given me is better than that which he has given you yet you rejoice in your gift 
go back to them  we shall most certainly come upon them with forces which they will never be able to withstand  and shall most certainly cause them to be driven from their lands  disgraced and humbled  
solomon then said   o counsellors  which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission 
a demon from among the jinn said   i will bring it to you before you get up from your seat i am strong and trustworthy enough to do it  
but one of them who had some knowledge of the book said   i will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye   when solomon saw it placed before him  he exclaimed   this is by the grace of my lord  to test whether i am grateful or ungrateful whosoever is grateful  it is for the good of his own self  and whosoever is ungrateful  then surely my lord is self sufficient and generous  
he said   disguise her throne we shall see whether or not she will recognize it  
when she came to solomon  she was asked   is your throne like this   she replied   it looks as though it were the same  and we had been given knowledge of your power before this  and we have already submitted  
and that which she used to worship beside god had stopped her from believing   for she came of a disbelieving people 
then she was bidden to enter the palace  but when she saw it  she thought it was a deep pool of water  and bared her legs but solomon explained   it is just a palace paved with glass   and she said   my lord  i have wronged myself  now i submit myself along with solomon  to god  the lord of the universe  
to thamud we sent their brother salih he said   serve none but god   but they divided themselves into two factions contending with one another 
he urged them   o my people  why do you wish to hasten on the evil rather than the good why do you not ask forgiveness of god  so that you may be shown mercy  
they said   we see you and your followers as an evil omen   he replied   no  your evil omen is with god  the truth is that you are a people being put to the test  
there were in the city nine men who spread corruption in the land  and would not reform 
they said   let us bind ourselves by an oath sworn in the name of god that we shall attack salih and his family by night  and to his protector who demands retribution   we shall say   we were not present when they were slain we are telling the truth  
thus they devised a plan  and we also devised a plan  but they were not aware of it 
see  then  what the consequences of their plan were we destroyed them and their people utterly  all together 
because of their wrongdoing  their houses are in ruins  in that surely there is a sign for people who have knowledge 
and we saved those who believed in and feared god 
and tell of lot he said to his people   will you commit evil knowingly 
must you go lustfully to men instead of women indeed  you are a people who are deeply ignorant  
the only answer of his people was   drive out lot and his family from the city they are a people who make themselves out to be pure  
so we delivered him and his family  except his wife  we ordained her to be one of those who stayed behind 
and we pelted them with torrential rain how dreadful that rain was for those who had been warned 
say   all praise be to god  and peace be upon those servants of his whom he has chosen is god better  or what they associate with him 
who created the heavens and the earth and sends down water for you from the sky  by which we make luxuriant gardens grow  you could never make such trees grow in them  is it another deity besides god no indeed  but they are a people who equate others with him 
who is it that made the earth a stable place to live in who made rivers flow through it who set mountains upon it and placed a barrier between the two seas is there another deity besides god indeed  most of them have no knowledge 
who responds to the oppressed when he calls out to him  and relieves his suffering and who will make you inheritors of the earth then  is there a god besides god how little you pay heed 
who guides you in the darkness of the land and sea who sends the breezes as heralds of his mercy then  is there a deity besides god exalted is god above what they associate with him 
who originates creation  then regenerates it  and who gives you sustenance from heaven and earth then  is there a deity besides god   say   bring forward your proofs  if you are telling the truth  
say   no one in the heavens and the earth has knowledge of the unseen except god   they do not know when they will be raised up again 
indeed  their knowledge of the life to come stops short of the truth  they are often in doubt as to its reality  in fact  they are blind to it 
those who deny the truth say   when we have turned to dust like our fathers  shall we be brought back to life again 
we and our fathers were promised this before  these are but old stories  
say   roam across the earth and observe what was the end of the sinful ones  
do not grieve over them  nor feel distressed at their schemes 
they ask   when will this promise be fulfilled  if what you say be true  
say   it may be that a part of what you would hasten on is close behind you  
truly  your lord is bountiful to mankind  but most of them are not grateful 
the lord knows full well what they conceal in their hearts and what they disclose 
there is nothing hidden in heaven and on earth  but is recorded in a clear book 
this quran explains to the children of israel much of what they differ over 
certainly it is guidance and a blessing for the believers 
certainly your lord will decide between them in his wisdom  he is the almighty  the all knowing 
so put your trust in god surely you are on the path of manifest truth 
you cannot make the dead hear  nor can you make the deaf hear your call  when they turn their backs on it 
nor can you guide the blind out of their error you can make only those hear you who believe in our revelations and surrender themselves to us 
when god s word is justly carried out against them  we will produce a dabbah from the earth which will tell them that mankind had no real faith in our signs 
on that day we shall assemble together a host from every community of those who cried lies to our revelations and they will be grouped
then  when they have arrived  he will say   did you deny my revelations  even though you did not have proper knowledge of them or what was it that you were doing  
the verdict will be given against them  because they did wrong  and they will be speechless 
do they not see that we have made the night for them to rest in and the day to give them light there are certainly signs in that for people who believe 
on the day when the trumpet is blown  whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will be struck with terror  except for those whom god wishes to spare all shall come to him in utter humility 
you see the mountains and think them firmly fixed but they shall pass away as the clouds pass away such is the work of god  who has ordered all things to perfection  he is fully aware of what you do 
whoever does a good deed  shall be rewarded with what is better  and will be secure from fear of that day 
and those who do evil will be flung down on their faces in the fire are you not rewarded according to your deeds 
say   i am commanded to serve the lord of this town  which he has made inviolable and to whom everything belongs  i am commanded to be one of those devoted to him 
to recite the quran   whoever follows its guidance  follows it only for the good of his own soul  and as for him who goes astray  just say   i am only a warner  
then say   praise be to god  he will show you his signs and you will recognize them your lord is not unaware of what you do  
ta sin mim 
these are verses from the book that makes things clear 
we shall narrate to you some of the story of moses and pharaoh  with truth  for people who would believe 
pharaoh behaved arrogantly in the land  and divided the people into groups  seeking to weaken one section  slaying their sons and sparing their daughters  he was one of those who spread corruption 
we wished to favour those who were oppressed in the land  and to make them leaders and make them inheritors of our bounties  
and to give them power in the land  and to show pharaoh and haman and their hosts that very thing which they feared 
we inspired moses mother saying   suckle him  and then  when you fear for him  cast him into the river  and have no fear and do not grieve  for we shall return him to you  and shall make him one of the messengers  
then pharaoh s household picked him up    later to become for them an enemy and a source of grief for them  pharaoh and haman and their hosts were wrongdoers   
and pharaoh s wife said   he will be a joy to the eye for me and you  do not slay him  he may well be of use to us  or we may adopt him as a son   they did not realize what they were doing 
moses mother s heart was full of anxiety    she would have disclosed his identity had we not strengthened her heart so that she might be a firm believer in our promise 
she said to moses sister   go  and follow him   so she watched him from a distance  like a stranger  without anyone noticing her 
we had already made him refuse all wet nurses so his sister said to them   shall i tell you of a family who will bring him up for you and take good care of him  
thus we restored him to his mother  so that she might be comforted and not grieve any more  and so that she would know that god s promise was true but most of them do not realize this 
when moses reached full manhood and maturity  we bestowed upon him wisdom and knowledge  this is how we reward those who do good 
he entered the city unnoticed by its people  and there he encountered two men fighting with one another    one of his own people and the other one of his enemies the one who belonged to his own people cried out to him for help against his foe    whereupon moses struck him down with his fist  thereby causing his death moses said   this is satan s doing  he is an open foe  leading man astray  
he prayed   forgive me lord  for i have sinned against my soul   god forgave him  for he is the forgiving one  the merciful 
he said   my lord  because of the favour that you have shown me  i vow that i will never be a helper of the guilty  
the next morning  when he was walking in the city  apprehensive  and watchful  and the man who had sought his help the day before cried out to him again for help moses said to him   you are clearly a misguided man  
when he wanted to catch the one who was an enemy to them both  the man said   moses  do you want to kill me just as you killed a man yesterday you only want to become a tyrant in the land  you do not want to set things right  
a man came running from the far side of the city  and said   moses  the authorities are conspiring to kill you  so leave the city i am one of your well wishers  
so moses departed from the city  fearful and vigilant  and prayed   my lord  save me from these unjust people  
when he made his way towards midian  he said   i am sure  my lord will guide me to the right way  
and when he arrived at the well of midian  he found around it a group of men watering their flocks  and he saw two women standing apart from them  who were holding back their flocks  so he asked   what is the matter with you   they replied   we cannot draw water until the shepherds take away their sheep our father is a very old man  
so moses watered their flocks for them  and returned into the shade and prayed   lord  i am truly in need of whatever blessing you may send down for me  
and then one of the two women came walking shyly up to him and said   my father is asking you to come so that he may reward you for watering our flocks for us   when moses came to their father and gave him an account of himself  he said   don t be afraid  you have escaped from those wrongdoing people  
one of the girls said   father  hire him  for the best man to hire is someone strong and trustworthy  
the father said   i would like to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine on the condition that you stay eight years in my service but if you wish it  you may stay ten i do not want to impose any hardship on you god willing  you will find me a fair person  
moses said   that is agreed between me and you  whichever of the two terms i fulfil  there will be no blame on me god is witness to what we say  
when moses completed the term and set out with his family  he noticed a fire in the direction of mount tur he said to his family   stay here  i can see a fire perhaps i can bring you news  or a burning brand from the fire with which you may warm yourself  
and when he came to it  he was called by a voice from a bush in a blessed spot  on the right side of the valley   o moses  i am god  lord of the universe 
throw down your staff   and when he saw it move as though it were a serpent  he turned his back and fled  and did not look back  o moses   said the voice   come forward and have no fear  you are quite safe 
put your hand into your bosom  it will come out shining white  without blemish  now draw your arm close to your body to calm your fears these are two credentials from your lord for pharaoh and his nobles surely  they are a rebellious people  
moses said   my lord  i have killed one of their people and fear that they may kill me 
my brother aaron is more eloquent than i am send him with me to support me and back me up for i fear that they will reject me  
god said   we shall strengthen your arm through your brother  we shall give you both power  so that they shall not be able to harm you set forth with our signs you  and those who follow you  will surely prevail  
when moses came to them with our clear signs  they said   this is nothing but contrived magic we never heard of this among our forefathers  
and moses replied   my lord knows best who comes with guidance from him and who will attain the heavenly abode in the hereafter the wrongdoers shall never prosper  
pharaoh said   o nobles  i know of no god for you other than myself so  haman  burn me bricks of clay  and build me a high tower  so that i may have a look at the god of moses  though i consider him to be one of the liars  
he and his hosts behaved arrogantly in the land without any justification  thinking that they would not be recalled to us 
so we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea consider the fate of the wrongdoers 
we had made them leaders  but they called people to the fire  and on the day of judgement they will not be helped 
we have caused a curse to follow them in this world and  on the day of judgement  they will be among the wretched 
after we had destroyed the earlier generations  we gave moses the book to give men insight  and as guidance and a blessing for people  so that they might take heed 
you were not present on the western side of the mount when we gave our command to moses  nor were you among the witnesses 
we brought into being many generations who lived long lives  nor did you live among the people of midian and recite our revelations to them  it is we who send messengers 
you were not on the side of the mount when we called out to moses  but we have sent you as a mercy from your lord  so that you may warn people to whom no warner has been sent before you  so that they may take heed 
and may not say  if an affliction should befall them on account of their misdeeds   lord  if only you had sent us a messenger  we might have followed your message and become believers  
but when the truth came to them from us  they said   why has he not been given the like of what moses was given   but did they not reject what moses was given before they said   both moses and muhammad are kinds of sorcery  each assisting the other   and they add   we reject both of them  
say to them   bring down from god a scripture that is a better guide than these two and i will follow it  if what you say be true  
if they do not respond to you  then know that they follow only their own desires who could be more astray than he who follows his own likes and dislikes with no guidance from god god does not guide the evil doers 
we have conveyed our word to them  in succession  so that they may give heed 
those to whom we gave the book before this believe in it the quran  
and  when it is recited to them  they say   we believe in it indeed it is the truth from our lord even before it came  we had submitted ourselves  
such people as these will receive a double reward  because they are steadfast and repel evil with good  and give alms out of what we have given them 
and when they hear vain talk  they turn away from it and say   we have our actions and you have yours we wish you peace we will have nothing to do with the ignorant  
you cannot guide whoever you please  it is god who guides whom he will he best knows those who would accept guidance 
they say   if we were to follow your guidance  we should be uprooted from our land   but have we not established for them a safe haven to which fruits of every kind are brought as a provision from ourself but most of them have no knowledge 
how many townships have we destroyed where the people had become arrogant on account of their affluence since then their dwelling places have scarcely been inhabited    we became their inheritors 
your lord would never destroy a people until he had sent messengers to their capital cities  reciting to them our revelations nor did we destroy a town unless their people became wrongdoers 
whatever you are given in this life is nothing but a temporary provision of this life and its glitter  what god has is better and more lasting will you not then understand 
can someone to whom we have made a gracious promise and who will see it fulfilled  be compared to someone we have allowed to enjoy a worldly life  awhile  and who will be brought up before god for his accounting on the day of resurrection 
on that day he will call to them  and say   where are those whom you claimed to be my partners  
and those on whom sentence has been passed  will say   our lord  these are the ones who led us astray we led them astray as we ourselves were led astray we now dissociate ourselves from them before you  it was not us that they worshipped  
then they will be told   call upon your partners   and they will call upon them  but will receive no answer they shall witness the punishment if only they had allowed themselves to be guided 
on that day god will call out to them  saying   what answer did you give to our messengers  
they will be left speechless on that day  and they will not be able to consult each other 
but as for him who repents and believes and does good deeds  he can hope to find himself among the successful 
your lord creates whatsoever he wills and chooses whomsoever he pleases they have no choice praise be to god    exalted is he over anything they may associate with him 
your lord knows what they conceal in their hearts and what they disclose 
he is god  there is no god but him all praise is due to him in this world and the hereafter his is the judgement and to him you shall be returned 
ask them   tell me  if god were to extend perpetual night over you till the day of judgement  is there any deity other than god that could bring you light will you not listen  
say   tell me  if god were to extend perpetual day over you till the day of judgement    is there any deity other than god that could bring you night  in which to rest will you not then see  
in his mercy he has made for you the night and the day  during which you may rest  and seek his bounty and be grateful 
and on the day he shall call out to them and say   where are those whom you alleged were my partners  
and we shall bring forth from every people a witness and we shall say to them   bring your proof   then they will know that truth belongs to god alone  and that which they used to invent will fall away from them 
korah was one of moses people  but he behaved arrogantly towards them we had given him such treasures that their very keys would have weighed down a band of strong men his people said to him   do not exult in your riches  for god does not love the exultant 
but seek the home of the hereafter by means of that which god has bestowed on you  do not forget to take your portion of the hereafter in this world   be good to others as god has been good to you and do not strive for evil in the land  for god does not love the evil doers  
but he said   i have been given it only because of the knowledge i possess   did he not know that god had destroyed before him people who were stronger than he and possessed even greater resources the guilty are not required to offer explanations of their sins 
then he went forth before his people in all his pomp those who were eager for the life of this world said   if only we had the like of korah s fortune  he really is a very fortunate man  
but those who had been given knowledge said   woe to you  god s reward is better for those who believe and do good deeds  and it is awarded only to those who are steadfast  
then we caused the earth to swallow up him and his home  there was no one to help him against god  nor could he defend himself 
those who had coveted his position the day before now began to say   ah  it is indeed god alone who gives abundantly to whom he will and sparingly to whom he pleases had not god been gracious to us  he would have caused us to be swallowed up also   alas indeed  those who deny the truth will never prosper 
as for the abode of the hereafter  we shall assign it to those who seek neither self aggrandisement on the earth nor corruption the righteous shall have a blessed end 
he who does good shall be rewarded with something better but he who does evil shall be requited according to his deeds 
he who has entrusted you with the responsibility of the quran  will surely lead you to a successful end say   my lord knows best who is rightly guided and who is in gross error  
you never expected that this book would be revealed to you yet  by the grace of your lord  you have received it so do not support those who reject the truth 
and let no one divert you from god s revelations  once they have been sent down to you call people to your lord never be of those who ascribe partners to god 
invoke no god other than god  for there is no god but him all things are bound to perish except himself his is the judgement  and to him you shall be returned 
alif lam mim 
do people think that once they say   we believe   they will be left alone and not be put to the test 
we certainly tried those who have gone before them  so god will certainly distinguish between those who are truthful and those who are lying 
do those who do evil imagine that they will escape us how ill they judge 
he who hopes to meet god should know that god s appointed hour is sure to come he is the all hearing  the all knowing 
and whoever strives  strives only for himself  god is independent of all his creation 
as for those who have faith and do good works  we shall certainly cleanse them of their evil deeds and reward them according to the best of their actions 
we have enjoined man to show kindness to his parents but if they bid you associate with me something about which you have no knowledge  do not obey them to me you shall all return  and i shall tell you about all that you have done 
we shall surely admit those who believe and do good deeds to the company of the righteous 
some profess to believe in god  but when they suffer for god s cause they mistake the persecution of man for the punishment of god but when help comes to you from god  they will say   we have always been with you   is not god fully aware of what is in the hearts of all creatures 
most certainly god will mark out those who believe and mark out those who are hypocrites 
those who deny the truth say to the faithful   follow our way  and we will bear the burden of your sins   but they will bear none of their sins they are surely lying 
they shall bear their own burdens  and other burdens besides on the day of resurrection they shall be questioned about their false assertions 
we sent noah to his people and he lived among them for fifty short of a thousand years  then the deluge overtook them  for they were wrongdoers 
but we saved him and those who were with him in the ark and made the event a sign for mankind 
tell of abraham he said to his people   worship god and fear him  that would be best for you  if only you knew 
you worship idols besides god and fabricate falsehoods those whom you worship besides god have no power to provide sustenance for you so seek your sustenance from god and worship him and be grateful to him  for to him you shall return 
if you reject the truth  other communities before you also rejected the truth the messenger s responsibility is only to convey the message clearly  
do they not see how god originates creation  then reproduces it that surely is easy for god 
tell them   roam the earth and see how he originated creation then god will bring into being your second life god has power over all things 
he punishes whom he will and shows mercy to whom he pleases and to him you shall be returned 
you cannot defeat his purpose on earth or in heaven  nor have you any friend or helper besides god  
those who deny god s revelations and the meeting with him    it is they who have despaired of my mercy they will suffer a grievous punishment 
the only response of abraham s people was   kill him or burn him   but god saved him from the fire surely in this there are signs for people who believe 
abraham said   you have taken up the worship of idols  instead of god  to promote friendship between yourselves in the present life but on the day of judgement  you will disown and curse one another your abode will be the fire and you will have no helpers  
lot was the one who believed in him and said   i shall migrate to another land for the sake of my lord he is the mighty one  the wise one  
we gave him isaac and jacob and granted prophethood and the book to his descendants we gave him his reward in this life and in the hereafter he shall dwell among the righteous 
we sent lot to his people and he said to them   indeed you commit obscenity such as no people before you have ever committed 
you approach men and waylay them on the road and commit depravities within your gatherings   but his people s only reply was   bring down god s punishment upon us  if what you say be true  
lot prayed   lord  help me against this wicked people  
when our messengers brought abraham the good news of the birth of isaac they also said   we are indeed going to destroy the people of this city  for the people of this city are truly wrongdoers  
abraham said   but  lot lives here   they answered   we well know who lives here we shall surely save him and his whole family  except his wife  who will be among those who stay behind  
when our messengers came to lot  he was troubled and distressed on their account they said   have no fear or grief we shall certainly save you and your household  except your wife  who will be among those who stay behind 
we are surely going to bring down a punishment from heaven on the people of this town because of their depravities  
surely the ruins we left of that city are a clear sign for a people who use their reason 
to the people of midian we sent their brother shu ayb he said   my people  worship god  and look forward to the last day  and do not commit evil and spread corruption in the land  
but they rejected him  so the earthquake overwhelmed them and they were left lying prostrate on the ground in their homes 
the same happened to the tribes of ad and thamud  this must be clear to you from their ruins satan made their actions seem good to them  and turned them away from the straight path  even though they were intelligent people 
korah  pharaoh  and haman  moses came to them with clear signs but they were arrogant in the land they could not escape us 
so we seized each one for his sins  some we struck with a violent storm  some of them were overcome by a sudden blast  some were swallowed up by the earth and some we drowned god did not wrong them  they wronged themselves 
those who take protectors other than god can be compared to the spider which builds itself a cobweb  but the frailest of all structures is the house of the spider  if they but knew it 
god surely knows what they invoke besides him he is the mighty  the wise one 
such are the comparisons we make for people  but only those understand them who have knowledge 
god has created the heavens and the earth for a purpose  surely in this there is a sign for true believers 
recite what has been revealed to you of the book  and pray regularly surely prayer restrains one from indecency and evil and remembrance of god is greater god has knowledge of all your actions 
believers  argue only in the best way with the people of the book  but contend not at all with such of them as are unjust say   we believe in what has been revealed to us  and what has been revealed to you  our god and your god are one  and to him we submit  
likewise we have sent down the book to you those to whom we gave the scripture believe in it  and so do some of your own people only those who deny the truth reject our revelations 
you were not able to read any book before this  nor did you write one down with your hand if you had done so  the followers of falsehood would have had cause to doubt it 
but the quran is a revelation that is clear to the hearts of those endowed with knowledge only the evil doers refuse to acknowledge our revelations 
they say   why has no sign been given to him by his lord   say   the signs are in the hands of god i am but a plain warner  
is it not sufficient for them that we have sent you down the book to be recited to them in this surely there is a blessing and an admonition for a people who believe 
say   god is sufficient as a witness between you and me he knows all that is in the heavens and the earth those who believe in falsehood and reject god will surely be the losers  
they ask you to hasten the punishment had there not been an appointed time for it  the punishment would already have come to them indeed it will come down upon them suddenly and catch them unawares 
they ask you to hasten the punishment  but surely  hell is already encompassing those who deny the truth 
on the day the punishment envelops them from above them and from underneath their feet  they will be told   taste the punishment for what you used to do  
my servants who believe  my earth is vast  so worship me alone 
every soul shall taste death and then to us you shall return 
we shall lodge forever those who believe and do good works in the mansions of paradise beside which rivers flow how excellent is the reward of those who labour 
and who are steadfast and put their trust in their lord 
how many creatures cannot fend for themselves  god provides for them and for you he is the all hearing  the all knowing 
if you ask them who it is that has created the heavens and the earth and subjugated the sun and the moon  they will say   god   how then are they turned away 
god gives abundantly to whom he will and sparingly to whom he pleases god has full knowledge of all things 
and if you ask them who it is that sends down water from the sky and revives the earth with it after its death  they will surely answer   god   then praise be to god but most of them do not understand 
the life of this world is nothing but sport and a diversion it is the life of the hereafter which is the only true life  if they but knew it 
when they board a vessel  they call on god  sincere in their faith for him alone  but when he brings them safe to land  they begin to ascribe partners to him 
and thus they may show utter ingratitude for our favours  let them enjoy themselves for a time but they will soon come to know 
have they not seen how we have granted them a safe sanctuary  though all around them people are snatched away would they still believe in falsehood  and deny the favour of god 
who does greater wrong than he who invents a lie about god or rejects the truth when it comes to him is hell not the home for those who deny the truth 
we will surely guide in our ways those who strive hard for our cause  god is surely with the righteous 
alif lam mim 
the romans have been defeated
in a nearby land they will reverse their defeat with a victory
within a few years  for with god rests all power of decision  first and last on that day the believers too will have cause to rejoice 
with the help of god he helps whom he pleases  he is the mighty  and the merciful 
 this is god s promise never does god fail to fulfil his promise    but most people do not know this 
they only know the outward appearance of the life of this world  and they are neglectful of the hereafter 
do they not ponder about their own selves god has created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for a purpose and for an appointed time yet many deny they will ever meet with their lord 
have they not travelled through the land and seen what end their predecessors met they were mightier than them  they cultivated the earth more and built more upon it than these have ever built their own messengers also came to them with clear signs  god did not wrong them  they wronged themselves 
then the end of those who committed evil was evil  for they belied the signs of god  and they derided them 
god originates the creation  and shall repeat it  then to him you shall be returned 
on the day the hour arrives  the guilty will be struck dumb with despair 
and they will have no intercessors among those partners they ascribed to god they will deny these partners 
when the last hour dawns    on that day they will be sorted out 
those who believed and did good deeds will rejoice in a garden 
and as for those who denied the truth and belied our signs and the meeting in the hereafter    they shall be brought to the torment 
so glorify god in the evening and in the morning 
and praise be to him in the heavens and on the earth  and glorify him in the late afternoon  and at midday 
he brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living he gives life to the earth after its death  and you shall be raised to life in the same way 
one of his signs is that he created you from dust and  behold  you became human beings and multiplied yourselves throughout the earth 
another of his signs is that he created for you from among yourselves spouses  so that you might find repose in them  and he created between you affection and kindness truly there are signs in this for people who reflect 
another of his signs is that he created the heavens and earth  and the diversity of your languages and colours there truly are signs in this for those who know 
among his signs are your sleep  at night or in daytime  and your seeking his bounty there truly are signs in this for people who hear 
among his signs is this  he shows you the lightning  giving rise to both fear and hope  and sends down water from the sky  giving life thereby to the earth after it had been lifeless  in this  behold  there are signs indeed for people who use their reason 
another of his signs is this  the heavens and the earth stand firm by his command and afterwards when he calls you  behold  from the earth you will come forth 
all those in the heavens and on the earth belong to him all are obedient to him 
he is the one who originates creation  then repeats it  and it is very easy for him his is the most exalted state in the heavens and on the earth  he is the mighty  the wise one 
he sets forth for you an example taken from your own lives do you make your servants full partners with an equal share in the wealth we have bestowed upon you do you fear them as you fear each other in this way we explain the signs to people who use their reason 
and still those who are unjust follow their own desires without having any knowledge then who can guide those whom god has let go astray there shall be none to help them 
devote yourself single mindedly to the religion and follow the nature constitution as made by god  that nature in which he has created mankind there is no altering the creation of god that is the right religion but most people do not realize it 
turn to him and fear him  and be steadfast in prayer  and do not be one of those who associate partners with god 
those who split up their religion and became divided into sects  each one exulting in what they have 
when an affliction befalls men  they cry out to their lord  turning to him in repentance  but then  when he has made them taste his mercy  a section of them associate partners with their lord 
and are ungrateful for what we have given them so enjoy yourselves for a while  but soon you will come to know 
have we sent down to them any authority which speaks in favour of what they associate with him 
when we give mankind a taste of our blessing  they rejoice therein  but if they encounter tribulation because of their own actions    they fall into despair 
do they not see that god gives abundantly to whoever he pleases  and sparingly to whoever he pleases in that truly there are signs for those who believe 
so give the near relative  the needy  and the wayfarer their due    that is best for those who seek god s pleasure  such men are the ones who will surely prosper 
whatever you lend out in usury to gain in value through other people s wealth will not increase in god s eyes  but whatever you give in alms in your desire for god s pleasure will be multiplied 
god is he who created you  then provides for you  then will cause you to die and then bring you back to life can any of your  partners  do any one of these things glory be to him and exalted be he above anything they associate with him 
corruption has appeared on land and sea because of the evil which men s hands have done  and so he will make them taste the fruit of some of their doings  so that they may turn back from evil 
say   journey through the land  and see how those before you met their end    most of them  ascribed partners with god  
 prophet   set your face to the right religion  before that day comes from god which cannot be averted on that day  mankind will be parted in two 
those who rejected the truth will bear the burden of that rejection  and those who did good deeds will have made good provision for themselves 
for then he will reward out of his bounty those who believe and do good deeds  he does not love those who reject the truth 
among his signs is this  he sends out the winds bearing good news so that he may make you taste his mercy  and ships sail at his command  so that you may seek his bounty  and be grateful 
surely  we sent messengers before you to their own people  and they brought them clear signs then we took vengeance on the guilty it was certainly our duty to help the believers 
it is god who sends out the winds so that they raise the clouds then he spreads them in the sky as he wills and places them layer upon layer and you see the rain issuing forth from their midst when he causes it to fall on whichever of his servants he pleases  behold  they rejoice 
though before that  before it was sent down upon them  they were in despair 
look  therefore  at the signs of god s mercy  how he resurrects the earth after its death truly  the same god will resurrect the dead  for he has power over all things 
yet if we send a wind and they see their harvest turn yellow  they will then begin to deny our favours 
you prophet cannot make the dead hear and you cannot make the deaf hear your call when they turn their backs and leave 
just as you cannot lead the blind of heart out of their error  you cannot make anyone hear your call save those who are willing to believe in our revelations  and thus surrender themselves to us and are submissive to our will 
god is the one who has created you in a state of weakness  then he has granted you strength following your weakness  later on he has given you infirmity and grey hairs in place of strength he creates whatever he wishes  he is the all knowing and all powerful 
on the day the last hour arrives  the evil doers will swear they have not even tarried for an hour  they have always been deluded 
but those endowed with knowledge and faith will say   indeed  you did tarry  as god ordained  till the day of resurrection  and this is the day of resurrection  but you were not aware of it  
so on that day their pleas shall be of no avail  nor will they be allowed to make amends 
truly  we have set forth for men in this quran every kind of parable and indeed  if you bring them a sign  those who are bent on denying the truth are sure to say   you are only making false claims  
in this way god seals the hearts of those who do not want to know the truth  
so have patience o muhammad   god s promise is true  let not those who will not be convinced make you discouraged 
alif lam mim 
these are the verses of the book of wisdom 
a guide and a mercy for those who do good 
for those who attend to their prayers and pay the zakat and who have firm faith in the hereafter 
these are rightly guided by their lord  and these are the ones who will prosper 
but among men there are some who spend their time in idle diversions only to lead people astray from the path of god  and without knowledge  hold it up to ridicule  for such there is a humiliating punishment in store 
whenever our messages are conveyed to such a person  he turns away in his arrogance  as though he had not heard them    as though his ears were sealed  give him  then  the tidings of grievous suffering in the life to come 
surely  those who believe and do good works shall enter gardens of bliss 
wherein they will abide forever that is god s true promise  he is the mighty  the wise one 
he has created the skies without any support that you could see  and has placed firm mountains upon the earth  lest it sway with you  and has caused all manner of living creatures to multiply thereon and we sent down water from the skies  and thus we made every kind of excellent plant grow there 
this is god s creation show me then what those besides him have created  the wrongdoers are in manifest error 
we bestowed wisdom on luqman  saying   be grateful to god  he who is grateful  is grateful only for the good of his own soul but if anyone is ungrateful  then surely god is self sufficient and praiseworthy  
luqman said to his son  counselling him   my son  do not associate anything with god associating others with him is a terrible wrong  
we have enjoined man to show kindness to his parents    for his mother bears him  in hardship upon hardship  and his weaning takes two years we said give thanks to me and to your parents  all will return to me 
but if they press you to associate something with me about which you have no knowledge  do not obey them yet be kind to them in this world and follow the path of those who turn to me you will all return to me in the end  and i will tell you everything that you have done 
 luqman further said   o my son  though it be but the weight of a grain of mustard seed and though it be hidden in a rock  or in the heavens or on the earth  god will bring it forth truly  god is the knower of all subtleties and he is aware 
o my dear son  say your prayers regularly  and enjoin good  and forbid evil  and endure patiently whatever may befall you surely  this is something which requires firm resolve 
do not avert your face from people out of haughtiness and do not walk with pride on the earth  for  behold  god does not love arrogant and boastful people 
walk modestly and lower your voice  for the ugliest of all voices is the braying of the ass  
have you not seen that god has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth  and has completed his favours to you  both seen and unseen yet there are some who dispute concerning god  without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening book 
when they are told to follow the revelations that god has sent down  they say   no  we shall follow the ways that we found our fathers following   yes  even though satan is inviting them to the punishment of the burning fire 
he who submits himself completely to god  and is a doer of good  has surely grasped a strong handle  for the final outcome of all events rests with god 
but if any reject the faith  let not his rejection grieve you  for to us they shall return  and we shall tell them the truth about their deeds  for god knows well all that is in the human hearts   
we shall let them enjoy themselves for a little while  but then we shall drive them to a harsh punishment 
if you should ask them   who created the heavens and the earth   they will surely answer   god   say   praise be to god   but most of them do not understand 
whatever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god assuredly  god is self sufficient and praiseworthy 
if all the trees on earth were pens  and the sea were ink  with seven more seas added to it  the words of god would not be exhausted  for  truly  god is almighty and wise 
creating and resurrecting all of you is just like creating and resurrecting a single soul truly  god hears all and observes all 
have you not seen that god makes the night pass into the day  and makes the day pass into the night  and that he has pressed the sun and the moon into his service  each pursuing its course for an appointed term  and that god is well aware of what you do 
that is because god is the truth  and what they call upon besides him is falsehood god is the most high  the supreme one 
have you not seen how the ships sail on the sea by god s grace so that he may show you some of his signs surely therein are signs for every steadfast  thankful person 
when the waves engulf them like shadows of death   they call to god  sincere at that moment in their faith in him alone  but as soon as he has brought them safe ashore  only some of them take the right course and none denies our signs save the perfidious and ungrateful person 
o men  seek protection with your lord and fear the day when neither will the father be of any avail to his son  nor will the son be of any avail to his father god s promise is surely true so let not worldly life beguile you  nor let the deceiver deceive you concerning god 
truly  god alone has knowledge of the hour he sends down the rain  and he knows what is in the wombs no soul knows what it will earn tomorrow  and no soul knows in what land it will die surely  god is all knowing  all aware 
alif lam mim 
this book has beyond all doubt been revealed by the lord of the universe 
do they say   he has invented it himself   no indeed  it is the truth from your lord to warn a people to whom  before you  no warner came  so that hopefully they may be rightly guided 
it was god who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is in between in six days  and then he established himself on the throne you have no patron nor any intercessor besides him so will you not pay heed 
he directs all affairs from heaven to earth then all will again ascend to him on a day whose length is a thousand years by the way you measure 
such is the knower of the unseen and the visible  the powerful  the merciful 
who gave everything its perfect form he originated the creation of man from clay 
then he made his progeny from an extract of a humble fluid 
then he moulded him  he breathed his spirit into him  he gave you hearing  sight  and hearts how seldom you are grateful 
they say   when we are lost in the earth  how can we then be recreated   indeed  they deny they will ever meet their lord 
say   the angel of death who has been given charge of you will gather in your souls then you will all be returned to your lord  
if only you could see the evil doers hanging their heads in shame before their lord   our lord  we have seen and we have heard  so send us back again and we will act rightly for we do indeed now believe  
yet had we so willed  we could indeed have imposed our guidance upon every human being  but my word shall come true   i will fill hell with jinns and men all together  
we shall say to them   taste this    for you forgot you would ever meet this day we too will forget you    taste the chastisement of eternity for your evil deeds  
the people who truly believe in our messages are those who fall to the ground in prostration when they are reminded of them  and glorify their lord with praise and are not arrogant 
they forsake their beds  calling upon their lord in fear and in hope  and spend out of what we have provided them with 
no soul knows what joy is kept hidden in store for them as a reward for their labours 
so  is someone who believes equal to someone who defies god no  they are not equal 
those who believe and do good deeds shall be lodged in the gardens of paradise as a reward for what they have done 
as for those who defy god  their home shall be the fire whenever they try to escape it  they shall be driven back into it  and they shall be told   taste the torment of the fire  which you have persistently denied  
and most surely we will make them taste a lesser punishment before the greater punishment  so that perhaps they may return to us in repentance 
who does greater wrong than someone who  when revelations of his lord are recited to him  turns away from them we shall inflict retribution on the guilty 
we gave moses the scripture  so muhammad do not doubt that you are receiving it  just as we made it a guide for the children of israel 
we appointed leaders from among them  guiding by our command when they were steadfast and when they had firm faith in our signs 
surely your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ 
does it not guide them to see how many generations we destroyed before them  among whose ruined dwellings they now walk about there truly are signs in this    will they not listen 
have they not seen that we drive the water to the barren land and produce thereby crops of which their cattle and they themselves eat will they not then see 
and they say   when will this judgement come  if you are telling the truth  
say   on the day of judgement it will be of no benefit to those who were bent on denying the truth  if they then believe  they will be granted no respite  
so turn away from them and wait they too are waiting 
o prophet  have fear of god and do not yield to those who deny the truth and the hypocrites god is all knowing and all wise 
follow what is revealed to you from your lord god is aware of all that you do 
put your trust in god  god is sufficient as a guardian 
god has not placed two hearts in any man s body  nor has he made your wives    from whom you keep away by saying   be as my mother s back     your real mothers  neither he has made your adopted sons as your own sons these are merely words which you utter with your mouths  but god speaks the truth and gives guidance to the right path 
call them after their own fathers  that is closer to justice in the sight of god if you do not know their fathers  regard them as your brothers in faith and your proteges you will not be blamed if you make a mistake  you will be held accountable only for what in your hearts you have done intentionally god is forgiving and merciful 
the prophet has a higher claim on the believers than they have on their own selves  and his wives are their mothers blood relatives are closer to one another in god s book than are believers and the emigrants except that you want to show your friends a kindness that is decreed in the book 
we took a solemn pledge from the prophets  from you and noah  abraham  moses and jesus  the son of mary    we took a solemn pledge from all of them 
so that god might ask those men of truth as to what response their truthfulness had received on earth but for those who deny the truth  he has prepared a woeful punishment 
you who have attained to faith  remember god s blessings upon you when mighty armies massed against you we sent a violent wind against them and hosts that you could not see god sees all that you do 
when they came against you both from above you and from below you  your eyes rolled with fear and your hearts leapt up to your throats  and you entertained ill thoughts about god 
there the faithful were put to the proof and they were shaken as if by an earthquake 
the hypocrites and people with sickness in their hearts said   god and his messenger have promised us nothing but delusions  
others said   people of yathrib  you cannot withstand the enemy here  so go back   yet others asked leave of the prophet  saying   our houses are exposed and defenceless   they were in truth not exposed  they only wished to flee 
if their town had been stormed  and they had been incited to sedition  they would have rebelled with little hesitation 
they had already vowed before god that they would never turn their backs  and a vow made to god must be answered for 
say   flight shall not avail you  if you manage to escape from death or killing  you will enjoy life only for a short while  
say   who is there to shield you from god if he wishes to harm you if god wishes to show you mercy  who can prevent him   besides god they shall find none to protect them  and none to bring them succour 
god knows exactly who among you hold the others back  who say to their brethren   come over to our side   and they seldom take part in the fighting 
begrudging you all help  but when danger comes  you can see them looking at you with rolling eyes as if in their death throes  but once their fear has passed  they come to you and do glib talking in their greed for wealth such men have no faith  so god has foiled their actions this is indeed easy for god 
they thought the confederate tribes would never withdraw indeed  if the confederates should come again  they would prefer to be in the desert  among the bedouins there they would ask news of you from a distance but if they were with you  they would take very little part in the fighting 
you have indeed in the prophet of god a good example for those of you who look to god and the last day  and remember god always 
when the believers saw the confederates  they said   this is what god and his messenger have promised us surely the promise of god and his messenger has come true   it served to increase them in faith and submission 
among the believers there are men who have been true to the pledge they made with god among them are such as have fulfilled their vow  and some who still wait  without having changed their resolve in the least 
god will surely reward the truthful for their truthfulness and punish the hypocrites  if he so wishes  or he may accept their repentance  for god is forgiving and merciful 
god turned back those who denied the truth in their rage  without their having gained any advantage god was enough to protect the believers in battle god is strong and all powerful 
he brought down from their strongholds those people of the book who supported the aggressors and filled their hearts with terror some of them you killed and others you took captive 
he made you heirs to their lands  and their houses  and their possessions and lands on which you had not set foot before god has power over all things 
o prophet  say to your wives   if you seek the life of this world and all its finery then come  i will make provision for you  and release you honourably 
but if you seek god and his messenger and the abode of the hereafter  then know that god has prepared a great reward for those of you who do good deeds  
wives of the prophet  any one of you who commits a flagrant act of misconduct shall be doubly punished that is easy enough for god 
but those of you who obey god and his messenger and do good deeds  shall be doubly rewarded for them we have made an excellent provision 
wives of the prophet  you are not like any other women if you fear god  do not be too soft spoken in case the ill intentioned should feel tempted speak in an appropriate manner 
stay in your homes and do not flaunt your charms as in the former times of ignorance attend to your prayers  pay the zakat and obey god and his messenger women of the prophet s household  god seeks only to remove all impurity from you  and to make you completely pure 
bear in mind all that is recited in your homes of the revelations of god and of wisdom god is all pervading and all aware 
surely  for men and women who have surrendered to god    believing men and believing women  obedient men and obedient women  truthful men and truthful women  patient men and patient women  humble men and humble women  charitable men and charitable women  fasting men and fasting women  men and women who guard their chastity  men and women who are ever mindful of god    god is ready with forgiveness and an immense reward 
it is not fitting for a believing man or woman to exercise any choice in his or her own affairs once god and his messenger have reached a decision upon them anyone who disobeys god and his messenger is in manifest error 
you said to the man who had been favoured by god and by you   keep your wife to yourself and have fear of god   you sought to hide in your heart what god wished to reveal you were afraid of people  whereas it would have been more proper to fear god when zayd divorced his wife  we gave her to you in marriage  so that there should be no restriction on believers marrying the spouses of their adopted sons when they have divorced them the commandment of god must be fulfilled 
no blame shall be attached to the prophet for doing what is sanctioned for him by god this was god s way with those who went before him    and the command of god is a decree determined 
those who conveyed god s messages and fear him only  god suffices as a reckoner 
muhammad is not the father of any of your men  but is god s messenger and the seal of the prophets god has knowledge of all things 
believers  remember god often 
glorify him morning and evening 
it is he who sends blessings to you  as do his angels  so that he may bring you out of the darkness into the light he is most merciful to the believers 
on the day they meet him  they will be welcomed with the greeting   peace   he has prepared an honourable reward for them 
o prophet  we have sent forth you as a witness  as a bearer of good news and a warner 
as one who calls people to god by his leave  and guides them like a shining light 
convey to the believers the good news that god has bounteous blessings in store for them 
do not yield to those who deny the truth and the hypocrites  ignore their hurtful talk put your trust in god  god is your all sufficient guardian 
believers  if you marry believing women  and divorce them before the marriage is consummated  you are not required to observe a waiting period  make provision for them and release them in an honourable way 
prophet  we have made lawful for you the wives to whom you have given their dowers  as well as those whom your right hand possesses from among the captives of war whom god has bestowed upon you and we have made lawful to you the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts  and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts  who have migrated with you  and any believing woman who gives herself to the prophet  provided the prophet wants to marry her this applies only to you and not to the rest of the believers we know what we have prescribed for them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands may possess  in order that there may be no blame on you god is most forgiving  most merciful 
you may defer the turn of any of them that you please  and you may receive any you please  and there is no blame on you if you invite one whose turn you have set aside that is more proper  so that their eyes may be cooled  and so that they may not grieve  and so that they will be satisfied with what you have given them god knows what is in your hearts  and god is all knowing  and forbearing 
it is not lawful for you to marry more women after this  nor to change them for other wives  even though their beauty may please you  except any that your right hand possesses god is watchful over all things 
believers  do not enter the houses of the prophet  unless you are invited for a meal do not linger until a meal is ready when you are invited enter and when you have taken your meal  depart do not stay on  indulging in conversation doing that causes annoyance to the prophet  though he is too reticent to tell you so  but god is not reticent with the truth when you ask the wives of the prophet for anything  ask them from behind a curtain that will be purer for your hearts as well as their hearts it is not right for you to cause annoyance to the messenger of god or for you ever to marry his wives after him indeed that would be an enormity in the sight of god 
whether you reveal anything or hide it  god is aware of everything 
there shall be no blame on them for appearing before their fathers  their sons  their brothers  their brothers sons  their sisters sons  their women or those whom their right hands may possess women  fear god god observes all things 
god and his angels bestow blessings on the prophet o believers  you also should invoke blessings on him and give him greetings of peace 
those who annoy god and his messenger shall be cursed by god in this world and in the hereafter god has prepared for them a humiliating punishment 
those who affront believing men and believing women without their having deserved it done any wrong shall bear the weight of slander and flagrant sin 
o prophet  tell your wives and your daughters and wives of the believers that they should draw over themselves some of their outer garments when in public   so as to be recognized and not harmed god is most forgiving and most merciful 
if the hypocrites and those who have tainted hearts and the scandal mongers of madinah do not desist  we shall surely give you authority over them and their days in that city will be numbered 
accursed  wherever they are found  they will be seized and killed 
such has been god s way with those who have gone before them you shall find no change in the ways of god 
people will ask you about the hour say   god alone has knowledge of it who knows the hour may well be near at hand  
god has rejected those who deny the truth and prepared for them a blazing fire 
there they will live forever  and they will find therein neither friend nor helper 
on the day when their faces are turned over in the fire  they shall say   oh  would that we had obeyed god  and obeyed the messenger  
they shall say   our lord  we paid heed to our leaders and our elders  but they led us away from the right path 
our lord  give them double punishment and curse them with a mighty curse  
believers  do not behave like those who slandered moses god cleared him of their allegations he was honourable in the sight of god 
believers  fear god  and say the right word 
he will bless your works for you and forgive you your sins whoever obeys god and his messenger has indeed achieved a great success 
we offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains  but they refused to bear it  because they were afraid of it but man bore it  he surely proved unjust and ignorant 
god will punish the hypocrites  both men and women  and polytheists  both men and women  but god will turn in his mercy to believing men and believing women  god is most forgiving and most merciful 
praise be to god  to whom belongs all that the heavens and the earth contain and praise be to him in the hereafter he is the all wise  the all aware 
he knows whatever goes into the earth and whatever comes forth from it  and whatever descends from heaven and whatever ascends into it he is the merciful  the forgiving 
those who deny the truth declare   the hour will never come upon us   say   yes  by my lord  it will surely come upon you  who knows the unseen not the smallest particle in the heavens or the earth  or anything less or greater than that escapes him  all is recorded in an open book 
he will surely reward those who believe and do good deeds  they shall have forgiveness and an honourable provision  
but those who strive against our signs  trying to defeat them  will suffer a painful torment 
those who have been given knowledge know that what has been revealed to you from your lord is the truth  and that it guides to the path of the almighty  the praiseworthy 
those who deny the truth say   shall we point out to you a man who will tell you that when you are broken up into particles  you will be put together again in a new creation 
has he invented a lie about god  or is he afflicted with madness   indeed no it is those who do not believe in the hereafter who will suffer torment  for they have strayed far into error 
do they not observe how they are encompassed by what is before them and what is behind them in heaven and on earth we could  if we pleased  cause the earth to swallow them up  or cause a piece of the sky to fall upon them in that certainly there is a sign for every servant of ours who turns to us 
we bestowed upon david great favour we said   o mountains and birds  join with him in celebrating our praise   we softened iron for him  saying 
make full length coats of mail  measuring the links well and do righteous deeds surely  i see all that you do 
we subjected the wind to solomon  its morning course was a month and its evening course a month  and we caused a fount of molten copper to flow for him and of the jinn there were some who worked under him  by the command of his lord if any one of them turned away from our command  we would make him taste the punishment of the burning fire 
they made for him whatever he desired  palaces and statues  basins like reservoirs  and large cooking vessels fixed in their places we said   give thanks  house of david  for few of my servants are truly grateful  
when we decreed solomon s death  nothing indicated his death to them except a worm from the earth  which was eating away at his cane when he fell down  the jinn plainly realized that if they had known what was unseen  they would not have had to continue with such humiliating labour 
for the people of sheba there was a sign in their homeland  two gardens  one on the right hand and the other on the left we said to them   eat what your lord has provided for you  and be grateful you have a good land and a lord most forgiving  
yet they turned away from the truth so we let loose on them a flood from the dam and replaced their two gardens by two others bearing bitter fruits  tamarisks  and a few lote trees 
we requited them in that way because of their ingratitude we requite no one in that way but the ungrateful 
we had placed between them and the towns that we had blessed  other towns situated close to each other  and we fixed the stages of journey between them  saying   travel between them in safety by night and day  
but they said   our lord  make the stages of our journeys longer   thus they wronged themselves and we made them bygone tales and scattered them throughout the land there are certainly signs in that for everyone who is steadfast and thankful 
satan was correct in his assessment of them and they all followed him  except for a band of true believers 
but he had no authority over them  we only desired to distinguish those who believed in the hereafter from those who were in doubt concerning it your lord is watchful over all things 
call upon those whom you set up beside god  they possess not an atom s weight either in the heavens or on the earth  nor have they any share in either  nor has he any helpers among them 
no intercession avails with him  except on the part of one to whom he grants permission when their hearts are relieved of fear  they will enquire from those to whom permission is granted   what has your lord said   they will answer   the truth he is the most high  the supreme one  
ask them   who provides sustenance for you from the heavens and the earth   say   it is god   either you or we are rightly guided or in manifest error  
say to them   you will not be called to account for our sins and we shall not be called to account for what you do  
tell them   our lord will gather us together  then he will judge between us with truth and justice he is the just decider  the all knowing  
say to them   show me those whom you have joined with him as partners no indeed  for he alone is god  the mighty one  the wise one  
we have sent you as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner for the whole of mankind  but most people have no knowledge 
they ask   when will this promise be fulfilled  if you are truthful  
say   a day has already been appointed for you which you can neither delay nor advance by a single moment  
those who deny the truth say   we shall believe neither in this scripture nor in any that came before it   could you but see when the wrongdoers will be made to stand before their lord  casting blame on one another  those who had been weak will say to the arrogant ones   had it not been for you  we should certainly have been believers  
the haughty ones will then reply to the weak ones   did we keep you away from the guidance when it came to you indeed not you yourselves were the guilty ones  
those deemed weak will say to those deemed great   no  it was your scheming night and day when you commanded us to reject god and assign equals to him   but they will show their remorse when they see the punishment we will put iron collars round the necks of those who had been bent on denying the truth they will be requited only in proportion to their misdeeds 
for it has been thus whenever we sent a warner to any community its affluent ones said   we reject what you have been sent with  
they say   we have more wealth and children  and we are surely not going to be punished  
say to them   my lord increases the provision for whoever he pleases and decreases it for whoever he pleases  but most people do not know it  
it is not your wealth or your children that will confer on you nearness to us it is those who believe and act righteously who will be doubly rewarded for their good deeds  and will dwell in peace in the high pavilions of paradise  
while those who strive to thwart our messages  seeking to defeat their purpose  shall be summoned to punishment 
say to them   it is my lord who increases the provision for such of his servants as he pleases  and decreases it for such of them as he pleases whatever you spend  he will recompense you for it he is the best of providers  
on the day when he gathers them all together  he will ask the angels   was it you that these people worshipped  
they will say   glory be to you  you are our protector  not them indeed no  they worshipped the jinn  it was in them that most of them believed  
today you possess no power to benefit or harm one another we shall say to the wrongdoers   suffer the punishment of the fire that you persistently denied  
whenever our messages are conveyed to them in all their clarity  they say   this muhammad is nothing but a man who wants to turn you away from what your forefathers worshipped   and they say   this quran is nothing but an invented falsehood   and they who are bent on denying the truth speak thus of the truth when it comes to them   this is clearly nothing but plain sorcery  
we had not given them books to study  nor have we sent them a warner before you 
their predecessors also rejected the truth these have not attained to one tenth of the power that we had bestowed upon the earlier people but they rejected my messengers then how terrible  was my chastisement 
say to them   i exhort you to do one thing  and that is to stand up before god in pairs  or singly  and then reflect you will thus realize that your companion is not afflicted with madness he is only a warner  warning you of an impending severe chastisement  
say   if i have asked you for any recompense  you can keep it it is god alone who will reward me  he is the witness of all things  
say to them   my lord hurls forth the truth at falsehood and he is the knower of hidden things  
say to them   the truth has come and will endure falsehood has no power to originate any good  nor to reproduce it  
affirm   if i am in error  i shall carry the burden thereof  and if i am rightly guided  it is because of what my lord has revealed to me truly  he is all hearing and near at hand  
if you could only see when those who denied the truth are terrified  and there is no way out  and they are seized from a place nearby 
then they will say   we now believe in him   but how will they attain to faith  having gone so far away from it 
they had rejected it before  while they indulged in conjectures from far away 
and between them and their desires a barrier shall be placed as was done in the past with people of their ilk  for they were indeed in disquieting doubt 
all praise be to god  creator of the heavens and the earth  who made the angels his messengers  with wings    two  or three  or four pairs he adds to his creation whatever he wills  for god has the power to will anything 
no one can withhold the blessings god bestows upon people  nor can anyone apart from him bestow whatever he withholds  he is the almighty  the wise one 
people  remember god s favour to you is there any creator other than god who provides for you from the heavens and the earth there is no god save him how then are you turned away from the truth 
if they reject you  other messengers have been rejected before you to god all affairs will be returned 
o men the promise of god is true let not the life of this world deceive you  nor let the deceiver deceive you about god 
surely satan is your enemy  so treat him as an enemy  he calls on his followers only so that they should become inmates of the burning fire 
those who are bent on denying the truth will have a severe punishment  while those who believe and do good deeds will have forgiveness and a great reward 
is he whose evil deeds are made alluring to him so that he looks upon them as good  equal to the man who is rightly guided god leaves to stray whom he wills  and guides whom he wills do not destroy yourself with grief for them god has full knowledge of all their actions 
it is god who sends forth the winds so that they raise up the clouds we drive them to a dead land  and by them bring the earth to life after its death such is the resurrection 
if anyone seeks glory  let him know that glory belongs to god alone good words ascend to him and righteous deeds are exalted by him those who plot evil deeds shall be sternly punished and their plotting will come to nothing 
god has created you from dust  then from a drop of semen and then divided you into pairs  no female conceives or gives birth without his knowledge  and no one s life is prolonged or shortened  but it is recorded in a book that surely is easy for god 
the two seas are not alike the one is sweet  thirst quenching  and pleasant to drink from  while the other is salty and bitter yet from each you eat fresh fish and extract ornaments to wear  and in each you see the ships ploughing through the waves so that you may seek his bounty and so that you may feel thankful 
he makes the night pass into the day and he makes the day pass into the night he has subjected the sun and the moon  each running for an appointed term such is god  your lord  his is the kingdom those whom you invoke besides him do not own so much as the skin of a date stone 
if you invoke them  they do not hear your call  and even if they could hear  they would not respond to you and on the day of resurrection they will disown your having associated them with god no one can tell you the truth like the one who is all knowing 
o men  it is you who stand in need of god    god is self sufficient  and praiseworthy   
if he so wished  he could take you away and replace you with a new creation 
that is not difficult for god 
no burden bearer shall bear another s burden  and if some over laden soul should call out for someone else to carry his load  not the least portion of it will be borne for him  even though he were a near relative you can only warn those who fear their lord in the unseen  and pray regularly anyone who purifies himself will benefit greatly from doing so to god all shall return 
the blind and the sighted are not equal 
nor are the darkness and the light 
shade and heat are not alike 
nor are the living and the dead god causes whom he will to hear him  but you cannot make those who are in their graves hear you 
you are but a warner 
we have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and a warner  there is no community to which a warner has not come 
if they reject you  so did their predecessors messengers came to them with clear signs  with scriptures  and with the enlightening book 
but in the end i seized those who were bent on denying the truth and how terrible was my punishment 
did you not see how god sent down water from the sky with which we bring forth fruit of diverse colours in the mountains there are streaks of various shades of white and red  and jet black rocks 
in like manner  men  beasts  and cattle have their diverse hues too only those of his servants  who possess knowledge  fear god god is almighty and most forgiving 
those who read the book of god and attend to their prayers and spend in charity in private and in public out of what we have provided them  may hope for a commerce that suffers no loss 
he will give them their full rewards and give them more out of his bounty he is forgiving and appreciative 
the book which we have revealed to you is the truth confirming previous scriptures god knows and observes his servants 
we have bestowed the book on those of our servants whom we have chosen some wrong their own souls  some keep half way between right and wrong   some  by god s leave  excel others in good deeds this is a great bounty of god 
they shall enter the gardens of eternity  where they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls  and wear silk garments 
they will say   praise be to god who has taken away all sorrow from us our lord is forgiving and appreciative 
through his grace he has admitted us to the everlasting abode  where neither toil nor weariness affects us  
those who deny the truth shall remain in the fire of hell death will not be decreed for them  so that they could escape by way of death  nor will its torment ever be eased for them thus do we requite every ungrateful person 
there they will cry out   lord  take us out  we shall do good deeds  and behave differently from the way we used to   but he will answer   did we not make your life long enough to take warning if you were going to the warner did come to you so now have a taste of the punishment   wrongdoers will have no supporter 
god knows the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth he has full knowledge of what is in the hearts of men 
it is he who has made you inherit the earth he who denies him shall bear the burden of his denial god s displeasure with the deniers will only be increased by their denial of the truth  it will only increase their loss 
say   have you ever considered your associate gods whom you call on besides god show me what it is that they have created on earth or have they a share in the creation of the heavens   or have we given them a book so that they may act on evidence from it indeed  the wrongdoers promises to one another are nothing but deception 
surely  god holds the heavens and the earth  lest they should deviate from their places were they to deviate  none could hold them after him surely  he is forbearing and most forgiving 
they swore their most solemn oaths that if a warner should ever come to them  they would be better guided than any other community but when a warner did come to them  it only increased their aversion 
and they behaved arrogantly in the land and plotted evil but the plotting of evil only rebounds on those who plot are they but looking for the way the previous peoples sinners were dealt with you will never find any change in the ways of god  nor will you ever find god s decree averted 
have they not travelled around the earth and seen the fate of those who preceded them and they were far superior to them in strength nothing in the heavens or the earth can ever frustrate god s plans he is all knowing and all powerful 
if god were to take men to task for their misdeeds  he would not leave a single living creature on the surface of the earth  but he grants them respite until an appointed time  and when their appointed time comes  then they will know that god is indeed observant of all his servants 
ya sin 
by the quran  full of wisdom 
you are indeed one of the messengers
on a straight path 
with a revelation sent down by the mighty one  the merciful 
so that you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned and so they are unaware 
the word has been proved true against the greater part of them  they will not believe 
we have put yokes round their necks right up to their chins  so that they cannot bow their heads
and we have set a barrier before them and a barrier behind them  and we have covered them up so that they cannot see 
it makes no difference to them whether you warn them or do not warn them  they will not believe 
you can warn only those who would follow the reminder and fear the gracious god  unseen give them the good news of forgiveness and a noble reward 
we shall surely bring the dead back to life and we record what they send ahead and what they leave behind we have recorded everything in a clear book 
recount to them the example of the people to whose town our messengers came 
when we sent them two messengers  they rejected them both  so we strengthened them with a third they said   truly  we have been sent to you by god as messengers  
they replied   you are nothing but mortal men like us and the merciful god has not revealed anything you are surely lying  
they said   our lord knows that we have been sent to you 
and our duty is only to convey the message to you clearly  
but they answered   we see an evil omen in you if you do not stop  we shall certainly stone you  and you will suffer a painful punishment at our hands  
they said   your evil augury be with you  is it because you are admonished about the truth surely  you are a people transgressing all bounds  
then  from the furthest part of the city  a man came running he said   my people  follow the messengers 
follow those who ask no recompense of you and are rightly guided 
why should i not worship him who has brought me into being  and to whom you shall all be recalled 
shall i take others besides him as gods if the gracious god should intend me any harm  their intercession will be of no avail  nor can they deliver me 
in that case i should indeed be in manifest error 
indeed  i have believed in your lord  so listen to me  
we said to him   enter paradise   and he exclaimed   would that my people knew
how my lord has forgiven me and placed me among the honoured ones  
after him we did not send down against his people a host from heaven  nor do we send down such hosts 
it was but one great blast and they fell down lifeless 
alas for human beings  they ridicule every messenger that comes to them 
do they not see how many generations we have destroyed before them never shall they return to them 
all of them  gathered together  will certainly be brought before us 
there is a sign for them in the lifeless earth we revive it and we produce grain from it of which they eat 
we have placed in it gardens of date palms and vines  and caused springs to gush forth from it 
so that they may eat its fruit  though it was not their hands that made this will they not then be grateful 
holy is he who created all things in pairs  of what the earth grows  and of themselves  and other things which they do not know 
they have a sign in the night  we withdraw from it the light of day    and they are left in darkness 
the sun  too  follows its determined course laid down for it by the almighty  the all knowing 
we have ordained phases for the moon until finally it becomes like an old date stalk 
the sun cannot overtake the moon  nor can the night outpace the day  each floats in its own orbit 
another sign for them is that we carried their offspring in the laden ark 
we have created for them the like of it in which they ride 
if it were our will  we could drown them  then there would be no helper to hear their cry   nor could they be saved 
it is only by our mercy that they are granted provision for a time 
when they are told   guard yourselves against what is before you and what is behind you  in order that you may be shown mercy   they turn away 
indeed  not one of your lord s signs comes to them without their turning away from it 
and when they are told   give to others out of what god has provided for you   those who are bent on denying the truth say to the believers   why should we feed those whom god could feed if he wanted you are clearly in error  
they say   when will this promise be fulfilled  if you are truthful  
they must be waiting for but one single blast  which will overtake them while they are still disputing 
they will have no time to make a will  nor shall they return to their own people 
the trumpet will be blown and  at once  they will rise up from their graves  and hasten to their lord 
woe betide us  they will say   who has roused us from our sleep   this is what the lord of mercy promised  the messengers spoke the truth 
it will be but one blast  and they will all be brought before us together 
on that day no soul shall suffer the least injustice you shall be rewarded only according to your deeds 
the people of paradise shall be happily occupied on that day 
they and their wives  shall recline on couches in the shade 
they shall have fruits therein  and all that they ask for 
peace  shall be the greeting from the merciful lord 
 and god will say    separate yourselves from the righteous this day  you criminals 
did i not enjoin you  sons of adam  not to worship satan    for he is your sworn enemy 
but to worship me surely  that is a straight path 
yet he led astray a great multitude of you why did you not then understand 
this is the hell you were promised 
enter it this day on account of your denial of the truth  
today we shall seal up their mouths and their hands will speak to us  and their feet will bear witness to their misdeeds 
if it had been our will  we could have put out their eyes they would have struggled to find the way  but how could they have seen it 
if it had been our will  we could have paralysed them where they stood  so that they would not be able to go forward or turn back 
if we extend anyone s life  we reverse his development can they not use their reason 
we have not taught him any poetry nor would it be fitting for him this is merely a reminder and a clear quran
to warn all who are truly alive  and to justify the word god s verdict against the deniers 
do they not see that  among the things which our hands have fashioned  we have created for them cattle of which they are the masters 
we have subjected these to them  so that some may be used for riding and some for food 
some for milk to drink and some from which other benefits may be received will they not be grateful 
they have set up other gods besides god  hoping to be helped by them 
but they are not able to help them  rather they will be brought before god as their allied host 
let not their words grieve you we have knowledge of all that they conceal and all that they reveal 
does not man see that we created him from a drop yet there he is  flagrantly contentious 
producing arguments against us  and forgetting his own creation he asks   who can give life back to bones after they have rotted away  
say   he who brought them into being in the first instance will give them life again  he has knowledge of every type of creation 
he who produces fire for you from green trees and from this you kindle fire  
is he who created the heavens and earth not able to create others like these people of course he is  he is indeed the supreme creator  the all knowing 
when he decrees a thing  he need only say   be   and it is 
so glory be to him who has control over all things it is to him that you will all be brought back 
by those angels who range themselves in close ranks
and those who drive away the wicked with reproof
and by the reciters of the reminder 
your god is one 
lord of the heavens and the earth and everything between them  lord of the easts 
we have adorned the lowest heaven with the beauty of the planets 
and guarded it against all rebellious devils 
they cannot overhear the higher assembly for they are pelted from every side 
driven away  and will suffer eternal punishment 
but if anyone does succeed in snatching a glimpse of such knowledge   he shall be pursued by a piercing flame 
so  ask those who deny the truth if it was harder to create them than all the other things we have created we created them from sticky clay 
no wonder you are surprised as they laugh with scorn 
when they are reminded  they do not pay heed 
and whenever they see some sign  they ridicule it 
saying   this is plain sorcery  
what  when we have died and become dust and bones  will we be brought back to life again 
along with our forefathers  
say   yes indeed  and you will be brought low  
there will be but a single blast and then their eyes will open 
they will say   woe to us  this is the day of reckoning  
 it will be said    this is the day of judgement which you have been denying  
but we shall say   assemble those who did wrong together with their associates and what they worshipped
besides god  and lead them to the path of the fire 
and stop them there for questioning 
 but what is the matter with you that you cannot help one another    
indeed  on that day they will surrender themselves 
they will turn upon one another  and question one another 
they will say   you used to come at us from the right  
they will say   no  it was you who would not believe   
we had no power over you  but you yourselves were a rebellious people 
but now our lord s word has come true against us  truly  we are bound to taste the punishment 
we led you astray as we were ourselves astray  
on that day they will all share the punishment 
that is how we deal with evil doers 
when they were told   there is no deity but god   they turned away with disdain 
and replied   shall we then give up our deities at the bidding of a mad poet  
surely  he has brought the truth  confirming those who were sent before 
you shall surely taste the painful punishment 
and be rewarded only according to your deeds  
but the chosen servants of god 
shall have a known provision   
fruits of various kinds  and they shall be honoured 
in the gardens of bliss 
seated on couches  facing one another 
a drink will be passed round among them from a flowing spring 
white and delicious to those who drink it 
causing no headiness or intoxication 
with them will be spouses  modest of gaze and beautiful of eye 
like closely guarded pearls 
they will turn to one another with questions 
one of them will say   i had a friend 
who used to ask  do you really believe that
after we die and become dust and bones  we shall be brought to judgement  
then he will say   shall we look for him  
then he will look and see him in the midst of the fire 
he will say   by god  you almost brought me to ruin 
if it had not been for the blessing of my lord  i would also have been taken to hell  
then he will say to his blessed companions    are we not going to die 
except for our first death are we not going to be punished 
truly  this is a great victory  
it is for the like of this that all should strive 
is that better by way of hospitality or the zaqqum tree 
which we have made as a test for the wrongdoers 
for it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of hellfire 
and its fruits are like devils heads 
they will eat from it and fill their bellies with it 
then in addition to it they shall have a draught of boiling water to drink 
then surely they shall return to hell 
they found their fathers had gone astray 
so they are rushing to follow in their footsteps 
and assuredly many of the ancients went astray before them 
though we had sent warners among them 
see how those who were warned met their end 
not so the chosen servants of god 
noah cried to us  and how excellent was our response 
we saved him and his people from great distress 
and we made his offspring the only survivors 
we left mention of him among later generations 
peace be upon noah among all the peoples 
that is how we recompense the righteous 
he was truly one of our faithful servants 
we drowned the rest 
abraham was of the same faith 
he came to his lord with a sound heart 
behold  he said to his father and to his people   what are these that you worship 
would you serve false deities instead of god 
what do you think of the lord of the worlds  
he looked up at the stars 
and said   i am sick  
so they turned their backs on him and went off 
he turned to their gods and said   do you not eat 
what is the matter with you that you do not speak  
then he turned on them  striking them down with his right hand 
his people came rushing towards him 
but he said   how can you worship things you carve with your own hands 
when it is god who has created you and all your handiwork  
they said   build a pyre for him and throw him into the blaze  
they wanted to harm him  but we humiliated them all 
he said   i will go to my lord  he is sure to guide me 
lord  grant me a righteous son  
we gave him the good news that he would have a patient  forbearing son 
and when he reached the age when he could work with him  he said   o my son  i have seen in a dream that i am sacrificing you so tell me what you think of it   he replied   o my father  do as you are commanded  and god willing  you will find me steadfast  
when they had both submitted to god  and he had laid his son down on his face 
we called out to him   abraham 
you have fulfilled the dream   it is thus indeed that we reward those who do good 
that surely was a manifest trial 
we ransomed him with a great sacrifice 
and left him thus to be succeeded by a group of followers among later generations 
peace and salutation to abraham 
that is how we recompense the righteous 
truly  he was one of our faithful servants 
we gave abraham the good news of isaac  a prophet and a righteous man 
and blessed him and isaac too  some of their offspring were good  but some clearly sinned against their souls 
we also bestowed our favour on moses and aaron 
we saved them and their people from great distress 
and we helped them  so that they were victorious 
and we gave them the book which helps to make things clear 
and guided them to the straight path 
and we left them thus to be succeeded by a group of followers among later generations 
peace be upon moses and aaron 
this is how we reward those who do good 
truly they were among our faithful servants 
elijah too was one of the messengers 
he said to his people   have you no fear of god 
do you call on baal and abandon the best of creators 
god your lord and lord of your forefathers  
but they rejected him  and thus will certainly be called to account 
except the chosen servants of god 
we left him thus to be succeeded by a group of followers among the following generations   
peace be on elijah and his people 
it is thus indeed that we reward those who do good 
surely he was one of our believing servants 
lot was also one of the messengers 
we saved him and all his people 
except for an old woman who stayed behind 
and we destroyed the rest 
you pass by their ruins morning
and night  will you not take heed 
jonah too was one of the messengers 
he fled to the overloaded ship 
and then they cast lots and he was the one who lost 
and the fish swallowed him while he was blaming himself 
had he not been one of those who acknowledge the glory of god 
he would certainly have remained inside the fish till the day of resurrection 
but we caused him to be cast forth on to the beach  sick as he was 
and we caused a gourd tree to grow over him 
we sent him as a messenger to a hundred thousand people or more 
and they believed in him  so we let them live in ease for a while 
now ask them whether your lord has daughters  whereas they have sons 
did we create the angels females  to which they were witnesses 
no indeed  it is one of their fabrications when they say 
god has begotten children they are truly liars 
has he chosen daughters over sons 
what is the matter with you how do you form your judgement 
will you not then reflect 
or have you clear evidence 
then produce your scriptures  if you are telling the truth 
they claim that he has kinship with the jinn  yet the jinn themselves know that they will be produced before him for judgement 
god is far above what they attribute to him 
but not so the true servants of god 
neither you nor what you worship
can lure away from god any
except those who will burn in hell 
 the angels say    every single one of us has his place assigned 
we are those who stand ranged in ranks 
we glorify god  
they say 
if we had had with us a book like that of the people of old 
we would surely have been god s chosen servants  
but they have rejected it  the quran and they shall soon learn 
and surely our word has gone forth respecting our servants  the messengers 
that it is certainly they who will be helped 
and that it is our host that would certainly triumph 
so turn away from them for a while 
watch them  they will soon see 
do they really wish to hasten our punishment 
when it descends on their courtyards  how terrible that morning will be for those who were warned 
so turn away from them for a while 
and watch  for they will soon see 
glory be to your lord  the lord of glory is far above what they attribute to him 
peace be upon the messengers
and praise be to god  the lord of all the worlds 
sad by the quran  full of admonition 
those who deny the truth are steeped in arrogance and hostility 
how many generations we have destroyed before them  and they cried out when it was too late to escape 
they are surprised that a warner should come to them from among themselves they say   this is a magician  a great liar 
does he make all the deities out to be one god this is indeed a strange thing  
their leaders departed  saying   walk away  hold fast to your deities this is clearly a conspiracy 
we have not heard of any such thing in the old religion this is nothing but a fabrication 
was the message sent only to him out of all of us   in fact  they doubt my warning  in fact  they have not yet tasted my punishment 
do they possess the treasures of the mercy of your lord  the mighty  the great bestower 
have they control over heavens and earth and whatever lies between them then let them climb up to heaven by ropes 
this host too  among other hosts  is bound to suffer defeat 
before them the people of noah denied the truth  as did the ad and pharaoh of the stakes 
and the tribe of thamud  and the people of lot  and the dwellers of the wood    these were the confederates 
there was not one of them but treated their messengers as liars  so my punishment rightly overtook them 
they have only to wait for one single blast of punishment   it shall not be delayed by one whit 
they say   our lord  hasten on for us our fate before the day of reckoning  
bear with their words patiently remember our servant david  a man of strength who always turned to us 
we made the mountains join him in glorifying us at sunset and sunrise 
and the birds  too  in flocks  all turned to him 
we made his kingdom strong  and bestowed upon him wisdom and sagacity in judgement 
have you heard the story of the disputants who entered his chamber by climbing over the wall 
when they reached david  he took fright  but they said   do not be afraid we are two disputants  one of whom has wronged the other  judge between us fairly  do not be unjust  and guide us to the right path 
this brother of mine has ninety nine ewes and i have only one he said  let me have charge of it   and got the better of me with his words  
david said   he has certainly wronged you by demanding that your ewe be added to his ewes  thus many partners wrong one another    all save those who believe in god and do righteous deeds  but how few are they   and suddenly david understood that we were only putting him to the test  and so he asked his lord to forgive him his sins  he fell to his knees  and turned to him in repentance 
we forgave him his sins his reward will be nearness to us  a good place to return to 
we said   david  we have given you mastery over the land judge fairly between people do not follow your desires  lest they divert you from god s path  those who wander from his path will have a severe punishment  because they ignore the day of reckoning  
we did not create heaven and earth and all that is between them in vain that is the opinion of those who deny the truth woe betide those who deny the truth  when they are cast into the fire   
shall we treat those who believe and do good works the same as those who spread corruption in the land  shall we treat the pious the same as the wicked 
this is a blessed book which we sent down to you muhammad   for people to ponder over its messages  and for those with understanding to take heed 
we gave david solomon he was an excellent servant who always turned to god 
when well bred horses  which were fleet of foot were paraded before him near the close of day 
he said   i have put the love of good things above the remembrance of my lord   until the sun disappeared behind its veil and the horses disappeared from sight 
bring them back to me     he said and began to stroke their legs and their necks 
we tried solomon by placing upon his throne a lifeless body  and thereupon he turned towards us 
he prayed   lord forgive me  grant me such power as no one after me will have    you are the most generous provider  
then we subjected the wind to his power  so that it blew gently  at his behest  wherever he willed 
and also the jinn  every kind of builder and diver
and others chained in fetters 
we said   this is our gift  so give or withhold as you wish without reckoning  
his reward will be nearness to us  a good place to return to 
bring to mind our servant job who cried to his lord   satan has afflicted me with distress and suffering  
we said   stamp your foot  here is cool water for you to wash in and drink  
we restored his family to him  doubling their number as an act of grace from us  and as a reminder to all who are endowed with insight 
we said to him   take a handful of twigs in your hand and strike with that but do not break your oath   we found him steadfast what an excellent servant  he turned constantly to his lord 
remember our servants abraham  isaac  and jacob    possessors of strength and vision 
we chose them for a special purpose    proclaiming the message of the hereafter 
and  in our sight they were indeed among the select  the truly good 
remember our servants ishmael  elisha  and dhu l kifl each of them was among the just 
this is a reminder the righteous shall have a good place to return to 
the gardens of eternity with gates thrown wide open to them 
they will be comfortably seated  reclining  they will call for abundant fruit and drink 
with them  they will have pure  modest women of an equal age 
this is what you were promised on the day of reckoning 
our provision for you will never be exhausted 
but the arrogant will have the worst return 
they will burn  in hell  an evil resting place   
all this will be theirs  let them taste it    a scalding  dark  foul fluid 
and other such torments 
 and they will say to one another   do you see this crowd of people rushing headlong to join you    no welcome to them  indeed  they are headed for the fire  
they will say to them   you are not welcome  it was you who brought this on us  an evil place to stay  
adding   our lord  give double punishment to those who brought this upon us  
and they will say   how is it that we do not see here any of the men whom we used to count among the wicked 
 and whom we made the target of our derision or are they here  and our eyes have missed them  
all this is certainly true    the inhabitants of the fire will blame one another in this way 
say  prophet    i am only a warner there is no god but god  the one  the all powerful 
lord of the heavens and earth and everything between them  the almighty  the most forgiving  
say   this is momentous news 
yet you ignore it 
i had no knowledge of the exalted assembly when they argued against the creation of man  
it has only been revealed to me that i am a plain warner  
your lord said to the angels   i am about to create a human being out of clay 
and when i have formed him fully and breathed my spirit into him  prostrate yourselves before him  
thereupon the angels prostrated themselves  all of them together 
but not satan  who was too proud he became one of those who deny the truth 
god said   satan  what prevented you from prostrating yourself to what i created with my own hands were you overcome by arrogance  or are you of those who think only of themselves as exalted  
satan replied   i am better than him you created me from fire  but you created him from clay  
begone  you are accursed 
my curse will remain upon you till the day of judgement  
but satan said   my lord  grant me respite until the day of resurrection  
so he said   you are granted respite
till the appointed day  
he said   by your honour  i will lead all of them astray 
except for those among them who are your chosen servants  
god said   this is the truth  i speak only the truth 
i will fill up hell with you and every one of them who follows you  
say   i do not ask you for any recompense for this  nor am i a man of false pretentions 
this is simply an admonition to mankind 
you shall before long know its truth  
this book is sent down by god the mighty  the wise 
it is we who sent down the book to you prophet with the truth  so worship god with your total devotion 
it is to god alone that sincere obedience is due and those who take other guardians besides him say   we serve them only that they may bring us nearer to god   surely  god will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ god does not guide anyone who is bent on lying and is a disbelieving liar 
if god had willed to take a son he could have chosen anyone he pleased out of his creation  but glory be to him  he is above such things he is god  the one  the omnipotent 
he created the heavens and the earth for a true purpose  he causes the night to succeed the day and the day to succeed the night  he has subjected the sun and moon  so that they run their courses for an appointed time  he is truly the mighty  the forgiving 
he created you from a single soul  then produced its spouse from it  and he has provided for you eight heads of cattle in pairs he creates you stage by stage in your mothers wombs in a threefold darkness such is god  your lord sovereignty is his there is no god but him so what has made you turn away 
if you are ungrateful  remember that god has no need of you he is not pleased by ingratitude in his servants  if you are grateful  he is pleased to see it in you no soul shall bear another s burden you will return to your lord in the end and he will declare to you what you have done  he knows well what is in the hearts of men 
when man suffers some affliction  he prays to his lord and turns to him in penitence  but once he has been granted a favour from god  he forgets the one he had been praying to and sets up rivals to god  to make others stray from his path say   enjoy your unbelief for a little while  you will be one of the inmates of the fire  
is he who prays devoutly to god in the hours of the night  prostrating himself and standing in prayer  who is ever mindful of the life to come and hopes for the mercy of his lord like one who does not say   are those who know equal to those who do not know   truly  only those endowed with understanding will take heed 
say    god says o my servants who have believed  fear your lord for those who do good in this world will have a good reward    and god s earth is spacious truly  those who persevere patiently will be requited without measure  
say   i have been commanded to serve god  dedicating my worship entirely to him 
i have been commanded to be the first to submit  
say   i fear  if i disobey my lord  the punishment of a terrible day  
say   it is god i serve  sincere in my faith in him alone   
as for yourselves  worship anything you please besides him   say   the real losers will be those who lose themselves and all their kith and kin on the day of resurrection that is the most obvious loss 
they will have sheets of fire above them and sheets of fire beneath them   that is how god puts fear into the hearts of his servants fear me  then  my servants 
there is good news for those who shun the worship of false deities and turn to god  so give good news to my servants 
who listen to what is said and follow what is best in it these are the ones god has guided  these are the people endowed with understanding 
but what of him against whom the sentence of punishment is justified can you rescue one who is already in the fire 
but for those who truly feared their lord  there will be tall mansions  built up storey upon storey  beneath which there will be rivers flowing this is god s promise  god never fails in his promise 
have you not seen that god sends down water from the sky  guides it to form springs in the earth  and then  with it  brings forth vegetation of various colours  which later withers  turns yellow before your eyes  and then he makes it crumble away there is truly a reminder in this for those who possess understanding 
anyone whose heart god has opened up to islam possesses a light from his lord but woe betide those whose hearts have been hardened against the rememberance of god  such people are in obvious error 
god has sent down the best message  a scripture that is consimilar and oft repeated  that causes the skins of those in awe of their lord to creep then their skins and their hearts soften at the mention of god  such is god s guidance he bestows it upon whoever he will  but no one can guide those whom god leaves to stray 
what about the one who will have only his bare face to protect him from his terrible punishment on the day of resurrection the evil doers will be told   taste what you have earned  
those before them also denied the truth  and the punishment fell on them from where they did not expect 
god gave them a taste of humiliation in the life of this world  but the punishment of the hereafter is greater  if they only knew it 
we have set forth to men all kinds of parables in this quran so that they may take heed 
a quran in arabic  free from any ambiguity    so that people may be mindful 
god sets forth a parable  there are two men    one belonging to many masters  all disagreeing with one another  and the other belonging entirely to one master  are those two equal in comparison praise be to god  but most of them have no knowledge 
you will die and they too will die 
and  then on the day of resurrection you shall place your dispute before your sustainer 
who  then  is more unjust than he who lies about god and rejects the truth when it comes to him is not hell an abode for those who deny the truth 
he who brings the truth  and he who testifies to it as such    those are surely the people who are god fearing 
they will have everything they wish for from their lord such is the reward of those who do good 
god will efface their worst deeds from their record and give them their reward in accordance with the best of their actions 
is god not enough for his servant yet they try to frighten you with other deities besides him  for such as god lets go astray  there will be no guide 
but he whom god guides cannot be led astray by anyone is god not mighty and capable of retribution 
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth  they will surely reply   god   say   consider those you invoke besides him  if god wished to harm me  could they undo that harm or if god wished to show me mercy  could they withhold that mercy   say   god is sufficient for me in him let the faithful put their trust  
say   my people  do whatever is in your power    and so will i soon you shall come to know
who will suffer a humiliating torment and on whom will descend an everlasting punishment  
 o prophet  we have sent down to you the book for mankind with the truth then whoever adopts the right way  will do so for his own soul  and whoever goes astray  injures his own soul you are not their custodian 
it is god who takes away men s souls upon their death and the souls of the living during their sleep then he withholds those for whom he has ordained death and restores the souls of others for an appointed term there are certainly signs in this for those who reflect 
have they taken others for intercessors besides god say   even though they have no power nor understanding  
say   intercession is entirely in the hands of god he controls the heavens and the earth  you will all return to him  
when god alone is named  the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter shrink with aversion  but when others are named instead of him  they are filled with joy 
say   o god  originator of the heavens and earth  knower of all that is hidden and all that is manifest  you will judge between your servants regarding their differences  
if the wrongdoers possessed all that is on earth  and twice as much  they would offer it to redeem themselves from the awful suffering on the day of resurrection for god will show them what they had never anticipated 
the evil of their deeds will become apparent to them  and they will be overwhelmed by that which they used to mock 
when affliction befalls man  he appeals to us  but when we bestow a favour upon him he says   all this has been given to me because of my own knowledge   by no means  it is a trial  yet most of them do not realize it 
those who preceded them said the same thing but they gained nothing from what they did 
the very evil of their deeds recoiled upon them  today s wrongdoers shall also have the evil of their deeds recoil upon them  they will never be able to frustrate our plan 
do they not know that god grants abundant sustenance to anyone he wishes and gives sparingly to anyone he pleases surely there are signs in this for those who believe 
say  god says  o my servants  who have committed excesses against their own souls  do not despair of god s mercy  for god surely forgives all sins he is truly the most forgiving  the most merciful 
turn to your lord and submit to him before his scourge overtakes you  for then you shall not be helped 
follow the best aspect of what is sent down to you from your lord  before the scourge comes upon you unawares 
lest anyone should say   alas for me  for having neglected what is due to god  and having been one of those who scoffed  
or   if only god had guided me  i would surely have joined the god fearing  
or  he may say as he sees the punishment   would that i had a second chance  so that i could be among the doers of good  
no indeed  my revelations did come to you  but you rejected them  you showed arrogance  and were among those who deny the truth  
on the day of resurrection you will see those who uttered falsehoods about god with their faces blackened is there not enough room in hell for the arrogant 
but god will deliver them who feared him to their place of salvation no evil shall touch them  nor shall they grieve 
god is the creator of all things  he has charge of everything 
the keys of the heavens and the earth belong to him those who deny god s revelations will surely be the losers 
say   ignorant men  would you bid me worship someone other than god  
it has already been revealed to you and to those who have gone before you that if you ascribe any partner to god  all your works will come to nothing  and you will surely be among the losers 
therefore  you should worship god alone and be among the thankful 
no just estimate have they made of god  such as is due to him but on the day of resurrection  the whole earth will lie within his grasp  while heaven will be folded up in his right hand    glory be to him  exalted is he above all that they associate with him   
the trumpet shall be blown and whoever is in heaven and whoever is on earth will fall down in a swoon  except those who shall be spared by god then the trumpet will be blown again and they shall rise and gaze around them 
the earth will shine with the light of its lord  and the book will be laid open  the prophets and witnesses will be brought in  and judgement will be passed on them with fairness and none shall be wronged 
every soul will be repaid in full for what it has done he is fully aware of all that they did 
those who rejected the truth will be led to hell in throngs when they reach it  its gates will be opened and its keepers will say to them   have messengers not come to you from among yourselves  who conveyed to you the revelations of your lord and warned you about meeting him on this day   they will answer   yes  they did come   but the decree of punishment has proved true against the deniers of the truth 
they will be told   enter the gates of hell  to stay therein forever   what an evil dwelling place for the haughty 
but those who fear their lord will be led in groups towards paradise when they reach it  its gate will be opened  and its keepers will say to them   peace be upon you you have done well  enter paradise and dwell in it forever  
and they will say   praise be to god who has fulfilled his promise to us and made us the inheritors of this land  letting us settle in the garden wherever we want   how excellent is the reward of those who labour 
you shall see the angels circling about the throne  glorifying their lord with praise and judgement will have been passed in justice on all and it will be said   praise be to god  lord of the universe  
ha mim 
this book is revealed by god  the almighty  the all knowing 
the forgiver of sin and the accepter of repentance  who is severe in punishment and infinite in his bounty there is no god but him all shall return to him 
only those who deny the truth dispute god s signs do not let their activity in the land deceive you 
the people of noah and later factions also rejected the truth and every community plotted against the messenger sent to them  aiming to lay hands on him  and they contended against his message with fallacious arguments  so that they might defeat the truth  therefore i seized them how terrible was my punishment 
thus has the word of your lord come true against the deniers  they shall be the inmates of the fire 
those who bear the throne  and those who are around it  glorify their lord with his praise  and believe in him they ask forgiveness for those who believe  saying   our lord  you embrace all things in mercy and knowledge forgive those who turn to you and follow your path save them from the punishment of hell
and admit them  lord  to the eternal garden you have promised to them  together with their righteous ancestors  spouses  and offspring  you alone are the almighty  the all wise 
protect them from all evil deeds  those you protect from the punishment for evil deeds will receive your mercy    that is the supreme success  
those who deny the truth will be told   god s abhorrence of you is greater than your hatred of yourselves you were called to the faith but you denied it  
they will say   our lord  twice you have made us die  and twice you have given us life  now we have confessed our sins  is there any way out of this  
 they will be told    this is because when god alone was invoked you denied the truth  yet when others were associated with him you believed in them   judgement rests with god  the most high  the most great 
it is he who shows you his signs  and sends down provision for you from heaven  but none pays heed except the repentant 
therefore call upon god  making faith pure for him  averse as the deniers of the truth may be to it 
exalted and throned on high  he lets the spirit descend at his behest upon whichever of his servants he will  so that he may warn of the day of meeting 
the day when they shall rise up from their graves and nothing about them will be hidden from god  to whom shall the kingdom belong that day   it shall belong to god  the one  the all powerful 
that day every soul shall be requited for what it has earned on that day none shall be wronged and god is swift in reckoning 
 o prophet forewarn them of the approaching day  when hearts will leap up to the throats and choke them  when the wrongdoers will have no friend  nor any intercessor who will be listened to 
 for he is aware of the most stealthy glance  and of all that the hearts conceal 
god will judge with justice and truth  but those whom they invoke besides him  have no power to judge at all surely  god is all hearing  all seeing 
have they not travelled through the land and seen what was the end of those who have gone before them they were stronger than them and made a more impressive mark upon the land  yet god destroyed them for their sins  they had no one to defend them against him 
that was because their messengers came to them with clear signs but they rejected them so god seized them  he is powerful  severe in punishment 
we sent moses with our signs and clear authority
to pharaoh  haman and korah but they said   a magician  a liar  
when he came to them with the truth from us  they said   slay the sons of those who believe with him and spare only their daughters     the schemes of those who denied the truth were futile 
pharaoh said   let me kill moses  let him call upon his lord  i fear that he may cause you to change your religion  or that he may cause disorder in the land  
moses replied   i seek refuge with my lord and your lord from every arrogant person who does not believe in the day of reckoning  
a believer  a man from among the people of pharaoh  who had concealed his faith  said   would you slay a man merely because he says   my lord is god   he has brought you clear signs from your lord  and if he is lying  the sin of his will be on his own head  but if he is truthful  a part of that of which he warns you will surely befall you certainly  god does not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar 
my people  yours is the kingdom today  you have dominion in the land  but who will help us against the scourge of god if it befalls us   but pharaoh said   i point out to you only that which i consider right  and i guide you to the right path  
the believer said   my people  i fear for you a fate like that of the people of old 
like the fate of the people of noah  ad  thamud  and those who came after them    god never wills injustice on his creatures 
my people  i fear for you the day you will cry out to one another 
the day when you will wish to turn your backs and flee  having none to defend you against god  for he whom god lets go astray can never find any guide 
joseph came to you before with clear signs  but you never ceased to doubt the message he brought you when he died  you said  god will not send another messenger    in this way god leaves the transgressors and doubters to go astray   
those who dispute god s revelations without any authority are doing something that is greatly abhorrent to god and to the believers that is how god seals up the heart of every arrogant oppressor 
pharaoh said   o haman  build for me a lofty building so that i may gain access
to the heavens  so that i may look upon the god of moses  i am convinced that he is a liar   that is how pharaoh s evil actions were made to look fair in the eyes of pharoah  and he was turned away from the path of truth pharaoh s scheming led to nothing but ruin 
the believer said   my people  follow me  i will guide you to the right path 
o my people  the life of this world is only a temporary provision  and the hereafter is the permanent abode 
whoever does evil will be requited with evil  but whoever does good  whether male or female  and is a believer  will enter the garden  where they will be provided for without measure 
my people  how is it that i call you to salvation  while you call me to the fire 
you call upon me to deny god and to serve other deities about which i have no knowledge  while i call you to the almighty  the forgiver 
surely that to which you call me has no say in this world or in the life to come  that our return is to god alone  and that the transgressors shall be the inmates of the fire 
soon you will remember what i say to you  i shall entrust my affair to god  for god is observant of all his servants  
thus  god delivered him from the evils which they plotted  and the companions of pharaoh themselves were encompassed by a dreadful scourge 
they will be brought before the fire morning and evening on the day the hour comes  a voice will cry    mete out to pharaoh s people the harshest punishment  
when they dispute with one another in the fire  the weak will say to those who deemed themselves mighty   we were your followers  will you then relieve us of some of the fire  
but those who had been arrogant will say   we are all in this together god has judged between his servants  
those in the fire will say to its keepers   implore your lord to relieve our torment for one day  
but they will say   did not your messengers come to you with clear signs   they will say   yes   the keepers will say   then pray for help yourselves   but the prayer of those who deny the truth is of no avail 
most surely we help our messengers  and those who believe  in the life of this world and on the day when all the witnesses will stand up 
the day when their excuses will be of no avail to the wrongdoers  the curse shall be their lot and they will have the most evil abode 
we gave moses our guidance  and made the children of israel the inheritors of the book   
a guide and an admonition to men of understanding 
so be patient  for what god has promised is sure to come ask forgiveness for your sins  praise your lord morning and evening 
as for those who  with no authority to do so  dispute god s messages  there is nothing in their hearts but a feeling of greatness which they will never attain seek refuge in god  for he is the all hearing  the all seeing 
certainly  the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind  but most people do not know this 
the blind and the sighted are not equal  just as those who believe and do good works and those who do evil are not equal  how seldom you reflect 
the final hour is sure to come  without doubt  but most people do not believe 
your lord has said   call on me  and i will answer your prayers   but those who are too arrogant to worship me will certainly enter hell  in disgrace 
it is god who has given you the night in which to rest and the day in which to see god is truly bountiful to people  but most people do not give thanks 
such is god  your lord  the creator of all things there is no god but he how then are you being turned away from him 
thus  indeed  those who deny the signs of god turn away from him 
it is god who has given you the earth for a resting place and the heavens for a canopy he shaped you  formed you well  and provided you with good things such is god  your lord  so glory be to him  the lord of the universe 
he is the living one there is no deity save him so pray to him  making religion pure for him only praise be to god  the lord of the universe 
say   i have been forbidden to invoke those whom you invoke besides god    seeing that clear signs have come to me from my lord  and i have been commanded to submit to the lord of the universe  
it is he who created you from dust  then from a drop of fluid  then from a tiny  clinging form  then he brought you forth as infants  then he allowed you to reach maturity  then he let you grow old  though some of you die sooner  and reach your appointed term so that you may reflect 
it is he who gives life and death  and when he ordains a thing  he says only   be   and it is 
do you not see how those who dispute god s signs  are turned away from the right path   
those who reject the book and that with which we sent our messengers shall soon know   
when  with iron collars and chains around their necks  they are dragged
into the boiling water and then are thrown into the fire 
and then they will be asked   where are those whom you associated with god  
they will say   they have been lost to us  nay  we did not invoke anything before that had real existence   thus god leaves the deniers of the truth to stray 
that is because you exulted in the land without justification and because you behaved insolently 
enter the gates of hell to stay therein forever the abode of the arrogant is evil 
so be patient prophet   for god s promise is true  whether we show you part of what we have promised them in this life  or cause you to die first  it is to us that they will be recalled 
before your time we sent other messengers  of them there are some whose story we have related to you  and some whose story we have not related to you it was not possible for any messenger to bring a sign except by the leave of god  but when the command of god was issued  the matter was decided in truth and justice there and then  those who stood on falsehoods perished 
it is god who provides livestock for you  some for riding and some for your food 
you have other benefits in them too you can reach any destination you wish on them  they carry you by land  as ships carry you on the sea 
he shows you his signs  which then of the signs of god will you deny 
have they not travelled in the land to see the fate of those who went before them they were more numerous and mightier and left greater traces of their power on the earth  yet all that they accomplished was of no avail to them 
when messengers came to them with clear signs  they revelled in whatever knowledge they had  and so they were engulfed by the very punishment they mocked 
but when they saw our punishment  they said   we believe in god  the one god  and we reject the partners we used to associate with him  
but believing after seeing our punishment did not benefit them at all  this is the law of god to deal with his creatures  and thus the disbelievers were the losers 
ha mim 
a revelation from god   the most gracious  the most merciful   
a book whose revelations are well expounded  an arabic quran for people who possess knowledge 
proclaiming good news and a warning yet most of them turn away and so do not listen 
and they say   our hearts are encased against that to which you call us  and there is a heaviness in our ears  and there is a barrier between us  so do as you will and so shall we  
say   i am only a human being like yourselves it has been revealed to me that your god is one god so take the straight path to him and ask his forgiveness   woe to those who associate others with him 
who do not pay the zakat  and who deny the hereafter 
the ones who believe and perform good deeds shall have a reward which will never be withheld from them 
say   what  do you indeed deny him who created the earth in two days periods and do you set up equals with him he is the lord of the universe  
he placed firm mountains on the earth  and blessed it he measured out its means of sustenance all in four days  this is for those who ask for it 
then he turned to heaven when it was vapour and said to it and to the earth   come willingly or unwillingly   they both said   we come willingly  
and in two days he formed seven heavens  and revealed to each heaven its functions  and we adorned the lower heaven with brilliant lamps stars and guarded it that is the decree of the almighty  the all knowing 
if they turn away  then say   i warn you of a lightning bolt like the one which struck the ad and the thamud 
when the messengers came to them from before them and behind them  saying  worship none but god   they said   if our lord had willed  he would have sent down angels to us therefore  we shall never believe in your message  
as for the tribe of ad  they behaved arrogantly in the land without any justification and said   who is mightier than we in power   did they not see that god  who created them  was mightier than they in power still they continued to deny our signs 
so we let loose upon them a raging wind over several inauspicious days  so that we might make them taste the torment of humiliation in the life of this world  and surely the torment of the hereafter will be more humiliating they shall have none to help them 
as for the thamud we offered them our guidance  but they preferred blindness to guidance so the lightning bolt of the punishment of humiliation seized them on account of their misdeeds 
we saved those who had attained to faith and were god fearing 
on the day that the enemies of god shall be gathered together and driven to the fire  they shall be formed into groups  and
when they come close to it  their ears  eyes and skins will testify against them for their misdeeds 
and they will ask their skins   why did you bear witness against us   and their skins will reply   god  who gives speech to all things  has given speech to us as well   it was he who created you in the first instance and to him you are now brought back 
you could not hide yourselves from your ears and your eyes and your skins to prevent them from testifying against you  and you thought that god would never know much of what you did 
but these thoughts which you entertained concerning your lord  have brought you to destruction  and now you are among the utterly lost  
even if they are patient  the fire will still be their homes and if they pray to be allowed to make amends  they will not be allowed to do so 
we assigned to them companions who made their doings appear fair to them but the same decree of punishment proved true against them  which had proved true against nations of jinn and mankind who passed away before them surely they were the losers 
those who deny the truth say   do not listen to this quran drown it out with noise  so that you may gain the upper hand  
therefore  we will most certainly make those who are bent on denying the truth taste a severe punishment and we will most certainly requite them according to the worst of their deeds 
that is the reward of the enemies of god  the fire will be their everlasting home  a reward for their rejection of our revelations 
those who deny the truth will say   our lord  show us those jinn and men who misled us and we shall trample them underfoot  so that they may be among the lowest of the low  
as for those who affirm   our lord is god   and then remain steadfast  the angels will descend on them  saying   have no fear and do not grieve rejoice in the good news of the garden that you have been promised 
we are your companions in this life and in the hereafter therein you shall have all that your souls desire  and therein you shall have all that you ask for
as a rich provision from one who is ever forgiving and most merciful  
who speaks better than one who calls to god and does good works and says   i am surely of those who submit  
good and evil deeds are not equal repel evil with what is better  then you will see that one who was once your enemy has become your dearest friend 
but no one will be granted such goodness except those who exercise patience and self restraint    no one is granted it save those who are truly fortunate 
if a prompting from satan should stir you  seek refuge with god  he is the all hearing and the all knowing 
among his signs are the night and the day  and the sun and the moon do not prostrate yourselves before the sun and the moon  but prostrate yourselves before god who created them all  if it is truly him that you worship 
if they grow arrogant  remember that those who are with your lord glorify him night and day and never grow tired 
among his signs is this  you see the earth dry and barren  but when we send down on it water  it stirs and swells  most surely he who gives it life is the giver of life to the dead  surely he has power over all things 
those who distort the meaning of our message are not concealed from us who is better    someone who will be thrown into the fire or someone who will arrive in safety on the day of resurrection do as you will  he sees whatever you do 
those who reject the reminder the quran when it comes to them are the losers    truly it is a mighty book 
falsehood shall not reach from before or from behind it is a revelation from the wise  the one worthy of all praise 
nothing is said to you but what was said indeed to the messengers before you  surely your lord is the lord of forgiveness but also the lord of painful retribution 
had we sent this as a quran in a language other than arabic  they would have said   why are its verses not clearly explained what  an arab prophet  and a scripture in a foreign tongue   say   it is a guide and a healing to those who believe  but for those who do not believe  there is a deafness in their ears  and a covering over their eyes  they are as it were being called from a very distant place  
we gave moses the book  but differences were created concerning it  and had it not been for a word that had already gone forth from your lord  the matter would have been decided between them  and certainly they are in grave doubt about it 
whoever does what is just and right  does so for his own good  and whoever does evil  does so to his own detriment  and god is never in the least unjust to his creatures 
he alone has knowledge of the hour of judgment and no fruit emerges from its husk  nor does any female become pregnant or give birth  without his knowledge on the day he will call out to them   where are my associates   they will reply   we declare to you that none of us can bear witness to them  
 the deities they invoked before will have vanished  they will know that there is no escape 
man never tires of asking for the good things of life  but if evil fortune befalls him  he abandons all hope  giving himself up to despair 
when we give him a taste of some of our mercy  after some adversity has touched him  he is sure to say   this is my due i do not think that the hour is going to come and even if i return to my lord  he will surely reward me well   but truly we shall tell those who deny the truth all that they did  and shall make them suffer a hard punishment 
when we grant a blessing to a man  he turns away and draws aside  but when any evil touches him  he is full of endless prayers 
say to them   have you considered  if this quran is really from god and you still reject it  then who could be more astray than someone who has drifted far away from the truth  
we shall show them our signs in the universe and within themselves  until it becomes clear to them that this is the truth is it not enough that your lord is the witness of all things 
yet they still doubt that they will ever meet their lord surely  he encompasses all things 
ha mim 
 ayn sin qaf 
thus god  the powerful  the wise  sends revelation to you as he did to those before you 
all that is in the heavens and earth belongs to him  he is the exalted  the almighty 
the heavens are almost split asunder from above as the angels sing their lord s praise and seek forgiveness for those on earth god is indeed the most forgiving  the most merciful 
and as for those who take protectors besides him  god is watching them and you are not a guardian over them 
thus we revealed to you  this arabic quran so that you may warn the mother of cities makkah and those around it  and warn them of the day of gathering which is sure to come  when some group will be in the garden  and some will be in the fire 
had god so willed  he could have made all of them one community  but he admits into his mercy whom he wills  and the wrongdoers have neither protector  nor helper 
have they taken for themselves protectors other than him but it is god who is the real protector he resurrects the dead  and he has power over all things 
in whatever you may differ  o believers the verdict thereon rests with god say  therefore    such is god  my lord  in him i have placed my trust  and to him i always turn  
creator of the heavens and the earth  he has made spouses for you from among yourselves  as well as pairs of livestock by means of which he multiplies his creatures nothing can be compared with him  he is the all hearing  the all seeing 
he is in complete control of heaven and earth  he gives abundantly to whoever he wills and gives sparingly to whoever he wills he has full knowledge of all things 
god has ordained for you the same religion which he enjoined on noah  and which we have revealed to you  and which we enjoined upon abraham and moses and jesus  so that you should remain steadfast in religion and not become divided in it what you call upon the polytheists to do is hard for them  god chooses for himself whoever he pleases and guides towards himself those who turn to him 
they became divided only after knowledge had reached them  out of mutual jealousy had it not been for a decree already passed by your lord  to reprieve them till a specified period  the matter would surely have been decided between them those who inherited the book after them are indeed in grave doubt  amounting to suspicion about it 
so call people to that faith and hold fast to it yourself as you are commanded  and do not be led by their desires  but say   i believe in the book which god has sent down  and i am commanded to do justice between you  god is our lord and your lord  we are responsible for what we do and you are responsible for what you do there is no contention between us and you god will gather us together  for to him we shall return  
as for those who argue about god after he has been accepted  their arguments will carry no weight with their lord  and his wrath will fall upon them severe punishment awaits them 
it is god who has sent down the book with the truth and the scales of justice what will make you realize that the hour might well have drawn near 
those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it  but those who believe in it dread it  and know it to be the truth those who dispute the hour have gone far astray 
god is most gracious to his creatures  he provides sustenance for whoever he wills    for he alone is the powerful one  the almighty 
to him who desires a harvest in the life to come  we shall grant an increase in his harvest  whereas to him who desires but a harvest in this world  we may give something thereof    but he will have no share in the blessings of the life to come 
do they have associate gods who have laid down for them a religion without the permission of god had it not been for god s decree on the final judgement  the matter would have been decided between them surely the wrongdoers shall have a painful punishment 
you will see the wrongdoers fearful of the consequences of their deeds  which will be inescapable whereas  those who have believed and done righteous deeds  will be in the meadows of the garden and shall have whatever they desire from their lord that will be the supreme favour 
these are the glad tidings which god gives to his servants who believe and do righteous deeds say   i do not ask of you any reward for it  except that i am inviting you to god because of love of kinship   whoever earns a good deed  we shall increase its good for him  god is most forgiving  most appreciative 
do they say   he has invented a lie about god  if god so willed  he could seal your heart god wipes out falsehood and vindicates the truth by his words he has full knowledge of what is in men s hearts   
he accepts repentance from his servants and pardons their sins he knows everything you do 
he responds to those who believe and do good deeds  and gives them more of his bounty  agonizing torment awaits the deniers of the truth 
if god were to grant his abundant provision to all his creatures  they would act insolently on earth  but he sends down in due measure whatever he will  for he is well aware of his servants and watchful over them 
it is he who sends rain after they have despaired and spreads his mercy far and wide he is the protector  worthy of all praise 
among his signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and all the living creatures he has dispersed throughout them  he has the power to gather them all together whenever he will 
whatever misfortune befalls you is of your own doing  god forgives much 
you cannot escape him anywhere on earth you have no protector or helper other than god 
among his signs are the ships sailing like mountains on the sea 
if he willed  he could bring the wind to a standstill and they would lie motionless on the surface of the sea  truly there are signs in this for anyone who is steadfast and grateful 
or he may cause them to founder because of people s misdeeds  he pardons many of them 
those who dispute our signs shall learn that they have no escape 
whatever you have been given is only a temporary provision of this life  but that which is with god is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their lord 
who refrain from heinous sins and gross indecencies  who forgive when they are angry 
who respond to their lord and attend to their prayers  who conduct their affairs by mutual consultation and spend out of what we have provided for them 
who  when they are attacked  defend themselves 
let harm be requited by an equal harm but whoever pardons and amends will find his reward with god he does not love the wrongdoers 
those who defend themselves after they have been wronged cannot be held blameworthy 
blame falls only on those who wrong men and transgress on this earth without justification  such will have a painful punishment 
whoever is patient and forgiving  acts with great courage and resolution 
anyone whom god lets go astray will thereafter have no protector whatsoever  you will see the wrongdoers  when they face the punishment  exclaiming   is there no way back  
you will see them exposed to the fire  abject in humiliation  glancing furtively at it  while those who believed will say   the losers are those ones who have forfeited their souls and their people on the day of resurrection   truly  the wrongdoers will remain in everlasting torment 
they will have no allies to help them against god  there is no way forward for those whom god lets go astray 
respond to your lord before a day arrives that will not be averted against god s will you will not find any refuge from god on that day  nor will you have any opportunity to deny your sins 
now if they turn away  we have not sent you o prophet as their keeper  your responsibility is only to convey the message man is such that when we let him taste our mercy  he exults in it  but if an evil befalls him which is his own doing  he becomes utterly ungrateful 
god has control of the heavens and the earth  he creates whatever he will    he grants female offspring to whoever he will  male to whoever he will 
or both male and female  and he leaves whoever he will barren  he is all knowing and all powerful 
it is not granted to any human being that god should speak to him other than by revelation or from behind a veil  or by sending him a messenger  so that the messenger may reveal  by his command  whatsoever he will truly  he is exalted and wise 
we have thus revealed a spirit to you prophet by our command  you knew neither the scripture nor the faith  but we made it a light  guiding with it whoever we will of our servants you are indeed guiding to the straight path 
the path of god  to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth indeed all matters return eventually to god 
ha mim 
by the book that makes things clear 
we have made it an arabic quran so that you may understand 
truly  it is inscribed in the original book  in our keeping  it is sublime and full of wisdom 
should we withdraw the admonition from you because you are a people far gone in transgression 
we have sent many a prophet to earlier peoples
but whenever a prophet came to them  they mocked him 
so we destroyed those who were mightier than these  such was the example of the earlier peoples 
if you ask them   who has created the heavens and the earth    they will surely answer   the almighty  the all knowing one has created them  
who has made the earth a cradle for you and made thereon paths for you so that  hopefully  you may find your way
it is he who sends water down from the sky in due measure  we revive dead land with it and likewise you will be resurrected from the grave 
it is he who created all living things in pairs and gave you ships to sail in and beasts to ride upon
so that you may sit firmly on their backs then once you have mounted them  remember your lord s favour and say   glory be to him who has subjected these creatures to us  we would never on our own have subdued them 
and to our lord we shall surely return  
yet they make some of his servants partners in his divinity man is clearly ungrateful 
has he then taken daughters out of his own creation and chosen sons for you 
when any of them is given the news of the very thing i e a female child which he himself has ascribed to the all merciful  his face darkens and he is filled with grief   
  do you ascribe to god one who is brought up among ornaments and who cannot produce a cogent argument  
they consider the angels  god s servants  to be female did they witness their creation their claim will be put on record and they will be questioned about it 
they say   if the all merciful had so willed  we would not have worshipped them   they have no knowledge of that they are only conjecturing 
have we given them a book before this  to which they are holding fast 
no indeed  they say   we have found our fathers following a certain course  and we are guided by their footsteps  
whenever we sent a messenger before you to warn a township  the affluent among them said  in the same way   we saw our fathers following this tradition  we are only following in their footsteps  
each messenger said   what if i should bring you better guidance than what you found your forefathers had   they replied   we reject any message you have been sent with  
so we wreaked our vengeance on them  now see what was the end of those who rejected the truth  
call to mind when abraham said to his father and his people   i disown utterly that which you worship 
 i worship only him who created me  and he will certainly guide me  
and he left these words to endure among his descendants  so that they might return to god 
yes  i gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers  until the truth came to them  and a messenger expounding things clearly 
but when the truth came to them  they said   this is sorcery  and we reject it  
they said   why was this quran not sent down to one of the great men of the two cities  
is it they who apportion the mercy of your lord it is we who distribute among them their livelihood in the life of this world  and raise some of them above others in rank  so that they may take one another into service  and the mercy of your lord is better than the wealth which they amass 
if it were not that all mankind might have become one community of disbelievers   we could have given all those who deny the lord of mercy  houses with roofs of silver  silver staircases to ascend 
and silver doors to their houses and silver couches on which to recline 
and ornaments of gold but all of these are but the provision of this present life  it is the life to come that the lord reserves for those who fear him 
as for one who turns away from the remembrance of the gracious god  we appoint for him a devil  who will become his intimate companion 
devils divert men from the right way  while they think that they are rightly guided 
when such a person comes to us  he will say to his comrade    if only you had been as far away from me as east is from west what an evil comrade  
it will be said to such a person    you have done wrong having partners in punishment will be of no avail to you today  
can you prophet make the deaf hear or guide either the blind or those who are in manifest error 
even if we take you away from the world  we shall surely take vengeance on them
or we shall show you what we have promised them  for surely we have complete power over them 
so  hold fast to the book that has been revealed to you  you are surely on the right path 
it is certainly a reminder to you and to your people and you will soon be called to account 
ask those of our messengers whom we sent before you   did we ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the beneficent one  
we sent moses with our signs to pharaoh and his nobles he said   i am the messenger of the lord of the universe  
but when he came to them with our signs  they ridiculed them 
even though each sign we showed them was greater than the previous one we afflicted them with torment so that they might return to the right path 
they said   sorcerer  call on your lord for us  by virtue of his pledge to you  we shall certainly accept guidance  
but when we relieved them of the torment  they broke their word 
pharaoh called to his people   my people  is the kingdom of egypt not mine and these rivers that flow at my feet  are they not mine do you not see 
am i not better than this contemptible man who can hardly make his meaning clear 
and why have not armlets of gold been bestowed on him and why is there not a train of angels accompanying him  
in this way he fooled his people and they obeyed him  they were a rebellious people 
then when they provoked our wrath  we took revenge on them and drowned every one of them 
we made them a precedent  an example for later peoples 
when jesus the son of mary is held up as an example  your people raise an outcry on this 
saying   are our gods better or him      they cite him only to challenge you  they are a contentious people   
but he was only a servant we favoured and made an example for the children of israel 
if we had so wished  we could have appointed angels in exchange for you to succeed you on the earth 
he is a sign of the hour have no doubt about it but follow me this is a straight path 
do not let satan bar your way he is truly your sworn enemy 
when jesus came with clear signs  he said   now i have come to you with wisdom  in order to make clear to you some of the things about which you dispute  therefore fear god and obey me 
for god  he is my lord and your lord  so worship him  that is a straight path  
the various factions among them differed    woe then to those who did wrong  they will suffer the punishment of a painful day 
are they merely waiting for the hour  which will come upon them suddenly and take them unawares 
on that day  friends will become each other s enemies  except the righteous   
o my servants  you need not fear this day  nor shall you grieve   
those who believed in our revelations and surrendered themselves to us 
enter the garden rejoicing  both you and your spouses 
dishes and goblets of gold will be passed around them with all that their souls desire and their eyes delight in  there you will remain forever 
this is the garden which you will inherit by virtue of your past deeds 
and there is abundant fruit in it for you to eat  
as for the evil doers  they shall endure forever the torment of hell 
from which there is no relief  they will remain there in utter despair 
we have not wronged them  it was they who were the wrongdoers 
they will cry   master  if only your lord would put an end to us   but he the angel will answer   no  you are here to stay  
we have certainly brought the truth to you  but most of you have an aversion for the truth 
have they determined upon a course then we too are determined 
do they imagine we do not hear their secret talk and their private counsels on the contrary  our messengers angels are at their sides  recording everything 
say   if the all merciful had a son  i would be the first to worship him  
but    exalted be the lord of the heavens and earth  the lord of the throne    he is far above their false descriptions 
so leave them alone to indulge in vain discourse and amuse themselves until they come face to face with that day which they have been promised 
it is he who is god in heaven  and god on earth  he is the wise one  the all knowing 
blessed be he who has sovereignty over the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them he alone has knowledge of the hour  and to him you shall be returned 
those whom they invoke besides god have no power of intercession  only those who bear witness to the truth and they know 
and if you ask them who created them  they will surely say  god how then are they turned away 
the prophet has said   lord  truly they are a people who do not believe  
then bear with them o muhammad and say   peace   they will soon come to know 
ha mim 
by the book that makes things clear 
surely we sent it down on a blessed night  we have always sent warnings 
on that night every wise decree is specified
by our own command    we have been sending messages 
as a mercy from your lord  he hears all and knows all 
he is the lord of heaven and earth and all that is between them  if only you would really believe 
there is no deity save him  it is he who gives both life and death    he is your lord  and the lord of your forefathers 
yet  they toy with their doubts 
wait  then  for the day when the sky brings forth plainly visible clouds of smoke 
that will envelop the people this will be a painful punishment 
then they will say   lord  relieve us from this torment  for truly we are now believers in you  
how can they benefit from admonition  seeing that a messenger had already come to them explaining things clearly 
then they turned away from him and said   he is a madman  taught by others  
were we to ease the torment for a while  you would still revert to denial of the truth 
on the day we inflict the direst scourge upon all sinners  we will certainly exact retribution 
we tried the people of pharaoh before them  a noble messenger was sent to them 
saying   hand over god s servants to me i am a trustworthy messenger for you 
do not set yourselves above god  i bring you clear authority 
i have sought refuge with my lord and your lord lest you stone me to death 
if you do not believe in me  at least keep away from me  
then he cried out to his lord   these are sinful people  
god said   set out with my servants by night  for you will certainly be pursued 
leave the sea behind you parted  they are a host destined to be drowned  
how many gardens and fountains they left behind them 
and cornfields and splendid buildings 
and pleasant things in which they delighted 
such was their end  and what had been theirs we gave to other people to inherit 
neither heaven nor earth wept for them  nor were they allowed any respite 
we saved the children of israel from their humiliating torment
at the hands of pharaoh  he was a tyrant who exceeded all bounds 
we knowingly chose them above all other people
and showed them signs in which there was a clear test 
yet those who deny the truth say 
there is nothing beyond our first death  we shall not be raised again 
so bring our fathers back   if what you say is true 
are they better than the people of tubba and those who came before them we destroyed them  because they were guilty of sin 
we did not idly create the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them 
we did not create them save with a purpose  yet most people have no knowledge of this 
truly  the day of decision is the appointed time for all of them 
the day when no friend shall be of the least avail to another  nor shall any be helped 
save those to whom god shows mercy surely  he is the mighty  the merciful one 
surely the fruit of the zaqqum tree
shall be food for the sinners 
like the dregs of oil  it shall boil in their bellies 
like the boiling of hot water 
 a voice will cry    seize him and drag him into the midst of hell 
then pour boiling water over his head as punishment 
taste this  you who considered yourself the mighty  the honourable 
this is what you doubted  
but those mindful of god will be in a safe place 
among gardens and springs 
dressed in fine silk and in rich brocade  and they will face each other 
so it will be we shall wed them to maidens with large  dark eyes 
they will call therein for every kind of fruit  in peace and security 
they will not taste death therein  save the first death god will save them from the torment of hell
as an act of grace that will be the supreme triumph 
we have made this quran easy to understand  in your own language  so that they may take heed 
wait then  they too are waiting 
ha mim 
this scripture is sent down from god  the mighty and wise one 
there are signs in the heavens and the earth for those who believe 
in your own creation and all the creatures he has spread about  there are signs for people of sure faith 
and in the succession of night and day  and in the means of subsistence which god sends down from the skies  giving life thereby to the earth after it had been lifeless  and in the circulation of the winds  in all this there are signs for people who use their reason 
these are god s revelations  which we recite to you in all truth but if they deny god and his revelations  in what message will they believe 
woe to every sinful liar 
he hears god s revelations being recited to him  yet persists in his arrogance as if he had never heard them forewarn him of a painful punishment 
when he learns something of our revelations  he derides them  for such there will be humiliating torment 
in front of them is hell  and of no profit to them is anything they may have earned  nor any protectors they may have taken to themselves besides god  for them there shall be a terrible punishment 
such is our guidance  those who reject their lord s revelations shall suffer a woeful punishment 
it is god who has subjected the sea to you so that you may sail thereon by his command  and so that you may seek his bounty  and so that you may be grateful 
he has subjected whatever is in heaven and on the earth to you  it is all from him in that are signs for those who ponder 
tell the believers to ignore those who do not believe in the coming of the days of god he will requite people for what they have done 
whoever does what is just and right  does so for his own good  and whoever does evil  does so to his own detriment  and you shall all return to your lord 
we gave scriptures  wisdom and prophethood to the children of israel  and provided them with good things and favoured them over all other people 
we gave them clear arguments in matters of religion it was only after knowledge came to them that they differed among themselves out of mutual rivalry on the day of resurrection your lord will judge between them regarding their differences 
then we set you on a clear path of religion   so follow it  and do not yield to the desires of those who have no knowledge 
they can be of no avail to you against god the wrongdoers are friends of one another  while the friend of the righteous is god 
this book brings enlightenment and guidance to mankind  and is a blessing for those who have firm faith 
do those who commit evil deeds imagine that we shall deal with them in the same way as we deal with those who have attained to faith and do righteous deeds  that they will be alike in their living and their dying how badly they judge 
god has created the heavens and the earth for a true purpose  so that every soul may be rewarded for whatever it has earned  and no one will be wronged 
 prophet   consider the one who has taken his own desire as a deity  whom god allows to stray in the face of knowledge  sealing his ears and heart and covering his eyes    who can guide such a person after god has abandoned him will you not take heed 
they say   there is nothing but our life in this world  we die  we live  nothing but time destroys us   they have no knowledge of this  they only follow conjecture 
whenever our clear revelations are recited to them  their only argument is to say   bring back to us our forefathers  if what you say be true  
say   god gives you life  then causes you to die  and then will gather you together for the day of resurrection  about which there is no doubt but most people do not know it  
to god belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth  on the day when the hour comes  those who follow falsehood will be the losers 
you will see every people on their knees  every people shall be summoned to its record and a voice will say    today you will be requited for your deeds 
this record of ours will declare the truth about you  we have been recording whatever you have been doing  
those who believed and did good deeds will be admitted by their lord into his mercy    that shall be the manifest triumph 
but those who rejected the truth will be asked    when my revelations were recited to you  were you not arrogant and did you not persist in wicked deeds 
when it was said to you   god s promise is true  there is no doubt about the hour   did you not reply  we do not know what the hour is we think it to be nothing but a conjecture  and we are not convinced  
the evil of their actions will then become clear to them the punishment they mocked will engulf them 
it will be said to them   this day we shall forget you  as you yourselves forgot that you would meet this day your abode shall be the fire  and you shall have no helpers 
that is because you made a mockery of god s revelations and were deluded by the life of this world   therefore  today they will not be brought out of the fire  nor will they be allowed to make amends 
praise  then  be to god  lord of the heavens  and lord of the earth  the lord of all the worlds 
all greatness belongs to him in the heavens and earth he is the almighty  the all wise 
ha mim
this book is sent down from god  the almighty  the wise one 
we created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them purely for just ends  and for a specific term  but those who reject faith turn away from what they have been warned of 
say   have you thought about those you call upon apart from god show me what they have created on the earth or do they have a share in the heavens bring me a book revealed before this or some other vestige of knowledge  if you are telling the truth 
and who is more misguided than one who invokes  besides god  such as will not answer him until the day of resurrection  and who in fact are not even aware of his call 
and when mankind are gathered together  they will become their enemies  and will deny their worship 
and whenever our clear revelations are recited to them and the truth is brought to them  those who deny the truth say   this is plain magic  
do they mean to say that the messenger himself has fabricated it say o muhammad    if i have fabricated it myself  you will not be able to do anything to save me from god he knows quite well what talk you indulge in he is enough as a witness between me and you  and he is the forgiving  the merciful one  
say   i am not the first of god s messengers  and i do not know what will be done with me or with you  i do not follow anything but what is revealed to me  and i am merely a plain warner  
say   have you thought  what if this quran really is from god and you reject it what if one of the children of israel testifies to its similarity to earlier scripture and believes in it  and yet you are too arrogant to do the same god certainly does not guide evil doers  
those who deny the truth say of the believers   if there were any good in this quran  they would not have believed in it before we did   and since they refuse to be guided by it  they say   this is an ancient fabrication  
yet the scripture of moses was revealed before it as a guide and a blessing  and this is a book in the arabic language  fulfilling previous prophecies   to forewarn those who do evil and to bring good news to those who do good 
surely those who say   our lord is god   and remain firm on that path shall feel no fear  nor shall they grieve 
it is they who are the people of paradise  they shall abide therein as a reward for all that they have done 
we have enjoined on man kindness to his parents  his mother bore him  in pain and in pain she gave birth to him  and his bearing and weaning takes thirty months at length  when he reaches the age of full maturity and attains forty years  he says   o my lord  help me to be grateful for your favours which you have bestowed upon me  and upon both my parents  and to do good deeds that will please you grant me righteousness in my offspring truly  i have turned to you and  truly  i submit to you  
we accept from such people the best of what they do and we overlook their bad deeds they will be among the people of paradise    this is a true promise that has been given to them 
but he who says to his parents   shame upon you  do you threaten me with being taken out of the grave after death while many a generation has passed away before me and none has risen from among them   the parents both cry for god s help and say to him   believe  alas for you  god s promise is true   but he says   these are nothing but ancient fables  
it is against such as these that the word of god has proved true  along with all the communities that went before them  jinns and humans  surely they are losers 
all will be ranked according to their deeds we will requite them in full for their actions and they will not be wronged 
on the day when those who deny the truth are brought before the fire  it will be said to them   you have had the good things of the life of this world  and you enjoyed them now this day you shall be requited with humiliating punishment  because you were arrogant in the land without justification  and because you acted rebelliously  
tell of the brother of ad  when he warned his people in the sand dunes    and indeed warners came and went before him and after him    saying   worship none but god  surely i fear for you the punishment of an awful day  
but they said   have you come to us to turn us away from our deities then bring down upon us what you threaten us with  if you are truthful  
he said   god alone knows when it will come  and i deliver to you the message with which i am sent  but i see you are a people who are ignorant  
so  when they saw it in the shape of a dense cloud approaching their valleys  they exclaimed   this is only a heavy cloud which will bring us welcome rain   but hud said    by no means  it is the very thing which you sought to hasten    a wind bearing grievous suffering
which will destroy everything at its lord s behest   and in the morning there was nothing left to be seen save their empty dwellings  thus we repay the evil doers 
we had empowered them to an extent which we have not empowered you  o people of later times   and we had endowed them with hearing  and sight  and hearts  but neither their hearing  nor their sight  nor their hearts were of the least avail to them  since they went on rejecting god s revelations  and they were overwhelmed by the very thing which they had been wont to deride 
we have also destroyed other towns that once flourished around you  we had given them various signs so that they might return to the right path  
so why did their gods not help them  those they set up as gods besides god to bring them nearer to him no indeed  they failed them utterly  it was all a lie  a fabrication of their own making 
remember how we sent to you a band of jinn who wished to hear the quran and as they listened to its recitation  they said to one another   be silent and listen   and  then when it was finished  they went back to their people  to give them warning 
they said   o our people  we have heard a book  which has been sent down after moses  fulfilling the predictions existing in previous scriptures  it guides to the truth  and to the right path 
our people  respond to the one who calls you to god believe in him  god will forgive you your sins and protect you from a painful punishment 
but he who does not respond to god s calls can never elude him on earth  nor can he have any protector against him such people have clearly gone far astray  
have they not seen that god  who created the heavens and the earth and was not wearied by their creation  has the power to bring the dead back to life yes  indeed  he has power over all things 
on the day when those who deny the truth will be brought before the fire  they shall be asked   is this not the truth   they will reply   yes  by our lord   he will say   then taste the punishment  because of your denial of the truth  
have patience  then  as had the steadfast messengers before you  and be in no haste about them on the day when they see what they are threatened with  it will appear to them as though they had not tarried longer than an hour of a day your responsibility is to deliver the message  and none but the disobedient shall be destroyed 
god will bring to naught all the good deeds of those who are bent on denying the truth and bar others from the path of god 
as for those who believe and do good deeds and believe in what has been revealed to muhammad  and it is the truth from their lord  god will remove their sins from them and set their condition right 
that is because the ones who deny the truth follow falsehood  while those who believe follow the truth from their lord thus god sets forth comparisons for mankind 
when you meet those who deny the truth in battle  strike them in the neck  and once they are defeated  make them prisoners  and afterwards either set them free as an act of grace  or let them ransom themselves until the war is finally over thus you shall do  and if god had pleased  he would certainly have exacted retribution from them  but his purpose is to test some of you by means of others as for those who are killed in god s cause  he will never let their deeds be in vain 
he will guide them and improve their condition 
he will admit them into the garden he has already made known to them 
believers  if you succour god  he will succour you and make your footsteps firm 
but as for those who are bent on denying the truth  destruction will be their lot  and god will make their deeds come to nothing 
it is because they are averse to what god has revealed that he has rendered their deeds futile 
have they not travelled the earth and seen how those before them met their end god destroyed them utterly  a similar fate awaits those who deny the truth 
that is because god is the protector of the believers  and those who deny the truth have no protector at all 
god will admit those who believe and do good deeds to gardens through which rivers flow those who deny the truth may take their fill of pleasure in this world  and eat as cattle do  but the fire will be their ultimate abode 
how many towns we have destroyed  greater in strength than your city which has driven you out  and there was no one to help them 
can then he who takes his stand on clear evidence from his god be likened to those for whom the evil that they do is made to look beautiful  and who follow their own desires 
here is a description of the garden promised to the righteous  therein are rivers of water which is forever pure  and rivers of milk of which the taste never changes  and rivers of wine  a delight to those who drink it  and rivers of pure honey and in it they will have all kinds of fruit  and will receive forgiveness from their lord can those who enjoy such bliss be like those who abide in the fire and who are given boiling water to drink so that it tears their bowels 
among them are those who listen to you  but then  when they leave your presence  say to those who have been given knowledge scripture    what was that he just said   such are those whose hearts god has sealed  and who follow their own base desires 
but as for those who follow guidance  he adds to their guidance  and shows them the way to righteousness 
are they awaiting the hour of doom to come upon them suddenly its signs have already come but of what avail will their admonition be to them when it has actually come upon them 
know then that there is no god except god ask forgiveness for your wrongdoing  and for the men and women who believe god knows both your movements and your lodging 
those who believe ask why no chapter about fighting has been sent down yet when a decisive chapter that mentions fighting is sent down  you can see the sick of heart looking at you prophet as if they were under the shadow of death therefore  woe to them 
obedience and saying what is just would become them more  when the decision is taken  it would be better for them if they acted sincerely towards god 
then if you turn away  you are likely to spread corruption on the earth and sever your ties of kinship 
such are those whom god has rejected  making their ears deaf and their eyes blind 
will they not  then  ponder over this quran or are there locks upon their hearts 
surely  those who turn their backs on this message after guidance has been shown to them  do it because satan has embellished their fancies and god gives them respite 
because they say to those who abhor what god has revealed   we will obey you in some matters   god knows their secrets 
then how will it be when the angels take their souls  beating them on their faces and their backs 
because they followed the way that made god wrathful  and hated to adopt the way of his pleasure so he made their actions come to nothing 
do the sick at heart imagine that god will not bring to light their malice 
now had we so willed  we could have shown them clearly to you  and then you could have identified them by their marks  but surely you will know them by the tone of their speech  god knows all that you do 
most certainly we will try you until we have discovered those among you who strive their hardest  and those who are steadfast  and will test your record 
surely  they who are bent on denying the truth and on barring others from the path of god  and oppose the messenger when they have been shown guidance  cannot harm god in any way he will cause all their deeds to come to nothing 
believers  obey god and obey the messenger  do not let your deeds go to waste   
surely those who reject the truth and bar others from the path of god  then die as deniers of the truth  will not be granted forgiveness by god 
so do not lose heart or appeal for peace when you have gained the upper hand god is with you and will never let your works go to waste 
the life of this world is only a game  a pastime  but if you believe and are mindful of god  he will recompense you and will not ask you for your wealth 
if he were to ask it wealth of you  and continued to press you  you would be niggardly  and this would show your ill will 
behold  you are those who are called upon to spend for god s cause  but among you are those who are niggardly  and whoever stints does so against his own self indeed  god is self sufficient  but you stand in need of him   and if you turn back  he will bring in your place another people  who will not be like you 
truly  we have granted you a clear victory
so that god may forgive you your past and future sins and complete his favour to you and guide you to a straight path 
and so that god might bestow on you his mighty help 
it was he who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the believers  to add faith to their faith    the forces of the heavens and earth belong to him  he is all knowing and all wise   
and so that he might admit the believers  men and women  into gardens through which rivers flow  to dwell therein forever  and so that he may remove their evils from them  that is  indeed  a supreme triumph in god s eyes 
and so that he might punish hypocritical men and women as well as the polytheists men and women who think evil thoughts about god  an evil turn of fortune will fall upon them  for god has become angry with them  and has rejected them and prepared hell for them how evil is such a destination 
the forces of heavens and earth belong to god  he is almighty and all wise 
we have sent you forth as a witness and a bearer of good tidings and a warner 
so that you may believe in god and his messenger  and may help him  and honour him  and so that you may glorify god morning and evening 
behold  all who pledge their allegiance to you indeed pledge their allegiance to god  the hand of god is over their hands hence  he who breaks his oath  breaks it only to his own loss whereas he who remains true to what he has pledged to god  shall have a great reward bestowed upon him by god 
those desert arabs who remained behind will say to you   our belongings and our families kept us occupied  so ask forgiveness for us   they will say with their tongues what is not in their hearts say   who then has any power at all to intervene on your behalf with god  if his will is to do you harm  or if he intends to do you good indeed  god is well aware of all that you do  
no you thought that the messenger and the believers would never return to their families  this prospect seemed pleasing to your hearts  and you conceived evil thoughts  and thus were doomed to perish 
for those who deny the truth  who do not believe in god and his messenger  we have prepared a blazing fire 
to god belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth he forgives whom he pleases  and punishes whom he pleases and god is most forgiving and merciful 
when you believers set off to gather the spoils  those that stayed behind will say   let us come with you   they want to change god s word  but tell them   you shall not follow us god has declared this beforehand   then they will say   you are jealous of us   but how little they understand 
say to the desert arabs who stayed behind   you shall be called against a mighty people  then shall you fight  unless they submit then if you prove obedient  god will grant you a good reward  but if you turn back as you did before  he will inflict on you a painful punishment   
the blind  the lame  and the sick will not be blamed   god will admit anyone who obeys him and his messenger to gardens through which rivers flow but whoever turns back shall be severely punished by him 
god was pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you prophet under the tree  he knew what was in their hearts and so he sent tranquillity down to them and rewarded them with a victory near at hand
and with many future gains    god is mighty and wise 
god has promised you many future gains  and he has given you these in advance  and he has restrained the hands of men from harming you  so that it may be a sign for the believers  and so that he may guide you to a straight path 
and there are yet other gains which are still beyond your grasp  but which god has already encompassed for you   for god has power over all things 
if those who deny the truth were to fight you  they would certainly turn their backs  then they would find neither protector nor helper 
such was the law of god in the past  and you shall find no change in the law of god 
it is he who withheld their hands from you  and your hands from them in the valley of makkah  after giving you victory over them god sees what you do 
it was they who were bent on denying the truth  and who debarred you from the sacred mosque and who prevented your offering from reaching its place of sacrifice and had it not been for the believing men and believing women in makkah whom you might unwittingly have trampled underfoot  and on whose account you might have  unknowingly  become guilty  god would have commanded you to fight it out with them  but he ordained it thus so that he may bring whoever he will into his mercy if they the believers had been clearly separated  we would have punished those who were bent on denying the truth with a painful punishment 
while those who deny the truth made it a prestige issue in their hearts   the bigotry of the days of ignorance  god sent his tranquillity down on to his messenger and believers and firmly established in them the principle of righteousness  for they were indeed better entitled to it and more worthy of it god has full knowledge of all things 
god has in all truth shown his messenger a true vision in which he said   god willing  you will most certainly enter the sacred mosque in safety and without fear  shaven headed or with hair cut short     god knew what you did not  and has given you a victory beforehand 
he is the one who has sent his messenger with guidance and the true religion  so that he may have it prevail over all other religions god suffices as a witness 
muhammad is the messenger of god those who are with him are firm and unyielding towards those who deny the truth  but compassionate towards one another you see them bowing and prostrating themselves  seeking the grace of god and his good will their marks are on their faces  the traces of their prostrations  they are described in the torah and in the gospel as being like a seed which sends forth its shoot  then makes it strong  it then becomes thick  and it stands firm on its own stem  delighting the sowers he seeks to enrage the disbelievers through them god has promised forgiveness and a great reward to those of them who believe and do good works 
believers  do not push yourselves forward in the presence of god and his messenger fear god    god hears all and knows all 
believers  do not raise your voices above the voice of the prophet  and do not speak as loudly when speaking to him as you do when speaking to one another  lest your actions come to nothing without your realizing it 
those who lower their voices in the presence of god s messenger are men whose hearts god has tested for piety  they shall have forgiveness and a great reward 
those who call out to you from outside your apartments are lacking in understanding 
if they waited patiently until you came out to see them  it would be better for them but god is forgiving and merciful 
believers  if an evil doer brings you news  ascertain the correctness of the report fully  lest you unwittingly harm others  and then regret what you have done 
and know that the messenger of god is among you if he were to obey you in many things  you would suffer for it however  god has endeared the faith to you  and beautified it in your hearts  and has made denial of the truth  wickedness  and disobedience hateful to you people such as these are rightly guided
through god s bounty and favour  god is all knowing  and wise 
if two parties of believers fight against each other  make peace between them  then if after that one of them transgresses against the other  fight the party that transgresses until it submits to the command of god then if it complies  make peace between them with equity  and act justly truly  god loves the just 
surely all believers are brothers so make peace between your brothers  and fear god  so that mercy may be shown to you 
believers  let not some men among you ridicule others  it may be that the latter are better than the former  nor should some women laugh at others  it may be that the latter are better than the former  do not defame or be sarcastic to each other  or call each other by offensive nicknames how bad it is to earn an evil reputation after accepting the faith  those who do not repent are evil doers 
believers  avoid much suspicion indeed some suspicion is a sin and do not spy on one another and do not backbite would any of you like to eat his dead brother s flesh no  you would hate it fear god  god is ever forgiving and most merciful 
mankind  we have created you from a male and female  and made you into peoples and tribes  so that you might come to know each other the noblest of you in god s sight is the one who fears god most god is all knowing and all aware 
the arabs of the desert say   we have believed   say to them   you have not believed yet  say rather   we have submitted   for faith has not yet entered into your hearts but if you will obey god and his messenger  he will not detract anything from your good deeds god is most forgiving and ever merciful  
the believers are only those who have faith in god and his messenger and then doubt not  but strive  hard with their wealth and their persons for the cause of god such are the truthful ones 
say   do you presume to teach god your religion when god knows everything in the heavens and earth god has knowledge of all things  
they think they have done you a favour by becoming muslims  say   do not consider your islam a favour to me no indeed  it is god who bestowed a favour on you by guiding you to the true faith admit this   if you are telling the truth  
god knows the unseen things of the heavens and the earth god sees all that you do 
qaf by the glorious quran 
indeed  they are astonished that a warner should have come to them from among themselves so these deniers of the truth say   this is indeed a strange thing 
to come back to life after we have died and become dust that is most improbable  
we know very well what the earth takes away from them  we hold a book which records all things 
but they denied the truth when it came to them  so they are in a state of confusion 
have they not observed the sky above them and marked how we have built it and adorned it  leaving no flaws in it 
we spread out the earth and set upon it solid mountains and we brought forth from it all kinds of delightful plants 
as a lesson and reminder for every human being who turns to god 
and we have sent down from the sky blessed water with which we have brought forth gardens and grain to be harvested 
and tall palm trees with their thickly clustered dates 
as a provision for human beings  and by all this we bring dead land to life such shall be the resurrection 
before them  the people of noah and the people of rass denied this truth  and so did the people of thamud 
and the tribe of ad  and pharaoh  and the brethren of lot 
and the dwellers of the wood  and the people of tubba   every one denied their messengers  and so my warning came true 
were we then worn out by the first creation yet they are in doubt about a second creation 
we created man    we know the promptings of his soul  and are closer to him than his jugular vein   
and the two recording angels are recording  sitting on the right and the left 
each word he utters shall be noted down by a vigilant guardian 
the trance of death will come revealing the truth  that is what you were trying to escape 
the trumpet will be sounded this is the day you were warned of 
each person will arrive attended by an angel to drive him on and another to bear witness 
you were heedless of this  but now we have removed your veil  so your sight today is sharp 
his companion attendant will say   i have here his record ready  
cast into hell every ungrateful  rebellious one 
hinderer of good  transgressor  causing others to doubt 
who has set up another god besides god  cast him into severe punishment    
and his associate satan will say   lord  i did not make him transgress  he had already gone far astray himself  
god will say   do not quarrel in my presence i gave you the warning beforehand
and my word shall not be changed  nor am i unjust to my servants  
on that day  we shall ask hell   are you now full   hell will answer   are there any more  
paradise will be brought near to the righteous and will no longer be far away 
this is what you were promised    this is for everyone who often turned to god and kept him in mind 
who fears the compassionate one  though he is unseen  and comes to him with a penitent heart 
so enter it in peace this is the day of everlasting life 
there they shall have all that they desire  and there is even more with us 
how many a generation  far greater in prowess  have we destroyed before them  they searched the entire land  but could they find a refuge 
there is truly a reminder in this for whoever has a heart  whoever listens attentively 
we created the heavens  the earth  and everything between them in six days periods nor were we ever wearied 
so bear with patience what they say  and glorify your lord with his praise  before the rising and before the setting of the sun 
proclaim his praise in the night and at the end of every prayer 
hearken  the day when the caller will call from near 
the day when men will hear the fateful cry  they will rise up from their graves 
truly  it is we who give life and cause death  and to us shall all return
on the day the earth will be rent asunder over them  and from it they shall emerge in haste to assemble them all is easy enough for us 
we know best what those who deny the truth say you are not there to force them  so remind  with this quran  those who fear my warning 
by the winds that scatter the dust 
and those that bear the burden of the rain  
and those speeding along with ease 
and distributing the command of god at his behest 
what you are promised is certainly true 
the judgement will surely come to pass   
by the heaven full of tracks 
surely you are deeply at variance as to what to believe   
he is turned away from the truth who is destined to be so turned away 
may the conjecturers perish 
who flounder in the depths of ignorance 
they ask   when will the day of judgement come  
it will be the day when they are tormented at the fire 
taste your trial this is what you sought to hasten 
surely the god fearing will find themselves in the midst of gardens and springs 
they shall receive what their lord will bestow on them they have done good works in the past 
sleeping little in the night time 
praying at dawn for god s pardon 
and sharing their possessions with the beggars and the deprived 
on the earth  and in yourselves 
there are signs for firm believers do you not see then 
in heaven is your sustenance  and also that which you are promised 
by the lord of the heaven and the earth  it is certainly the truth it is as true as your ability to speak 
have you heard the story of abraham s honoured guests 
when they came to him they said   peace   he answered   peace   saying to himself  they are strangers  
then he turned quickly to his household  and brought a fatted calf 
and placed it before them  will you not eat   he said 
beginning to be afraid of them but they said   don t be afraid   and they gave him the good news of a son who would be endowed with knowledge 
then his wife came forward  crying and beating her brow she said   i am surely a barren  old woman  
such is the will of your lord  they replied  he is the wise  the all knowing  
abraham asked   what is your errand  o messengers  
they replied   we have been sent to a sinful people 
so that we may bring down upon them a shower of stones of clay 
which are marked by your lord for the punishment of those guilty of excesses  
we saved all the faithful in the town 
we found in it only one household of true believers   
and we left therein a sign for those who fear a painful punishment 
there is another sign in moses  we sent him to pharaoh with clear authority 
but he turned his back  he and his courtiers  and said   this is a sorcerer or a madman  
then we seized him and his army and cast them all into the sea  he himself pharaoh was to blame 
there is another sign in the tribe of ad  when we sent against them a life destroying wind
and it destroyed everything over which it passed and reduced it to dust 
in the thamud there was another sign   when they were told   make the most of your lives for a while  
but they rebelled against the command of their lord so the thunderbolt overtook them while they looked on 
they could not stand up again  nor could they defend themselves 
 we destroyed the people of noah before them they were certainly a sinful people 
we built the universe with our might  giving it its vast expanse 
we have spread out the earth  how well we have spread it out 
and we created pairs of all things so that you might reflect 
therefore hasten to god  truly  i am sent by him to give you clear warning 
do not set up another god  along with god i come from him to warn you plainly 
likewise  there came no messenger to those before them  but they said   he is a sorcerer or a madman  
have they handed this down to one another they are certainly a people who exceed all bounds 
so ignore them  you are not to blame 
but keep on exhorting them  for exhortation benefits the believers 
i created the jinn and mankind only so that they might worship me 
i seek no sustenance from them  nor do i want them to feed me   
it is god who is the great sustainer  the mighty one  the invincible 
the wrongdoers will meet the same fate as their predecessors  let them not ask me to hasten on the punishment  
woe  then  to those who are bent on denying the truth  when the day arrives which they have been promised 
by the mount sinai 
and by the scripture penned
on unrolled parchment 
by the much visited house 
and by the lofty vault of the sky 
and by the swelling sea 
the punishment of your lord shall certainly come to pass 
there is no one who could avert it 
on the day when the skies are convulsed 
and the mountains shudder and shake 
woe on that day to those who deny the truth 
who divert themselves with idle chatter 
on that day they shall be ruthlessly thrust into the fire of hell 
this is the fire which you used to deny 
is this magic or do you not see 
now enter it whether you behave patiently or impatiently will make no difference  you are only being repaid for what you have done 
truly  the god fearing will dwell on that day in gardens and in bliss 
rejoicing in whatever their lord has given them their lord has saved them from the torment of the fire 
eat and drink with good cheer as a reward for your good deeds 
reclining on couches arranged in rows and we shall wed them to fair maidens with large beautiful eyes 
to those who have attained to faith we shall unite their offspring who have also followed them in faith  and we shall not let any of their good deeds go unrewarded  every human being is a pledge for whatever he has earned 
we shall provide them in abundance with such fruit and meat as they desire 
there  they shall pass from hand to hand a cup which does not lead to any idle talk or sin 
they will be waited upon by immortal youths  like pearls hidden in their shells 
they will converse with one another  putting questions to each other 
before this  when we were among our families  we were full of fear of god s displeasure   
god has been gracious to us and has saved us from the torment of hell s intense heat   
before this  we used to pray to him surely  he is the beneficent  the merciful  
therefore continue to give warning  for by the grace of your lord  you are not a soothsayer or a madman 
if they say   he is but a poet  we are waiting for some misfortune to befall him  
say to them    wait then  i too am waiting along with you     
is it their minds that prompt them to say this  or are they merely insolent people 
or do they say   he has invented it himself  indeed  they are not willing to believe 
let them produce a scripture like it  if what they say is true 
were they created out of nothing  or are they their own creators 
did they create the heavens and the earth no  they have no faith 
do they own the treasures of your lord  or have they been given charge of them 
have they a ladder up to heaven by means of which they can overhear then let their listeners bring a clear proof 
does god have daughters while you have sons 
or do you ask them for a reward  so that they are over burdened by debt 
do they possess knowledge of the unseen  so that they can write it down 
do they want to hatch some plot those who deny the truth will be the victims of the plot 
or have they a god other than god exalted be god over what they ascribe as partners to him  
if they should see a part of the heavens falling down  they would say   a mass of clouds  
so leave them alone till they face the day on which they will be struck dumb 
the day when none of their scheming will be of the least avail to them  and they will receive no succour 
truly  for those who do wrong there is a punishment besides that  though most of them do not know it 
so wait patiently for the judgement of your lord    you are certainly under our watchful eye and glorify and celebrate the praises of your lord when you rise up from your sleep 
extol his glory at night  and at the setting of the stars 
by the setting star 
your companion has neither strayed nor is he misguided 
nor does he speak out of his own desire 
it the quran is nothing but revelation sent down to him 
he was taught by an angel who is mighty in power 
and endowed with wisdom  who in time manifested himself 
standing poised at the highest point on the horizon 
then came down close
until he was two bow lengths away or even closer
and revealed to god s servant what he revealed 
the heart of the prophet did not misconstrue what he saw 
will you then dispute with him as to what he saw 
and certainly he saw him descend a second time 
by the lote tree beyond which none may pass
by the garden of eternal repose 
when the lote tree was covered in mystic splendour 
his sight did not waver nor was it unduly bold 
he saw some of the greatest signs of his lord 
have you really considered al lat and al  uzza 
and the third one  manat   
what  for you the males and for him the females 
that indeed is an unfair division   
these are nothing but names which you yourselves have devised  you and your forefathers god has sent down no authority for them they follow nothing but conjecture and what their own selves desire  even though guidance has already come to them from their lord 
shall man have whatever he craves 
but it is to god that the hereafter and this world belong 
there may be countless angels in heaven  but their intercession will be of no avail until god has given permission to those whom he chooses and accepts 
those who do not believe in the life to come call the angels by female names 
they have no knowledge to base this on they merely indulge in guess work which can never replace the truth 
so ignore those who turn away from our revelation and seek nothing but the life of this world 
that is the ultimate extent of their knowledge surely your lord knows best those who stray from his path and he knows best those who follow his guidance 
everything in the heavens and on the earth belongs to god and so he will requite those who do evil in accordance with their deeds and will reward those left with that which is best  for those who do good 
as for those who refrain from committing grave sins and indecent acts  though they may commit minor offences  your lord is unstinting in his forgiveness he knows you when he brings you out of the earth  and when you were embryos in the wombs of your mothers  so do not make claims to be pure he knows best who is truly righteous 
have you prophet considered the man who turned away 
who at first gave a little  then later held back 
has he knowledge of the unseen  so that he sees 
has he not been made acquainted with what was written in the scriptures of moses 
and with abraham who kept his word 
that no soul shall bear the burden of another 
and that man shall have only that for which he strives 
and that the fruit of his striving shall soon be seen 
and in the end he will be repaid for it in full 
that all things in the end shall return to god 
that it is he who brings laughter and tears 
that it is he who causes death and gives life 
and that he himself created the two sexes  male and female 
from an ejected drop of sperm 
and that he will bring about the second creation 
that it is he who gives wealth and possessions 
that he is the lord of sirius 
it was he who totally destroyed the former ad
and thamud tribes 
and before them the people of noah who were even more unjust and insolent 
and he overthrew the subverted cities of sodom and gomorrah 
and then covered them from sight forever 
on which then of your lord s signs do you cast doubt 
this is a warning just like those of former times 
the hour that was to come draws ever nearer 
none but god can avert it 
do you then find these tidings strange 
why do you laugh rather than weep 
will you remain proudly heedless 
prostrate yourselves before god  and worship him alone 
the last hour draws near and the moon is split asunder 
yet  when they see a sign they who deny the truth turn their backs and say   the same old sorcery  
they deny the truth and follow their own whims  every matter has its appointed time 
there has come to them many a tiding wherein there are warnings 
profound in wisdom  but all warnings have been of no avail 
so ignore them on the day when the crier will call out about a horrible event 
with downcast eyes they shall come out of their graves  as if they were locusts milling about
hastening towards the crier those who deny the truth will cry   this is such a hard day  
the people of noah denied the truth before them they belied our messenger saying   he is mad   he was rebuffed 
so he cried out to his lord  saying   i am overcome  so help me  
so we opened the gates of the sky with water pouring down in torrents 
and we caused the earth to burst with gushing springs  so that the waters met for a purpose which had been decreed 
we bore him on an ark which  made of planks and nails 
floated on under our eyes  a vindication of him who had been rejected 
we have left this as a sign  but will anyone take heed 
how terrible then was my punishment and my warning 
we have made it easy to learn lessons from the quran is there anyone who would receive admonition 
the people of ad too rejected the truth how terrible was my punishment and my warning 
we sent a raging wind against them on a day of continuous calamity 
it swept people away as if they were trunks of uprooted palm trees 
how dreadful was my punishment and my warning 
we have made it easy to learn lessons from the quran  is there anyone who would receive admonition 
the tribe of thamud also rejected our warnings 
they said   are we to follow a man from amongst ourselves we would surely then fall into error and madness 
has the divine message been revealed to him alone of all of us no  he is a boastful liar  
 we said to him  tomorrow they shall know who is the boastful liar 
for we are going to send the she camel as a trial for them  so watch them and be patient 
and tell them that the water of the well is to be divided between them  and that each one should drink in turn  
but they called their companion who took a sword and hamstrung her 
how terrible were my punishment and my warnings 
then we sent a single blast against them and they became like dry stubble which has been trampled upon 
indeed  we have made the quran easy to learn lessons from is there anyone who would receive admonition 
the people of lot rejected our warnings 
we sent a sandstorm against them which destroyed them all  except the family of lot  whom we saved at the break of dawn 
as a blessing from us  this is how we reward the thankful 
lot warned them of our punishment  but they disputed the warnings   
they even wanted to seduce his guests    but we blinded them  and said   taste my punishment now that you have scorned my warnings     
and early in the morning the punishment decreed overtook them   
taste my punishment now that you have scorned my warnings 
we have made it easy indeed to learn lessons from the quran is there anyone who would receive admonition 
surely warners came to the people of pharaoh 
they  too  rejected all our signs so we seized them with the seizure of one mighty  omnipotent 
are your people who deny the truth better than those or have you been given immunity in the scriptures 
or do they say   we are a united group  and we are bound to prevail  
the hosts shall soon be routed and they shall be put to flight 
indeed  the hour of doom is their appointed time  and the last hour will be the most severe  and the most bitter 
the evil doers are indeed sunk in error and folly   
on the day when they are dragged into the fire on their faces  it will be said to them   now feel the touch of hell  
we have created everything in due measure 
we command but once  our will is done in the twinkling of an eye 
we have indeed destroyed many a people like you is there anyone who would receive admonition 
all their deeds are recorded in their books 
every action  small or great  is noted down 
the god conscious will find themselves in gardens and rivers 
in the seat of truth with an all powerful sovereign 
the merciful
who taught the quran   
he created man
and he taught him speech 
the sun and the moon move according to a fixed reckoning 
the stars and the trees bend in prostration 
he raised the heavens and set up the measure 
so that you should not transgress the measure 
always measure with justice and do not give short measure 
he has laid out the earth for his creatures 
on it are fruits and palm trees with sheathed clusters of dates  
and grains with their husk and fragrant plants 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
he has created man  from dry ringing clay  like the potter s 
and he created the jinns from a flame of fire 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
he is the lord of the two easts and the lord of the two wests 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
he has set the two oceans in motion  converging together 
between them is a barrier  which they do not overrun 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
pearls and corals come forth from both of them 
which  of your lord s wonders would you deny 
his are the lofty ships  that rear aloft on the sea like mountains 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
all that is on the earth is doomed to perish 
while your lord s own self will remain full of majesty and glory 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
everyone in the heavens and on the earth entreats him every day he manifests himself in a new state 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
soon we shall attend to you    two big groups of jinn and mankind 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
o company of jinn and men  if you have the power to go beyond the realms of the heavens and the earth  pass beyond them  you cannot pass out but with our authority 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
flames of fire and molten brass shall be sent against both of you  and you will not be able to defend yourselves 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
when the sky is rent asunder  and becomes red like red leather 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
for  on that day  neither man nor jinn will be questioned about his sins 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
the guilty shall be recognized by their marks so they shall be seized by their forelocks and their feet 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
this is the hell which the guilty called a lie 
they will go round between its flames and boiling water 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
there are two gardens for one who fears standing before his lord 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
 there will be two gardens with spreading branches 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
in both of them  there are two springs flowing 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
in both of them  there will be two kinds of every fruit 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
they will recline upon carpets lined with rich brocade  and the fruits of both these gardens will be within easy reach 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
therein are maidens of modest gaze  whom neither a man nor a jinn had ever touched before them 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
 there will be maidens as fair as corals and rubies 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
the reward of goodness shall be nothing but goodness 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
besides those two there shall be two other gardens 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
both gardens of the darkest green 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
in both of them live springs gush forth 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
in both of them there will be fruit trees and date palms and pomegranates 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
therein will be maidens chaste and beautiful 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
 there the blessed will live with their pure companions sheltered in pavilions 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
whom neither a man or jinn had ever touched before them 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
 they will live in such a paradise reclining upon green cushions and the finest carpets 
which of your lord s wonders would you deny 
blessed be your lord s name  full of glory and majesty 
when the inevitable event takes place 
and there can be no denying its happening 
some shall be abased and others exalted 
when the earth is shaken violently 
and the mountains are totally shattered and crumble to pieces
and become like scattered dust particles 
 on that day you shall be divided into three groups 
those on the right    how blessed are those on the right 
those on the left    how unlucky are those on the left 
the third to the fore shall be the foremost 
they shall be the nearest to god 
they will dwell in the gardens of bliss 
a large group of the early believers 
and a lesser number from the later generations 
seated on couches wrought in gold and encrusted with precious stones 
reclining on them facing each other 
they will be waited on by ageless youths
carrying goblets and ewers and cups filled with the purest wine 
neither causing headaches  nor intoxication 
along with fruits of their choice 
and the meat of any bird that they may desire 
and fair maidens with large  lustrous eyes
like the pearls in their shells 
shall be their recompense for their deeds 
they will not hear therein any vain or sinful talk 
only the words of peace and tranquillity 
those on the right  how fortunate are those on the right 
they shall recline on high amidst lote trees without thorns
and clustered bananas 
and spreading shade
and flowing water 
and fruits in abundance 
never ending and unrestricted 
on raised couches 
we have created maidens perfectly
and made them virgins 
loving companions  matching in age 
for those on the right 
a large group of the earlier people
and a large group of those of later times 
those on the left  how unfortunate are those on the left 
they will find themselves in scorching wind and scalding water 
and under the shadow of black smoke 
neither cool nor refreshing 
they had been affluent before 
and they persisted obstinately in awful sin 
and they used to say   what  after we have died and become dust and bones  shall we indeed be raised up again 
and also our forefathers  
say   indeed  the earlier ones and the later ones
will indeed be gathered together at a fixed time on an appointed day 
then you  you misguided ones  who deny the truth 
shall eat the fruit of the tree of zaqqum 
and fill your bellies with it 
and shall drink boiling water on top of that 
you shall drink it as the thirsty camels drink  
this shall be their entertainment on the day of judgement 
we have created you  why then do you not accept the truth 
have you thought about the semen that you discharge   
did you create it or did we 
it is we who have ordained death for all of you  and we cannot be prevented
from replacing you by others like yourselves or changing your forms and re creating you in forms that you know nothing of 
you have certainly known the first creation why  then  do you not take heed 
have you thought about what crops you plant 
is it you who cause them to grow or do we 
if we so pleased  we could turn your harvest into chaff then you would start lamenting 
we are ruined 
nay  we are deprived altogether  
have you considered the water that you drink 
is it you who cause it to descend from the clouds  or do we 
if we so pleased  we certainly could make it salty why  then  are you not grateful 
have you thought about the fire that you kindle 
did you produce the tree that serves as fuel or do we 
we have made it to be a reminder and a benefit for the wayfarers 
so glorify the name of your lord  the supreme 
nay  i swear by the setting of the stars   
and  indeed  that is a most mighty oath  if you only knew   
that this is indeed a noble quran 
in a well guarded preserved book 
which none can touch except the purified 
it is a revelation sent down from the lord of the worlds 
how can you regard this discourse with disdain 
do you make its denial your means of livelihood 
why  then  when the soul of the dying man reaches the throat 
and you are at that moment looking on helplessly   
and we are nearer to him than you  although you cannot see us   
why  then  if you are not subject to our command 
do you not cause the soul to return to him if you are truthful in your claim 
but if he the dying person is one of those brought near to god 
then for him there shall be comfort and plenty and a garden of bliss 
and if he is of those who are on the right 
he will be greeted with   peace be to you   by those on the right 
but if he is one of those who rejected the truth and went astray 
he will be welcomed with boiling water 
he will burn in hell 
this is indeed the indubitable truth 
so glorify the name of your lord  the supreme 
everything in the heavens and earth glorifies god    he is the mighty  the wise one 
he has sovereign control over the heavens and the earth he gives life and brings death he has power over all things 
he is the first and the last  the outward and the inward he has knowledge of all things 
it was he who created the heavens and earth in six days periods and then ascended the throne he knows what enters the earth and what comes out of it  what descends from the sky and what ascends to it he is with you wherever you are  he sees all that you do 
he has sovereignty over the heavens and the earth all affairs will return to god 
he causes the night to pass into the day and the day to pass into the night and he knows all that is in the hearts of men 
have faith in god and his messenger and spend in charity from that of which he has made you trustees  those of you who believe and give alms shall be richly rewarded 
what could be your reason for not believing in god  when the messenger calls on you to have faith in your lord and he has already made a covenant with you  if indeed you are true believers 
it is he who sends down to his servant clear revelations  so that he may lead you out of darkness into light god is indeed compassionate and merciful to you 
why should you not spend for the cause of god  when god alone holds the heritage of the heavens and the earth those of you who spent and fought before the victory will be higher in rank than those who spent and fought afterwards yet god has promised you all a good reward he is aware of all that you do 
who will offer god a generous loan he will double it for him and give him a rich reward 
on the day  you prophet shall see the faithful  both men and women  with their light streaming out before them and on their right hands  and you shall hear a voice saying to them   glad tidings for you today  you shall enter gardens with rivers flowing through them wherein you shall forever dwell that is the supreme triumph  
on that day  the hypocrites  both men and women  will say to the faithful   wait a while for us  so that we may have some of your light   they will be told   turn back and look for a light elsewhere   a wall will then be raised between them it will have a gate on the inside of which will be grace and mercy and on the outside of which will be punishment 
the hypocrites will call out to the faithful   were we not on your side   they will reply   yes  but you gave in to temptation  you wavered and doubted and were deceived by your wishful thinking until god s will was done  then the deceiver satan misled you about god  
so this day no ransom can be taken from you nor from those who were bent on denying the truth your home is the fire  that is your companion  and a hapless journey s end 
has the time not come for the faithful when their hearts in all humility should engage in the remembrance of god and of the revelation of truth  so that they should not become like those who were given the book before them  whose hearts with the passage of time became hardened and many of whom were disobedient 
remember that god brings the earth back to life after its death we have made our signs clear to you  so that you may fully understand 
alms givers  both men and women  who give a generous loan to god  shall have it multiplied and shall have an honourable reward 
those who believe in god and his messengers are the truthful ones and the witnesses in the sight of their lord they shall have their reward and their light but those who are bent on denying the truth and reject our signs shall be destined for hell 
never forget that the life of this world is only a game and a passing delight  a show  and mutual boasting and trying to outrival each other in riches and children it is like the growth of vegetation after the rain  which delights the planter  but which then withers away  turns yellow and becomes worthless stubble in the life to come there will be a terrible punishment  or god s forgiveness and approval  the life of this world is nothing but means of deception 
vie with one another for your lord s forgiveness and for a paradise as vast as heaven and earth  which has been made ready for those who believe in god and his messengers such is god s grace he bestows it upon whoever he pleases there is no limit to god s bounty 
no misfortune can affect the earth or your own selves without its first having been recorded in a book  before we bring it into being that is easy for god to do 
so that you may not grieve for what has escaped you  nor be exultant over what you have gained god loves neither the conceited nor the boastful 
nor those who  being miserly themselves  urge others to be miserly he who turns his back should remember that god alone is self sufficient and worthy of all praise 
we sent our messengers with evidence and  with them  we sent down the book and the scales of justice  so that men might act in all fairness we sent down iron with its great inherent strength and its many benefits for mankind  so that god might know who would stand up for god  though unseen  and his messengers god is powerful  and almighty 
we sent forth noah and abraham and bestowed upon their offspring prophethood and the book some of them were rightly guided  but many others were transgressors 
then  in their wake  we followed them up with others of our messengers and after them jesus  son of mary we gave him the gospel and imbued the hearts of those who followed him with compassion and mercy but we did not prescribe monasticism for them  that was their own innovation by which they sought to please god but then  they did not observe it in the way that it should have been observed so we rewarded only those who were truly faithful  for many of them were disobedient 
believers  fear god and believe in his messenger he will show you mercy in double measure and will provide a light for you to walk in god will grant you forgiveness he is forgiving and merciful 
the people of the book should know that they have no power whatsoever over god s grace his grace is entirely in his hand and he bestows it upon whoever he wills god is truly infinite in his bounty 
god has indeed heard the words of the woman who pleads with you about her husband and lays her complaint before god  god hears what the two of you have to say god is all hearing  all seeing 
those who separate themselves from their wives by pronouncing   to me you are like my mother s back   must concede that they are not their mothers  none are their mothers except those who gave birth to them    surely they utter an evil word and a lie god is pardoning  forgiving 
those who put away their wives by equating them with their mothers  and then wish to go back on what they have said  must set free a slave before the couple may touch one another again this is what you are exhorted to do god is fully aware of what you do 
and anyone who does not have the means must fast for two consecutive months before they touch each other  and who is not able to do that must feed sixty needy people that is to affirm your faith in god and his messenger these are the limits set by god those who deny the truth shall have a painful punishment 
those who oppose god and his messenger will be humiliated  as were their predecessors we have sent down clear revelations a humiliating punishment awaits those who deny the truth 
on the day god raises them all up from the dead  he will make them understand what they have done god has taken everything into account  even though they have forgotten  for god is a witness to all things 
do you not see that god knows all that is in the heavens and on the earth there is not a secret consultation between three  but he makes the fourth among them    nor between five but he makes the sixth    nor between fewer nor more  but he is in their midst  wherever they may be  in the end he will tell them the truth about their conduct  on the day of judgement for god has full knowledge of all things 
have you not seen how those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels yet revert to that which they were forbidden to do and they conspire to indulge in wrongdoing  aggressive behaviour and disobedience to the messenger when they come to you  they greet you  but not in the words god would use  and inwardly they wonder   why does god not punish us for what we say   hell will be a fitting punishment for them  they will burn in its flames    a wretched fate 
believers  when you confer together in private  do not confer in support of sin and transgression and disobedience to the messenger  but confer for the promotion of virtue and righteousness fear god  before whom you shall all be gathered 
conspiracy for evil purposes is the work of satan  by which he means to bring grief to believers but he cannot harm them in the least  unless it be by god s leave let the believers put their trust in god 
believers  if you are told to make room for one another in your assemblies  then do so  and god will make room for you  and if you are told to rise up  do so  god will raise in rank those of you who believe and those who have been given knowledge  he is fully aware of all that you do 
believers  when you come to consult the messenger privately  give something in charity beforehand that is best for you and most conducive to purity but if you cannot find anything to give  know that god is forgiving and merciful 
do you fear that you will not be able to give in charity before your consultation then if you are unable to do so  know that god has turned to you in his mercy  then observe your prayers and pay the prescribed alms and obey god and his messenger god is aware of all that you do 
do you not see those who have befriended a people who have brought down upon themselves the wrath of god they are neither with you nor with them and they wittingly swear to falsehood 
god has prepared a severe punishment for them  surely what they have done is evil 
they have used their oaths to cover up their misdeeds and have thus turned others away from the path of god a humiliating punishment awaits them 
neither their wealth nor their children will be of the least avail in protecting them against god    they are the inheritors of hell  and there they shall remain forever 
on the day god raises them all up from the dead  they will swear to him just as they have sworn to you  thinking that they are on firm ground but surely they are liars 
satan has got the better of them and has caused them to forget the remembrance of god they have gone over to the side of the devil  and it is as the devil s partisans that they shall be the losers 
those who oppose god and his messenger will on judgement day be among the most abased 
god has decreed   i and my messengers shall most certainly prevail   truly god is powerful and almighty 
you will find no believers in god and the last day consorting with those who oppose god and his messenger  even though they be their fathers  their sons  their brothers or their close relatives he has engraved faith on their very hearts and has strengthened them with a spirit of his own he will usher them into gardens through which rivers flow where they shall dwell forever god is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with him they are god s party god s party shall surely enter into a state of bliss 
everything in the heavens and on the earth glorifies god he is the almighty  the all wise 
it was he who turned those people of the book who denied the truth out of their homes in the first banishment you never thought they would go  and they thought their strongholds would protect them against god but god came upon them from where they least expected and cast such terror into their hearts that their houses were pulled down by their own hands as well as by the hands of the believers learn a lesson  then  you who are endowed with insight 
if god had not prescribed exile for them  he would surely have punished them in this world but they shall have the torment of fire in the hereafter 
because they set themselves against god and his messenger  god is stern in his punishment of anyone who sets himself against him 
whatever palm trees you cut down or left standing on their roots  it was by god s leave  so that he might disgrace the transgressors 
whatever god has given to his messenger as spoils from them is by his grace  you spurred neither horse nor camel for them  but god gives power to his messengers over anyone he wills god has power over all things   
whatever gains god has assigned to his messenger from the inhabitants of the town is for god and for the messenger and for his kinsfolk and for orphans and the needy and the wayfarer  so that they may not become the property of those of you who are rich whatever the messenger gives you  take it  and whatever he forbids you  abstain from it fear god  surely  god is severe in retribution 
it is for the poor refugees who were driven from their homes and possessions  desiring the favour and the pleasure of god and supporting god and his messenger such people are the truthful 
those who were already settled in the city madinah and firmly rooted in faith  love those who migrated to them for refuge  and harbour no desire in their hearts for what has been given to the latter they give them preference over themselves  even if they too are needy  those who are saved from their own souls greed are truly successful 
those who came into the faith after them say   our lord  forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in the faith and leave no malice in our hearts towards those who believe lord  you are indeed compassionate and merciful  
have you not seen those who act hypocritically they say to their disbelieving companions from among the people of the book   if you are driven out we shall surely go out with you  and we shall never listen to anyone against you  and if war is waged against you  we shall help you   god bears witness that they are indeed liars 
if they are driven out  they will not go with them  nor  if they are attacked  will they help them indeed  if they go to their help  they will turn their backs in flight  and then they will not be helped 
they are more in dread of you than of god  because they are people devoid of understanding 
they will never fight against you in a body except from within fortified strongholds or from behind walls there is much hostility between them you think they are united  but their hearts are divided  because they are a people devoid of reason 
like those who went just before them  they have tasted the evil consequences of their doings and they shall have a painful punishment 
they are like satan  who says to man   deny the truth   but when man denied the truth  said   i disown you  i fear god  the lord of the universe  
thus  in the end  both will find themselves in the fire  therein to abide  that is the reward of evil doers 
believers  fear god  and let every soul look to what it lays up for the future fear god  god is aware of what you do 
do not be like those who forgot god  so that he caused them to forget their own souls their own true interests it is they who are the rebellious ones 
the people of the fire and the people of paradise are not equal the people of paradise are the victorious ones 
had we sent down this quran on a mountain  you would certainly have seen it falling down and splitting asunder  because of the fear of god we set forth these parables to men so that they may reflect 
he is god  there is no deity save him he knows the unseen and the visible he is the compassionate  the merciful 
he is god  there is no deity save him  the sovereign  the most pure  the source of peace  the granter of security  the protector  the mighty  the subduer  the supreme  glory be to god  who is far above what they associate with him 
he is god    the creator  the originator  the giver of form his are the most excellent names everything in the heavens and earth declares his glory he is the mighty  the wise one 
believers  do not offer friendship to those who are enemies of mine and of yours would you show them affection when they have rejected the truth you have received  when they have driven you and the messenger out simply because you believe in god  your lord if you have left your homes to strive for my cause and out of a desire to seek my goodwill  how can you secretly offer them friendship i know all that you conceal and all that you reveal whoever of you does this will surely stray from the right path 
if they gain ascendancy over you  they will behave towards you as enemies and stretch out their hands as well as their tongues with evil intent  they long for you to renounce your faith 
neither your relatives nor your children will be of any help to you on the day of resurrection he will judge between you  and god sees all that you do 
indeed you have an excellent example in abraham and those who followed him  when they said to their people   we disown you and whatever you worship besides god we renounce you enmity and hatred shall endure between us and you  until you believe in the one god   the exception was when abraham said to his father   i shall indeed pray for god s forgiveness for you  although i do not have it in my power to obtain anything from god on your behalf   they prayed   o our lord  in you we have placed our trust and to you we turn in repentance and to you is the final return 
our lord  do not make us a prey for those who deny the truth  and forgive us our lord for you alone are the mighty  the wise one  
surely  there is a good example in them for you  for those who place their hopes in god and the last day whoever turns away will surely learn that god is self sufficient and worthy of all praise 
it may well be that god will create goodwill between you and those of them with whom you are now at enmity    for god is all powerful  most forgiving and merciful 
he does not forbid you to deal kindly and justly with anyone who has not fought you on account of your faith or driven you out of your homes  god loves the just 
god only forbids you to make friends with those who have fought against you on account of your faith and driven you out of your homes or helped others to do so any of you who turn towards them in friendship will truly be transgressors 
believers  when believing women come to you as refugees  submit them to a test their faith is best known to god then if you find them to be true believers  do not send them back to those who deny the truth these women are not lawful for them  nor are those who deny the truth lawful for these women but hand back to those who deny the truth the dowers they gave them  nor is it an offence for you to marry such women  provided you give them their dowers do not maintain your marriages with those women who deny the truth  demand repayment of the dowers you have given them and let the disbelievers ask for the return of what they have spent such is god s judgement  he judges with justice between you god is all knowing and all wise 
if any of your wives desert you to go over to the disbelievers  and you subsequently have your turn  by the coming over of a woman from the other side give to those who have been deserted by their wives the equivalent of the dowers they gave them fear god in whom you believe 
o prophet  when believing women come to you and pledge themselves not to associate in worship any other thing with god  not to steal or commit adultery or kill their children or indulge in slander  intentionally inventing falsehoods  and not to disobey you in that which is right  then accept their pledge of allegiance and pray to god to forgive them their sins  for god is forgiving and merciful 
believers  do not make friends with those who have incurred the wrath of god such men are indeed bereft of all hope of a life to come  just as those who deny the truth lying in their graves are bereft of all hopes 
everything in the heavens and earth glorifies god    he is the almighty  the wise 
believers  why do you say one thing and do another 
it is most hateful to god that you do not practise what you preach 
surely  god loves those who fight for his cause in ranks  as if they were a solid cemented structure 
remember when moses said to his people   o my people  why do you cause me grief when you know that i am god s messenger to you   when they wavered  god let their hearts waver too god does not guide transgressors 
remember when jesus  son of mary  said   o children of israel  i am sent to you by god  confirming the torah that came before me and bringing good news of a messenger to follow me  whose name will be ahmad   yet when he came to them with clear signs  they said   this is merely sorcery  
who could be more wicked than one who invents lies about god when called to submit to him god does not guide the wrongdoers 
they wish to put his light out with their mouths but he will perfect his light  much as those who deny the truth may dislike it 
it is he who has sent his messenger with guidance and the true religion  so that he may cause it to prevail over all religions  however much the polytheists may dislike it 
believers  shall i guide you to a profitable course that will save you from a painful punishment 
you should believe in god and his messenger  and strive for god s cause with your possessions and your lives that will be better for you  if you only knew   
and he will forgive you your sins and admit you into gardens with rivers flowing under them he will lodge you in fine dwellings in the gardens of eternity  that is indeed the supreme achievement 
he will give you another blessing which you desire  help from god and imminent victory give good tidings o muhammad to believers 
believers  be god s helpers  as jesus  son of mary  said to the disciples   who will be my helpers in the cause of god   the disciples said   we shall be god s helpers   some of the children of israel believed in him and some denied the truth  we supported the believers against their enemies and they triumphed over them 
whatever is in the heavens and on the earth glorifies god  the sovereign lord  the holy one  the mighty  the wise 
it is he who has raised among the unlettered people a messenger from among themselves who recites his revelations to them  and purifies them  and teaches them the book and wisdom  for they had formerly been clearly misguided   
and to others also  from among them  who have not yet joined them he is the mighty  the wise one 
that is god s grace  he bestows it on whom he pleases  for god is limitless in his grace 
those who were charged with bearing the torah  but did not do so are like an ass carrying a load of books how unfortunate are those who belie the sign of god god does not guide the wrongdoers 
say   you who are jews  if you claim that you are favoured by god out of all people  then long for death  if you are truthful  
they will never wish for it  because of what their hands have sent forward god has full knowledge of evil doers 
so say   the death you run away from will certainly meet you  and thereafter you will be brought back to the knower of the unseen and the seen  and he will declare to you what you have done  
believers  when the call to prayer is made on the day of congregation  hasten to the remembrance of god  and leave all worldly commerce  this is for your own good  if you but knew it 
when the prayer is ended  disperse in the land and seek to obtain something of god s bounty  and remember god much  so that you may prosper 
yet when they see some merchandise or entertainment  they break away to go to it and leave you standing say   that which god has in store is far better than any merchandise or entertainment   god is the most munificent giver 
when the hypocrites come to you  they say   we bear witness that you are indeed the messenger of god   god knows that you are indeed his messenger  but god bears witness that the hypocrites are surely liars   
they use their oaths as a cover and thus they bar others from god s way  what they have been doing is truly evil   
that is because they believed and then rejected their faith  their hearts are sealed up  so that they are devoid of understanding 
when you see them  their outward appearance pleases you  when they speak  you listen to what they say but they are like propped up blocks of timber they think that every shout is directed against them they are the real enemies  so beware of them the curse of god be upon them  how they turn away 
when they are told   come  the messenger of god will ask forgiveness for you   they turn their heads away and you see them walking away arrogantly 
it makes no difference whether you ask forgiveness for them or not god will not forgive them  god does not guide such rebellious people 
they are the ones who say   give nothing to those who follow god s messenger  until they abandon him   but the treasures of the heavens and the earth belong to god  though the hypocrites do not understand this
 and they say   indeed  when we return to madinah  we the ones most worthy of honour  will surely drive out from there the contemptible ones   referring to poor muslims however  all honour belongs to god  and to his messenger and those who believe in god   but of this the hypocrites are not aware 
o believers  do not let your wealth or your children distract you from remembrance of god those who do so will be the losers 
and spend out of what we have provided you with before death comes to one of you and he says   my lord  if only you would grant me respite for a little while  then i would give alms and be among the righteous  
but god will not grant a reprieve to a soul when its appointed time has come  god is well aware of what you do 
all that is in the heavens and on the earth extols the glory of god to him belongs the kingdom and to him all praise is due he has power over all things 
it was he who created you  and some of you are those who deny this truth  and some who believe in it god sees everything you do 
he created the heavens and the earth for a purpose he formed you and gave you the best of forms to him you shall all return 
he knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth he knows all that you conceal and all that you reveal god is aware of what is in your hearts 
have you not heard about those who denied the truth before you and tasted the evil consequences of their conduct they will have a painful punishment 
that was because their messengers came to them with clear signs  but they replied   shall mortals be our guides   and so they rejected the truth and turned away god has no need of such people  god is self sufficient and worthy of all praise 
those who deny the truth claim that they will never be raised up again say   by my lord  most surely you will be raised up again and then you will be told of all that you have done  and that is easy enough for god  
believe then in god and his messenger  and in the light which we have sent down god is fully aware of all that you do 
when he shall gather you all for the day of gathering  that will be the day of loss and gain  and whoever believes in god and does good deeds shall be forgiven their sins and admitted to gardens through which rivers flow  where they shall dwell forever that is the supreme triumph 
but those who denied the truth and rejected our signs shall be the inmates of the fire  there to remain    what an evil destination 
no affliction can befall man but by god s permission    he guides the hearts of those who believe in him  god has knowledge of all things   
obey god and obey the messenger  but if you turn away  remember that our messenger is only responsible for clearly conveying the message 
god  there is no god but he  so let the faithful put their trust in him 
believers  even among your wives and your children you have enemies  so beware of them but if you overlook their offences and forgive and pardon them  then surely  god is most forgiving and merciful 
your wealth and your children are only a trial  god s reward is great 
so be mindful of god as best as you can  and listen  and obey  and spend in charity  it is for your own good those who guard themselves against their own greed will surely prosper 
if you give a good loan to god  he will multiply it for you and forgive you  for god is appreciative and forbearing 
god is the knower of the unseen and the seen  he is the almighty  the wise one 
o prophet  when any of you divorce your wives  divorce them during their period of purity and calculate the period carefully  be mindful of god  your lord do not drive them out of their homes  nor should they themselves leave  unless they become openly guilty of immoral conduct these are the bounds set by god he who transgresses god s bounds wrongs his own soul you never know  after that  god may well bring about some new situation 
and when their waiting term is ended  either keep them honourably or part with them in honour call to witness two reliable men from among you and bear true witness for god this is an admonishment for those who believe in god and the last day to one who fears god  he will grant a way out of his difficulties  
and god will provide for him from an unexpected source  god suffices for anyone who puts his trust in him god will surely bring about what he decrees he has set a measure for all things 
in the case of those of your wives who have passed the age of menstruation  if you have any doubt  know that their waiting period is three months  and that will apply likewise to those who have not yet menstruated  the waiting period of those who are pregnant will be until they deliver their burden give birth god makes things easy for those who are mindful of him 
such is the commandment which god has revealed to you he who fears god shall be forgiven his sins and richly rewarded 
let the women who are undergoing a waiting period live in the same manner as you live yourselves  in accordance with your means  and do not harass them in order to make their lives difficult if they are pregnant  maintain them until they give birth  if they suckle your infants  pay them for it  discuss things among yourselves in all decency    if you cannot bear with each other  let another woman suckle for you   
let the man of means spend in accordance with his means  and let him whose resources are restricted  spend in accordance with what god has given him god does not burden any person with more than he has given him god will soon bring about ease after hardship 
how many a town rebelled against the commands of its lord and his messengers and we called them sternly to account and punished them severely 
so they tasted the evil consequences of their conduct and the result of their conduct was ruin 
god has prepared a severe punishment for them so  fear god  o men of understanding  who have believed god has sent down to you a reminder
and a messenger who conveys to you god s clear messages  so that he might lead those  who believe and do good deeds  out of darkness into light god will admit those who believe in him and do good deeds into gardens with rivers flowing through them  where they will remain forever god has indeed made excellent provision for them 
it is god who created the seven heavens and the same number of earths his commandment descends among them  so that you may know that god has power over all things  and that he encompasses all things with his knowledge 
prophet  why in your desire to please your wives  do you impose a ban on what god has made lawful to you god is forgiving and merciful 
god has already ordained that you be absolved of such oaths god is your patron he is the all knowing  the wise one 
the prophet once told one of his wives something in confidence she did not keep it secret and god informed him of this  he made known a part of it  and avoided mentioning part of it when he spoke to his wife of this  she asked him who had told him about it he replied   the all knowing  the all aware one  
if only both of you would turn to god in repentance    and your hearts are already so inclined but if you uphold each other against him  then surely god is his protector  and gabriel and the righteous among the believers  and the angels too are his helpers 
were he to divorce you  his lord might well replace you with better wives    submissive to god   believing  pious  penitent  devout in worship  given to fasting    previously married and virgins 
believers  safeguard yourselves and your families from a fire fuelled by people and stones  and watched over by angels  stern and strong  angels who never disobey god s commands to them  but promptly do as they are commanded 
you who are bent on denying the truth  make no excuses today  you are only being rewarded according to your deeds 
believers  turn to god in sincere repentance your lord may well forgive your bad deeds and admit you into gardens watered by running streams  on a day when god will not abase the prophet and those who have believed with him their light will shine out ahead of them and on their right  and they will say   lord perfect our light for us  and forgive us  you have power over all things  
prophet  exert yourself to the utmost against those who deny the truth and the hypocrites deal severely with them hell will be their abode    a vile destination 
as an example to those who are bent on denying the truth  god cited the wife of noah and the wife of lot  who were married to two of our righteous servants  but who betrayed them so they could not help them against god  and they were told   enter the fire along with all the others  
to the believers god has given the example of pharaoh s wife who said   my lord  build me a house in nearness to you in paradise and save me from pharaoh and his misdeeds save me from all evil doers  
 god gave another example in the story of mary  imran s daughter  who preserved her chastity and we breathed our spirit into her  she testified to the words of her lord and his scriptures  and was truly devout 
blessed is he in whose hand is the kingdom  he has power over all things 
he created death and life so that he might test you  and find out which of you is best in conduct he is the mighty  the most forgiving one 
he created seven heavens one above the other in layers you will not find any flaw in the creation of the gracious one then look once again  can you see any flaw 
then look again and again your gaze will come back to you confused and exhausted 
we have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps  and we have made them for driving away devils for them we have prepared the punishment of the blazing fire 
those who are bent on blaspheming against their lord will have the punishment of hell  an evil destination 
when they are cast into it  they will hear its roaring as it boils up 
as though bursting with rage each time a group is cast into it  its keepers will ask them   did no warner come to you  
they will say   of course  a warner did come to us  but we belied him and we said  god has revealed nothing  you are in gross error  
they will say   if we had only listened or understood  we should not now be among the inmates of hell  
and thus they will confess their sin  far from god s mercy are the inmates of hell 
as for those who fear their lord in the unseen will have forgiveness and a rich reward 
whether you speak in secret or aloud  he knows what is in every heart 
how could he who created not know his own creation  when he alone is the most subtle in his wisdom and the all aware 
it is he who has made the earth subservient to you  so traverse its regions and eat its provisions to him you shall all be resurrected 
do you feel secure that he who is in heaven will not cause the earth to sink beneath you and then begin to quake 
do you feel secure that the one in heaven will not send against you a whirlwind to pelt you with stones  so that you will know how true my warning was 
those who went before them belied the truth   then how great was my rejection of them 
do they not see the birds above them spreading and closing their wings none save the merciful sustains them surely  he observes all things 
who is there to defend you like an army  besides the lord of mercy those who deny the truth are in deception 
who can provide for you  if he withholds his provision yet they obstinately persist in rebellion and avoidance of the truth 
is he who walks grovelling upon his face better guided  or he who walks upright upon a straight path 
say   it is he who brought you into being  and made ears and eyes and hearts for you  yet you are seldom grateful  
say   it is he who has scattered you on the earth  and it is to him that you shall all be gathered on the day of resurrection 
they ask   when will this promise be fulfilled  if you are truthful  
say   god alone has knowledge of that  and i am only a plain warner  
but when they see it drawing near  the faces of those who deny the truth will turn gloomy and they will be told   this is what you were calling for  
say   have you thought  if god destroys me and those who are with me  or treats us mercifully  then who will protect those who deny the truth from a painful chastisement  
say   he is the most gracious  we believe in him and we put our trust in him you will soon come to know who is in evident error  
say   have you considered if your water were to sink into the ground  who could then bring you flowing water  
nun by the pen  and all that they write 
by the grace of your lord  you are not a mad man 
most surely  you will have a never ending reward 
for you are truly of a sublime character 
soon you will see  as will they 
which of you is a prey to madness 
your lord knows best who has fallen by the wayside  and who has remained on the true path 
do not give in to the deniers of truth 
they want you to make concessions to them and then they will reciprocate 
do not yield to any contemptible swearer of oaths 
or to any defamer or one who spreads slander 
or to one who places obstacles in the way of good being done or to the wicked transgressor 
who is ignoble and besides all that  base born 
just because he has wealth and sons 
when our revelations are recited to him  he says   these are just ancient fables  
soon we will brand him on the nose 
we have tried them as we tried the owners of a certain orchard  who vowed to harvest all its fruits the next morning 
without saying   if it be god s will  
a calamity from your lord befell the orchard as they slept 
and by morning it lay as if it had already been harvested  a barren land 
so they called out to each other at the break of dawn 
saying   be quick to reach your orchard  if you want to gather all your fruits  
so they went off  whispering to one another 
be sure to stop any poor person from entering the orchard today 
they set out early in the morning  thinking they had the power to prevent 
but when they saw it  they said   we must have lost our way 
indeed  we are utterly ruined  
the more upright of the two said   did i not bid you to glorify god  
they said   glory be to god  our lord we have surely done wrong  
then they began to heap reproaches on each other 
they said   alas for us  our behaviour was beyond the pale 
may be our lord will give us a better orchard in its stead  we turn to him  
such was their punishment  in this life but the punishment of the life to come is much more severe  if only they knew it 
those who are mindful of their lord will be rewarded with gardens of bliss 
should we treat the true believers and the wrongdoers alike 
what ails you how ill you judge 
have you a scripture that tells you
that you will be granted whatever you choose 
or do you have our solemn oaths  binding upon us till the day of resurrection  that you shall have whatever you yourselves decide 
ask them  which of them will vouch for that 
or have they other partners besides god let them bring forth their other partners  if what they say be true 
on the day when the truth shall be laid bare  they will be called upon to prostrate themselves  but they will not be able to do so 
their eyes will be cast down and they will be covered in shame  they were bidden to prostrate themselves  when they were safe and sound but they did not obey 
so leave to me those who reject this message we shall lead them step by step to their ruin  in ways beyond their ken 
i shall grant them some respite  for my plan is powerful 
do you demand some recompense from them that would weigh them down with debt 
is the unseen within their grasp so that they write it down 
wait patiently for your lord s judgement  do not be like the man who  having been swallowed by a whale  called out in distress 
had his lord s grace not been bestowed upon him  he would have been cast away in disgrace upon that desolate shore 
but his lord chose him for his own and made him one of the righteous 
when those who deny the truth hear the admonition  they would almost cause you to stumble with their evil eyes  and they say   he is certainly mad  
yet it is purely an admonition to mankind 
the inevitable hour 
what is the inevitable hour 
and what will make you realize what the inevitable hour is 
the tribes of thamud and ad denied that disaster would strike them 
the thamud were destroyed by a terrible storm of thunder and lightning 
and the ad were destroyed by a furious wind
which god let loose against them for seven nights and eight days unremittingly  so that you could have seen its people lying prostrate as though they were the hollow trunks of palm trees which had fallen down 
do you see any vestige left of them now 
pharoah and those before him and the inhabitants of the overthrown cities persistently committed grave sins 
they defied their lord s messenger  so he seized them with an ever tightening grip 
but we bore you away in the ark  when the waters rose high 
so that we might make it a reminder for you and so that attentive ears might retain it 
when a single blast is blown on the trumpet 
and the earth and the mountains are lifted up and then crushed with a single blow 
on that day the great event will come to pass 
and the sky will be rent asunder  for on that day it will be so frail 
the angels will appear by its sides and  on that day  eight angels will bear your lord s throne above them 
on that day you will be brought to judgement and none of your secrets will remain hidden 
then he who is given his record in his right hand will exclaim   here is my record  read it 
surely  i knew that i should meet my reckoning  
so he will live in a state of bliss
in a lofty garden 
with clusters of fruit within easy reach 
we shall say to him   eat and drink joyfully as a reward for the good deeds you did in days gone by  
but he who is given his record in his left hand will say   if only i had never been given my record
and knew nothing of my reckoning 
how i wish my death had ended all 
my wealth has been of no use to me 
i am bereft of power  
seize him and fetter him 
and then let him enter hell 
then fasten him with a chain seventy cubits long 
for he did not believe in almighty god 
nor did he feel any urge to feed the needy 
so today he has no friend here 
and the only food he has is filth
which no one will eat except the sinners 
but nay  i swear by all that you can see
as well as all that you cannot see 
most surely  this is the word brought by a noble messenger 
it is not the word of a poet    how little you believe    
nor is it the word of a soothsayer    how little you reflect 
it is a revelation sent down by the sustainer of the universe 
if he had invented any lies about us 
we would indeed have seized him by his right hand
and would indeed have cut his life vein 
and none of you could have held us off from him 
and surely it is an admonition to the god fearing 
we know very well that there are some among you who reject our signs   
it will be a source of bitter regret for those who deny the truth   
it is the indubitable truth 
so glorify the name of your lord  the almighty 
a doubter once demanded that punishment be immediately meted out 
to those who deny the truth no power can hinder god
from punishing them he is the lord of the ascending stairways 
by which the angels and the spirit will ascend to him in one day which will last for fifty thousand years 
therefore  o believers behave with seemly patience 
they see it the day of judgement to be far off 
but we see it near at hand 
on that day the heavens shall become like molten brass 
and the mountains will become like tufts of wool 
and no friend will ask about his friend 
though they shall be within sight of each other the guilty one will gladly ransom himself from the torment of that day by sacrificing his own children 
his wife  his brother 
and his kinsfolk who gave him shelter 
and all the people of the earth  if that could deliver him 
but no  there is a raging blaze
stripping away his skin 
and it will claim all those who turned their backs on the true faith and turned away from the truth  
and amassed wealth and hoarded it 
indeed  man is born impatient 
when misfortune touches him he starts lamenting 
and whenever good fortune comes to him  he grows niggardly 
but not so the worshippers
who are steadfast in prayer 
those who give a due share of their wealth
to those who ask for help and to the destitute 
and those who believe in the day of judgement
and are fearful of the punishment of their lord 
for none may ever feel secure from the punishment of their lord 
those who preserve their chastity
except from their spouses and those whom they rightfully possess through wedlock   for which they incur no blame   
but those who go beyond that limit are transgressors 
and those who are faithful to their trusts and to their pledges 
and those who stand by their testimony
and are steadfast in their prayers 
they will be honoured in the gardens of bliss 
but what is the matter with those who deny the truth  that they come hastening towards you
from the right and from the left  in crowds 
does every one of them aspire to be admitted into a garden of delight 
certainly not  they know quite well out of what we created them 
but nay  i call to witness the lord of the easts and the wests  that we have the power
to replace them with others better than them  nothing can prevent us from doing this 
so leave them to indulge in vain idle talk and amuse themselves  until they face the day which they have been promised 
the day when they shall come out of their graves in haste  as if they were racing to a goal 
with downcast eyes and faces distorted in shame  such is the day which they are promised 
we sent noah forth to his people  saying   warn your people before there comes upon them a grievous punishment  
 noah said   my people  i am but a plain warner to you 
that you should worship god alone and be conscious of him pay heed to me 
he will forgive your sins and will grant you respite till an appointed time when the time appointed by god arrives  it cannot be postponed  if you only knew  
he said   my lord  i have called my people night and day
but my pleas have only increased their aversion 
every time i have called to them  so that you might forgive them  they have only thrust their fingers into their ears  covered themselves up with their garments  grown obstinate  and given themselves up to arrogance 
then i called them openly 
and spoke to them in public and in private  
then i said   ask forgiveness of your lord surely he is the most forgiving 
he will send down abundant rain from the sky for you 
increase your wealth and sons  and grant you gardens and waterways 
what is the matter with you that you deny the greatness of god 
when he has created you through different stages of existence 
do you not see how god has created the seven heavens one above another 
and made the moon therein a light  and made the sun a lamp 
how god has produced you from the earth and caused you to grow 
how he will then return you to it and bring you forth again 
how god has spread the earth out for you
so that you may walk along its spacious paths  
noah supplicated   lord  they have disobeyed me  and followed those whose wealth and children have only added to their ruin 
and they have hatched a mighty plot 
and they said to their followers    do not ever abandon your deities  abandon neither wadd  nor suwa   and neither yaghuth  nor yauq nor nasr  
they have led many astray  so lead the wrongdoers to further error  
they were drowned and sent to hell for their misdeeds  they found no one to help them against god 
noah prayed   o my lord  do not leave on earth a single one of those who deny the truth   
if you leave any  they will misguide your servants  and they will beget none but sinners and deniers of truth   
lord  forgive me and my parents and every true believer who enters my house  forgive all the believing men and believing women  and bestow no increase upon the wrongdoers except in ruin 
say   it has been revealed to me that a band of the jinn listened to the quran and they said   we have heard a really wonderful recital 
which guides to the right path  so we have believed in it and we will not associate anyone with our lord 
and exalted is the majesty of our lord  he has taken neither a wife nor a son 
and now we know that the foolish among us have been saying outrageous things about god 
we had supposed that men and jinn would never utter a lie against god 
some men used to seek refuge with the jinn in the past  but that only increased their insolence 
they thought  as you did  that god would never raise up anyone from the dead 
we sought to reach heaven  but found it filled with strong guards and flames   
we used to take up a position to listen  but whoever listens now finds a flaming fire lying in wait for him   
we cannot tell if this bodes evil to those who dwell on earth or whether their lord intends to guide them 
some of us are righteous  while others are not  we follow divergent paths 
we have realized that we could never thwart god on earth and that we would never be able to thwart him by flight 
when we heard the call to guidance  we believed in it he who believes in his lord has no fear of loss or of injustice 
some of us are obedient while others are wrongdoers  it is the obedient who have found the right path 
but those who are wrongdoers will become the fuel of hell  
if they had followed the right path  we would have provided them with abundant rain   
so that we may test them by it    whoever turns away from the remembrance of his lord shall be sternly punished 
the mosques are for god s worship    so do not invoke anyone else along with god   
when god s servant stood up to pray to him  they pressed close to him in great numbers  almost stifling him 
say   i call only upon my lord and do not associate anyone else with him  
say   it is not in my power to cause you either harm or good  
say   surely no one can protect me against god  nor can i find besides him any place of refuge 
my duty is only to convey that which i receive from him and his messages   for those who disobey god and his messenger there is the fire of hell  wherein they will abide forever 
when they are confronted by what they have been promised  they will realize who is weaker in helpers and fewer in numbers 
say   i do not know whether what you are promised is imminent  or whether my lord has set for it a far off day 
he alone has knowledge of what is hidden he reveals this to none 
except the messenger whom he has chosen he sends down guardians who walk before them and behind them 
so that he may know that the messengers have delivered the messages of their lord he encompasses all that is with them and he keeps count of all things 
o you who are wrapped up in your mantle 
stand up to pray for much of the night 
it may be half the night or a little less than that
or a little more  but recite the quran slowly and distinctly 
for we are about to send down to you a message of considerable gravity 
surely  getting up at night for worship is the most potent means of subduing the self and most suitable for the word of prayer 
you have by day prolonged occupations with dawah work 
remember the name of your lord  and devote yourself to him wholeheartedly 
he is the lord of the east and the west  there is no deity but him  so take him as your guardian 
bear patiently with what they say  and ignore them politely 
leave it to me to deal with the deniers  who live a life of comfort  and bear with them a little longer 
we have in store for them heavy fetters and a blazing fire 
food that chokes and painful punishment
on the day the earth and mountains shall shake and the mountains crumble into shifting sand dunes 
we have sent a messenger who is a witness over you  just as we sent a messenger to pharoah before you 
but pharoah rebelled against the messenger  so we seized him with a strong  crushing grip 
if you persist in denying the truth how will you escape the day that will turn the children s hair grey 
the day when the heavens will be rent asunder and god s promise shall be fulfilled 
this  surely  is an admonition so let him who will  take the right path to his lord 
your lord knows that you stand up praying for nearly two thirds of the night  or one half of it and sometimes one third of it  as do others among your followers god determines the measure of night and day he knows that you will not be able to do it  so he has turned to you in mercy recite  then  as much of the quran as is easy for you he knows that there will be some among you who may be sick and others who will be travelling throughout the land seeking god s bounty  and yet others who may be fighting for the cause of god so  recite  then as much of it as you are able  and be constant in prayer  and spend in charity  and give to god a goodly loan for whatever good deed you send on before you for your souls  you will find it with god it will be improved and richly rewarded by him seek god s forgiveness  he is most forgiving  most merciful 
o  you  wrapped in your cloak 
arise and give warning 
proclaim the glory of your lord 
purify your garments 
shun uncleanness 
do not bestow a favour in the expectation of receiving more in return 
and for the sake of your lord  be patient 
when the trumpet is sounded 
that day will be a hard and distressing day 
it will not be easy for those who deny the truth 
leave me alone to deal with him whom i have created alone 
and to whom i have granted resources in abundance 
and sons to be by his side 
and whom i have provided with every resource 
and yet  he greedily desires that i give him even more 
by no means  he has been stubbornly hostile to our revelation 
i shall force him to endure a painful uphill climb 
for he thought and he plotted   
and woe to him  how he plotted 
let him be destroyed how he calculated 
then he looked round 
then he frowned and scowled 
and he turned his back and behaved arrogantly
and said   this is nothing but sorcery from the ancients 
this is nothing but the word of a mortal  
soon i will cast him into hell 
what could make you conceive what hell fire is 
it does not allow anyone to live  and neither does it leave anyone to die 
it scorches the skin 
there are nineteen angels in charge of it   
we have appointed only angels to be wardens of the fire we have specified their number only as a trial for those who are bent on denying the truth  so that those who were given the book might gain in certainty  and those who believe might increase in faith    and so that neither those who have been given the scripture nor the believers might have any doubts  and that those sick at heart and those who deny the truth might ask   what does god mean by this parable   in this way  god lets go astray whom he wills  and guides whom he wills and none knows the forces of your lord but he this is but a reminder for man 
no  by the moon 
by the night when it departs 
by the dawn when it lightens 
surely  it is one of the gravest things 
it is a warning to man 
alike to every one of you  who want to go forward or hang back 
every soul is held in pledge against its own deeds 
except those of the right hand
who in their gardens will be enquiring
about the sinners 
what has brought you into the fire of hell 
and they shall reply   we were not among those who prayed 
and we did not feed the poor 
we indulged in vain arguments along with those who indulged in them 
and we denied the day of judgement
until the inevitable end death overtook us  
so no intercession will avail them 
then what is wrong with them that they turn away from admonition 
like frightened donkeys
fleeing from a lion 
indeed  everyone of them desires to have sheets of revelations unfolded before them   
no  they do not fear the hereafter   
but this is truly a reminder 
let him who will take heed 
they will only take heed if god so wills  he is the lord who is worthy to be feared  the lord of forgiveness 
by the day of resurrection 
and by the self reproaching soul 
does man think that we cannot resurrect him and bring his bones together again 
indeed  we have the power to restore his very finger tips 
yet man wants to deny what is ahead of him 
he asks   when is this day of resurrection to be  
but on that day   when mortal sight is confounded 
and the moon is eclipsed 
when the sun and the moon are brought together 
on that day man will ask   where can i escape  
but there is nowhere to take refuge 
on that day  to your lord alone is the recourse 
on that day  man will be told of all that he has sent before and what he has left behind 
indeed  man shall be a witness against himself 
in spite of all the excuses he may offer 
 prophet   do not move your tongue too fast in your attempt to learn this revelation 
we ourself shall see to its collection and recital 
when we have recited it  follow its words attentively 
and then  it will be for us to make its meaning clear 
truly  you love immediate gain
and neglect the hereafter 
some faces will be radiant on that day 
looking towards their lord 
and some faces will on that day be gloomy 
dreading some great affliction 
but when man s soul reaches the throat 
and when it is asked   could any magician save him now   
and he knows that it is the time of parting 
when his legs are brought together when affliction is combined with affliction  
on that day he will be driven towards your lord 
he neither believed nor prayed 
but rejected the truth and turned away 
then he went off to his people  swaggering 
woe to you  o man    yes  woe to you 
again  woe to you  o man    yes  woe to you 
does man  then  think that he is to be left to himself  to go about at will 
was he not once a drop of ejaculated semen 
which then became a leech like clot  then god shaped and fashioned him in due proportion 
fashioning out of him the two sexes  the male and the female 
then is he not able to bring the dead back to life 
was there not a period of time when man was nothing worth mentioning 
we created man from a drop of mingled fluid so that we might try him  we gave him hearing and sight 
we showed him the way  whether he be grateful or ungrateful 
 now  behold  for those who deny the truth  we have prepared chains  iron collars and a blazing fire  but
the righteous shall drink from a cup mixed with the coolness of kafur 
a spring from which god s servants will drink  making it gush forth in branches 
they keep their vows and fear a day the woe of which will spread far and wide 
they give food  despite their love for it  to the poor and orphans and captives 
saying   we feed you for the sake of god alone  we seek neither recompense nor thanks from you 
truly  we fear from our lord a woefully grim day  
therefore  god will ward off from them the woes of that day  and make them find brightness and joy 
and their reward for being patient will be a garden and silk clothing 
reclining upon couches  they will find therein neither the heat of the sun nor bitter  biting cold 
the shading branches of trees will come down low over them  and their clusters of fruit  will hang down where they are the easiest to reach 
vessels of silver and goblets of pure crystal will be passed round among them
and gleaming silver goblets which have been filled to the exact measure 
and they will be given a cup to drink flavoured with ginger 
from a flowing spring called salsabil 
they will be attended by youths who will not age    when you see them you will think them to be like sprinkled pearls   
wherever you look  you will see bliss and a great kingdom 
they will wear green garments of fine silk and rich brocade they will be adorned with silver bracelets and their lord will give them a pure drink 
this is your reward your endeavour is fully acknowledged 
truly  it is we who have revealed to you the quran  a gradual revelation 
so wait patiently for the command of your lord  and do not yield to anyone among them who is sinful or ungrateful 
and glorify your lord morning and evening 
and during the night prostrate ourself before him  and extol his glory for a long part of the night 
those people who are unmindful of god aspire for immediate gains  and put behind them a heavy day 
it was we who created them and made their constitution strong  but if we wish we can replace them with others like them 
this is a reminder let whoever wishes  take the right path to his lord 
but you cannot will it unless god wills to show you that way    god is indeed all knowing and wise   
he admits whoever he will into his grace and has prepared a painful punishment for the evil doers 
by the winds sent forth in swift succession 
and then storming on with a tempest s force 
and the rain spreading winds 
separating one from another 
by those who bring down the reminder 
to excuse some and warn others 
that which you have been promised shall be fulfilled 
when the stars lose their light 
and when the sky is rent asunder 
and when the mountains crumble into dust
and when the messengers are brought together at the appointed time   
for what day has this been appointed 
for the day of decision 
what will explain to you what the day of judgement is 
woe on that day to those who reject the truth 
did we not destroy the earlier peoples 
we will now cause the later ones to follow them 
thus do we deal with the culprits 
woe on that day to those who reject the truth 
did we not create you from a humble fluid 
then placed it in a secure repository the womb  
for an appointed term 
thus we have determined the stages of development and our power to determine is excellent indeed 
woe on that day to those who reject the truth 
have we not made the earth a receptacle 
for the living and the dead 
have we not placed high mountains upon it and given you fresh water to drink 
woe on that day to those who reject the truth 
proceed to that which you denied 
proceed to a shadow rising in three columns 
affording neither shade  nor protection from the flames 
and throwing up sparks as huge as towers
and as bright as a herd of yellow camels 
woe on that day to those who reject the truth 
on that day they will be speechless 
nor shall they be permitted to offer excuses 
woe on that day to those who reject the truth 
this is the day of judgement we have assembled you all together with past generations 
if now you have any strategy  use it against me 
woe on that day to those who reject the truth 
the righteous shall dwell amidst cool shades and fountains 
and shall have fruits such as they desire 
 they will be told    eat and drink with relish in return for what you did in life  
this is how we reward those who do good  
 but woe on that day to those who reject the truth 
eat your fill and enjoy your life for a little while  o you who are lost in sin 
woe on that day to those who reject the truth 
when they are bidden to bow down  they do not bow down 
woe on that day to those who reject the truth 
in which word then  after this  will they believe 
what are they asking each other about 
about the awesome tidings of resurrection 
concerning which they are in disagreement 
but they will soon come to know 
surely  they will soon find out the truth 
have we not spread the earth like a bed 
and raised the mountains like supporting poles 
we created you in pairs 
and gave you repose in sleep 
and the night as a cover 
and made the day for earning a livelihood 
we have built above you seven mighty heavens 
and we have set therein a glowing lamp 
 from the rain clouds we send waters pouring down in abundance 
so that we may bring forth thereby grain and a variety of plants 
and gardens dense with foliage 
surely  the day of judgement has an appointed time 
on that day when the trumpet shall be sounded  you shall come in droves 
and the heaven shall be opened  and become gates 
and the mountains shall be made to vanish  as if they had been a mirage 
surely  hell lies in wait 
a home for the transgressors 
where they shall remain for ages 
and where they will taste neither coolness nor any drink
save boiling water and a stinking fluid   
a fitting requital 
for they never expected to be called to account 
and they rejected outright our signs 
but we have recorded everything in a book 
 so we shall say    taste  then  the fruit of your evil doings  for now we shall bestow on you nothing but more and more suffering  
as for those who are mindful of god  they shall surely triumph 
theirs shall be gardens and vineyards 
and young maidens of equal age 
and overflowing cups 
there they shall not hear any idle talk  or any untruth 
all this will be a recompense  a gift  that will suffice them  from your lord 
the sustainer of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them  the most gracious and none shall have it in their power to raise their voices to him 
on the day when the spirit and the angels stand in ranks  no one will speak  except for those to whom the lord of mercy gives permission  and who will say only what is right 
that day is sure to come  so whoever wishes to  let him take the path that leads towards his lord 
we have warned you of a chastisement which is near at hand  on the day when man shall clearly see what his hands have sent ahead  and when he who has denied the truth shall say   oh  would that i were dust  
by the winds that pluck out vehemently
and those that blow gently 
and by the clouds that swim serenely and
by those that outstrip them suddenly 
and by those who regulate events 
on the day when a violent convulsion will convulse the world  
to be followed by further convulsions  
hearts will be throbbing 
while eyes will be downcast 
they say   what shall we be brought back to life 
even after we have turned into decayed bones  
and they say   that indeed would be a losing return  
but all it will take is a single blast 
and behold  they will all come out in the open 
have you heard the story of moses 
his lord called out to him by the sacred valley of tuwa 
 saying    go to pharaoh  he has exceeded all bounds 
and say  will you reform yourself 
do you want me to guide you to your lord  so that you should fear him  
moses showed him the great sign 
but he denied it and refused the faith 
then he quickly turned his back 
and he summoned all his people 
and proclaimed   i am your supreme lord  
but god seized him and meted out to him the chastisement of both the next world and the present 
surely there is in this a lesson for the god fearing 
 o men  are you more difficult to create than the heaven which he has built 
by raising its vault high and fashioning it flawlessly 
and making its night dark and bringing forth its morning light 
and the earth which he spread out 
after that bringing forth from it its water and its pasture land 
and making the mountains firm 
 all this as a means of sustenance for you and your animals 
when the great over whelming event arrives 
on the day that man remembers what he strove for
and hell is there for all to see 
anyone who has acted arrogantly
and prefers the life of this world 
will find himself in hell 
but one who fears to stand before his lord and restrained himself from base desires 
shall dwell in paradise 
they will ask you prophet about the hour  saying   when it will come to pass   
what have you to do with the mentioning of it 
your lord alone knows when it will come 
you are but a warner for those who fear it 
on the day when they see it  they will feel as if they had tarried in this world for only one evening or one morning 
he frowned and turned away
when the blind man approached him 
for how can you know that he might seek to purify himself 
or take heed and derive benefit from our warning 
as for him who was indifferent 
you eagerly attended to him   
though you are not to be blamed if he would not purify himself   
but as for one who comes to you  eagerly
and in awe of god
you pay him no heed 
indeed  this quran is an admonition 
let him who will  pay heed to it 
it is set down on honoured pages 
exalted and purified 
by the hands of
noble and virtuous scribes 
woe to man  how ungrateful he is 
of what stuff has he created him 
out of a drop of sperm  he creates and proportions him 
he makes his path easy for him 
then he causes him to die and be buried 
then when he pleases  he will bring him back to life 
yet man declines to do his bidding 
let man reflect on the food he eats 
we let the rain pour down in torrents
and then we cleaved the earth asunder 
we make the grain grow out of it 
and grape vines and vegetables 
and olive trees and date palms
and burgeoning enclosed gardens
and fruits and fodder
as provision for you and for your cattle to enjoy 
but when the deafening blast is sounded 
on that day a man shall flee from his own brother 
his mother  his father 
his wife and his sons 
on that day every man among them will have enough concern of his own   
on that day some faces will be beaming 
laughing  and rejoicing 
but some faces will be covered with dust
and overcast with gloom 
those will be ones who denied the truth and were immersed in iniquity 
when the sun is folded up 
and when the stars lose their light 
and when the mountains are moved 
when ten month pregnant camels are left untended 
and when all beasts are gathered together 
and when the seas are set on fire 
when the souls are divided into different classes 
and when the female infant buried alive is asked
for what sin she was killed 
when the records of men s deeds are laid open 
when the sky is unveiled 
and when hell is set ablaze 
when paradise is brought close 
 then each soul shall know what it has put forward 
i swear by the receding stars 
the planets that run their course and set 
and the night that falls 
and the first breath of morning 
truly  this is the word brought by a noble messenger 
endowed with power and held in honour by the lord of the throne   
who is obeyed there and is worthy of trust 
your companion is not one possessed 
he truly beheld him the angel on the clear horizon 
he is not avid of the unseen 
nor is this the word of an outcast devil 
so where are you going 
this is merely a reminder to all mankind 
to every one of you who wishes to tread the straight path 
but you cannot will it unless god  the lord of the universe  so wills it to show you that way 
when the sky is cleft asunder 
and when the stars are scattered 
when the seas overflow 
and when the graves are laid open 
then everyone will know what he has sent ahead  and what he has left behind 
o man  what is it that lures you away from your bountiful sustainer 
who created you  fashioned you and proportioned you 
in whatever form he pleased 
yet you deny the last judgement 
surely  there are guardians watching over you 
noble recorders 
who know all that you do 
the virtuous will dwell in bliss 
whereas the wicked will be in hell 
which they shall enter on the day of judgement 
and from which they will find no escape 
what will make you realize what the day of judgement will be 
again  what will make you realize what the day of judgement will be 
it will be a day when no human being shall be of the least avail to any other human being  god alone will hold command on that day 
woe to those who give short measure 
who demand of other people full measure for themselves 
but when they give by measurement or weight to others  they give them less 
do such people not realize that they will be raised up 
on a fateful day 
the day when mankind will stand before the lord of the universe 
indeed  the record of the wicked is in the sijjin   
and what could make you understand what the sijjin is   
it is a written record 
woe  on that day  to those who reject 
those who deny the day of judgement 
no one denies it except for the evil aggressor 
when our revelations are conveyed to him  he says   fables of the ancients  
no  their own deeds have cast a veil over their hearts 
indeed  on that day a barrier will be set between them and their lord 
then they shall enter the fire of hell 
and they will be told   this is what you were wont to belie  
but  the record of the righteous is preserved in the illiyyin   
and what will make you understand what the illiyyin is   
a written record 
which those angels closest to god will bear witness to 
the virtuous will surely be in bliss 
seated on couches and gazing around in wonder 
you will find in their faces the brightness of bliss 
they will be given a drink of pure wine  sealed 
its seal will be of musk    for this let the aspirants aspire   
a wine tempered with the waters of tasnim 
a spring at which those drawn close to god will drink 
the wicked used to laugh at the believers   
when they passed by them  they would wink at one another 
and when they returned to their own people  they would speak of them jestingly 
and when they saw them  they said scornfully    these men have surely gone astray  
though they were not sent to be their keepers   
so today those who believe shall be able to laugh at those who denied the truth
as they sit on couches  gazing around 
have those who deny the truth not been paid back for their deeds 
when the sky bursts open 
and obeys its lord as it must 
when the earth flattens out 
and casts out all that is within it and becomes empty 
and obeys its lord as it must 
o man  having striven hard towards your lord  you shall meet him 
he who is given his record in his right hand
shall have an easy reckoning
and he shall return to his people  joyfully 
but as for him whose record shall be given to him from behind his back 
he will pray for utter destruction
and he will enter the blazing flame 
he used to be happy with his own people 
for he never thought that he would have to return to god 
but he will indeed  his lord was ever watching him 
i swear by the glow of sunset 
by the night and what it covers 
and the moon when it grows full 
you will progress from stage to stage 
what is wrong with them that they do not believe 
when the quran is read to them  why do they not fall to their knees 
indeed  those who are bent on denying the truth reject it   
god is quite aware of what they are storing in their hearts 
therefore  give them the news of a painful punishment 
but for those who believe and do good works  for them there shall be a never ending reward 
by the sky with its constellations 
and by the promised day 
by the witness and the witnessed 
destroyed were the people of the trench 
the makers of the fuel stoked fire 
they sat by it
to watch what they were doing to the believers 
whom they hated for no other reason than that they believed in god  the almighty  the praiseworthy 
to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth god is witness over all things 
those who persecute the believing men and believing women  and then do not repent  will surely suffer the punishment of hell  and the torment of burning 
but those who believe and do good deeds shall be rewarded with gardens watered by flowing rivers that is the supreme triumph 
the grip of your lord is indeed severe 
it is he who begins and repeats his creation  
and he is the forgiving and loving one 
the lord of the glorious throne 
executor of his own will 
have you not heard the story of the hosts
of pharaoh and thamud 
yet those who deny the truth persist in denial 
god encompasses them from all sides 
it is indeed a glorious quran 
written on a preserved tablet 
by the heavens and that which comes in the night   
and what could make you know what it is that comes in the night 
it is the shining star   
 for no human being has been left unguarded 
let man reflect on what he was created from 
he was created from spurting fluid 
issuing from between the backbone and the breastbone 
he certainly has the power to bring him back to life 
on the day when secrets are disclosed 
 man will have no power  and no helper 
by the heavens  ever revolving 
by the earth cracking open with new growth 
it is surely a decisive utterance 
and is not to be taken lightly 
they are planning a scheme 
and so am i 
so bear with those who deny the truth  and let them be for a little while 
glorify the name of your lord  the most high 
who created all things and gave them due proportions 
who determines the nature of all that exists   and guided it accordingly 
who brings forth green pasture 
then turns it into black stubble 
 o prophet  we shall make you recite the quran so that you will not forget any of it   
except whatever god wills  he knows both what is manifest and what is hidden   
we shall facilitate for you the easy way 
remind  if the reminder can be of benefit 
he who fears god will heed the reminder 
but it will be ignored by the most unfortunate 
who will enter the great fire 
where he will neither die nor live 
he who purifies himself 
who remembers the name of his lord and prays  shall indeed be successful 
but you prefer the life of this world 
although the hereafter is better and more lasting 
this indeed is what is taught in the former scriptures   
the scriptures of abraham and moses 
have you heard about the overwhelming event 
on that day  there shall be downcast faces 
labouring  weary 
they shall enter a burning fire
and will be made to drink from a boiling spring 
they shall have no food but thorns 
which will neither nourish nor satisfy hunger 
some faces on that day will be radiant 
well pleased with the result of their striving 
in a sublime garden 
where they will hear no idle talk 
with a flowing spring 
raised couches 
and goblets set at hand 
cushions ranged 
and carpets spread out 
do they never reflect on the camels and how they were created 
and on the sky  how it is raised aloft 
and on the mountains  how they are firmly set up 
and on the earth  how it is spread out 
so  o prophet exhort them  your task is only to exhort 
you are not their keeper 
but whoever turns back and denies the truth 
will be punished by god with the greatest punishment 
certainly  it is to us that they will return 
then  surely  it is for us to call them to account 
by the dawn 
by the ten nights 
by the even and the odd 
and by the passing night 
is there not in this strong evidence for a man of sense 
have you not heard of how your lord dealt with the tribe of ad 
the people of iram  the city of many pillars 
the like of which has never been created in the land 
and with the thamud  who cut out huge rocks in the valley 
and with pharaoh of the stakes 
all of them committed excesses in their lands 
and caused much corruption in them 
so your lord unleashed on them the scourge of punishment 
for  indeed  your sustainer is ever on the watch 
as for man  when his lord tests him  through honour and blessings  he says   my lord has honoured me  
but when he tests him by straitening his means of livelihood  he says   my lord has disgraced me  
no indeed  but you show no kindness to the orphan 
nor do you urge one another to feed the poor 
and you greedily devour the inheritance of the weak 
and you have a love of wealth which can never be satisfied 
no indeed  when the earth is crushed and ground to dust 
when your lord comes down with the angels  rank upon rank 
and hell is made to appear on that day  then man will be mindful  but what will being mindful then avail him 
he will say   oh  would that i had provided beforehand for my life  
on that day no one will punish as he punishes 
and none can bind with bonds like his 
 but to the righteous  god will say    o soul at peace 
return to your lord  well pleased  well pleasing 
join my servants 
enter my paradise  
i swear by this city   
and you are dwelling in this city   
and by parent and offspring 
that we have created man into a life of toil and trial 
does he think then that no one has power over him 
he says   i have spent enormous wealth  
does he then think that no one sees him 
have we not given him two eyes 
and a tongue  and a pair of lips 
and shown him the two paths 
but he has not attempted the ascent 
what will explain to you what the ascent is 
it is the freeing of a slave 
or the feeding in times of famine
of an orphaned relative
or some needy person in distress 
and to be one of those who believe and urge one another to steadfastness and compassion 
those who do so are the people of the right hand 
and as for those who are bent on denying the truth of our revelations  they are the people of the left hand 
and the fire will close in on them 
by the sun and its rising brightness
and by the moon as it follows it 
and by the day as it reveals its glory
and by the night when it draws a veil over it 
by the sky and how he built it
and by the earth and how he spread it 
by the soul and how he formed it 
then inspired it to understand what was right and wrong for it 
he who purifies it will indeed be successful 
and he who corrupts it is sure to fail 
the thamud tribe rejected the truth because of their arrogance 
when the most wicked man among them rose up 
then the messenger of god said to them   this is god s she camel let her drink  
but they gave him the lie  and hamstrung the she camel so their lord destroyed them for their crime and razed their city to the ground 
he did not fear the consequences 
by the night as it veils the earth in darkness 
and by the day as it appears radiantly 
and by the creation of the male and the female 
o men  you truly strive towards the most diverse ends 
as for one who gives to others and fears god  
and believes in the truth of what is right 
we will pave his way to ease 
but as for one who is miserly and unheeding 
and rejects what is right 
we shall pave his way to hardship 
nor will his wealth profit him when he falls into the pit 
surely  it is for us to provide guidance   
and to us belongs the hereafter as well as the present world   
i have warned you then about a raging fire 
none shall enter it but the most wicked 
who denied the truth   and turned away 
one who fears god shall be kept away from it   
one who gives his wealth to become purified 
and owes no favour to anyone  which is to be repaid 
acting only for the sake of his lord the most high   
and before long he will be well satisfied 
by the glorious morning light 
and by the night when it darkens 
your lord has not forsaken you  nor is he displeased with you 
and the hereafter will indeed be better for you than the present life 
soon you will be gratified with what your lord will give you 
did he not find you orphaned and shelter you 
did he not find you wandering  and give you guidance 
did he not find you in want  and make you free from want 
therefore do not treat the orphan with harshness 
and do not chide the one who asks for help 
but proclaim the blessings of your lord 
have we not lifted up your heart 
and removed your burden
that weighed so heavily on your back  and
have we not given you high renown 
so  surely with every hardship there is ease 
surely  with every hardship there is ease 
so  when you are free  strive hard 
and to your lord turn all your attention 
by the fig and the olive 
and by mount sinai 
and by this secure land 
we have indeed created man in the best of mould 
then we cast him down as the lowest of the low 
except for those who believe and do good deeds    theirs shall be an unending reward 
what then after this  can make you deny the last judgement 
is not god the greatest of the judges 
read  in the name of your lord  who created 
created man from a clot of blood 
read  your lord is the most bountiful one
who taught by the pen 
taught man what he did not know 
yet man behaves arrogantly 
because he thinks himself self sufficient 
truly  all will return to your lord 
have you seen one who prevents
a worshipper from praying 
do you think he is rightly guided 
or enjoins true piety 
do you see how he has denied the truth and turned away from it 
does he not know that god observes all things 
let him beware  if he does not desist  we will drag him by the forelock   
his lying  sinful forelock 
then let him call his associates 
we shall summon the guards of hell 
no indeed  do not obey him  but prostrate yourself and come closer to god 
we sent it quran down on the night of destiny 
and what will make you comprehend what the night of destiny is 
the night of destiny is better than a thousand months 
on that night  the angels and the spirit come down by the permission of their lord with his decrees for all matters 
it is all peace till the break of dawn 
the deniers of truth from among the people of the book and the polytheists would not desist from disbelief until they received clear evidence   
a messenger from god  reciting to them pure scriptures 
containing upright precepts 
those who were given the book did not become divided except after clear evidence was given to them 
they were commanded only to worship god  offering him sincere devotion  to be sincere in their faith  to pray regularly  and to give alms  for that is the right religion 
those of the deniers of truth among the people of the book and the polytheists will dwell forever in hell fire they are the worst of creatures 
truly  those who believe and do good works are the best of creatures 
god has a reward in store for them  gardens of eternity  through which rivers flow  they will dwell therein forever god is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with him thus shall the god fearing be rewarded 
when the earth is shaken with its violent shaking 
when the earth shakes off her burdens 
when man asks   what is happening to her   
on that day it will narrate its account 
for your lord has so directed it 
on that day people will come forward in separate groups to be shown their deeds 
whoever has done the smallest particle of good will see it 
while whoever has done the smallest particle of evil will see it 
by the snorting  panting horses 
striking sparks of fire with their hooves 
as they gallop to make raids at dawn 
and raising clouds of dust 
forcing their way into the midst of the enemy 
surely  man is ungrateful to his lord 
he himself bears witness to that 
surely  he is ardent in his love of wealth 
is he not aware of the time when the contents of the graves will be brought out 
and the hearts contents shall be brought into the open 
surely  on that day  they will know that their lord had full knowledge of them all 
the clatterer 
what is the clatterer 
would that you knew what the clatterer is 
 it is a day when mankind shall be like scattered moths
and the mount ains like tufts of carded wool 
then  the one whose good deeds weigh heavy on the scales 
will have a most pleasing life 
but as for him whose deeds are light on the scales 
the abyss shall be his home 
what will convey to you what this is like 
it is a blazing fire 
greed for more and more distracted you from god 
till you reached the grave 
but you will soon come to know 
but you will soon come to know 
indeed  were you to know the truth with certainty 
you would see the fire of hell 
you would see it with the eye of certainty 
then on that day you shall be questioned about your worldly favours 
i swear by the passage of time 
that man is surely in a state of loss 
except for those who believe and do good deeds and exhort one another to hold fast to the truth  and who exhort one another to stead fastness 
woe to every fault finding back biter 
who amasses wealth  counting it over 
thinking that his wealth will make him live forever 
by no means  he shall surely be cast into the crushing torment 
would that you understood what that crushing torment is like 
it is a fire kindled by god 
reaching right into the hearts of men 
it closes in on them from every side
in towering columns 
have you not seen how your lord dealt with the people of the elephant 
did he not foil their strategy
and send against them flocks of birds 
which pelted them with clay stones 
thus he made them like stubble cropped by cattle 
for the security of the quraysh 
their security in their winter and summer journeys 
so let them worship the lord of this house 
who provided them with food lest they go hungry and saved them from fear 
have you seen one who denies the day of judgement 
who turns away the orphan 
and who does not urge the feeding of the poor 
so woe to those who pray
but whose hearts are not in their prayer 
those who do things only to be seen by others 
who are uncharitable even over very small things 
we have given you abundance 
pray to your lord and sacrifice to him alone 
it is the one who hates you who has been cut off 
say   you who deny the truth 
i do not worship what you worship 
you do not worship what i worship 
i will never worship what you worship 
you will never worship what i worship 
you have your religion and i have mine  
when god s help and victory come 
and you see people entering god s religion in multitudes 
then glorify your lord with his praise and seek his forgiveness he is always ready to accept repentance 
may the hands of abu lahab perish  may he be ruined 
neither his wealth nor his gains will avail him 
he shall soon enter a blazing fire 
and also his wife who carries the fuel 
with a rope of twisted fibre round her neck 
say   he is god  the one 
god  the self sufficient one 
he does not give birth  nor was he born 
and there is nothing like him  
say   i seek refuge in the lord of the daybreak
from the evil of what he has created 
from the evil of darkness as it descends 
from the evil of those who blow on knots
and from the evil of the envier when he envies  
say   i seek refuge in the lord of people 
the king of people 
the god of people 
from the mischief of every sneaking whis perer 
who whispers into the hearts of people 
from jinn and men
