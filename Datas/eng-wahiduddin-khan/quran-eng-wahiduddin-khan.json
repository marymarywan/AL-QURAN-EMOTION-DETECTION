have no fear  nor shall they grieve ","119":"the jews say   the christians have no ground to stand on   and the christians say   the jews have no ground to stand on   yet they both recite the book

speculation ","880":"this is a blessed book which we have revealed  confirming what came before it  so that you may warn the mother of cities makkah and the people around it those who believe in the hereafter do believe in it  and they are ever mindful of their prayers ","881":"who could do greater wrong than someone who invents a lie against god or who says   it has been revealed to me   while nothing has been revealed to him  or someone who says   i will send down the like of what god has sent down  if you could only see the wrongdoers in the throes of death when the angels are stretching out their hands  saying   give up your souls today you will be repaid with a humiliating punishment for saying false things about god and being arrogant about his signs  ","882":"and now you have returned to us  alone as we created you at first  leaving behind all that we gave you nor do we see with you your intercessors  those you claimed were your partners with god the link between you is

the all mighty and the all knowing ","885":"it is he who has set up for you the stars so that you might be guided by them in the midst of the darkness of land and sea we have made the signs clear for people who want to understand ","886":"it is he who first produced you from a single soul  then gave you a place to stay in life and a resting place after death we have made our revelations clear to those who are men of understanding ","887":"it is he who sends down water from the sky with it we produce vegetation of all kinds  out of green foliage  we produce clustered grain  and from the date palm  out of its sheath  we produce bunches of dates hanging low we produce vineyards and olive groves and pomegranates  alike yet different look at their fruit as he causes it to grow and ripen in this are signs for people who believe ","888":"they have set up jinns as associates with god  even though he created them  they have even dared  in their ignorance  to attribute sons and daughters to him hallowed be he and exalted far above what they ascribe to him ","889":"the originator of the heavens and the earth how could he have a son when he has no consort he created everything and is aware

blind  does so to his own loss say   i am not here as your keeper  ","893":"this is how we explain our revelations in various ways    so that they might come to the point of saying   you have read this out to us   and that we might make it clear that this is the truth to those who are eager to know ","894":"follow what has been revealed to you from your lord  there is no deity but him  and ignore the polytheists ","895":"if god had willed  they would not have associated anything with him we did not appoint you over them as their keeper  nor are you their guardian ","896":"do not revile those beings whom they invoke instead of god  lest they  in their hostility  revile god out of ignorance thus to every people we have caused their actions to seem fair to their lord they shall all return  and he will declare to them all that they have done ","897":"they swear a solemn oath by god that if there should come to them a sign  they will believe in it say   signs are granted only by god   how can you tell that if a sign be given to them  they will indeed believe in it ","898":"we will turn away their hearts and eyes from the truth  since they refused to believe in it in the first instance we will let them wander blindly in their insolence ","899":"even if we sent down angels to them  and caused the dead to speak to them  and we gathered together everything in front of them  they would still not believe  unless god had so willed but most of them behave ignorantly ","900":"in like manner we have assigned for every prophet an opponent  satans from among men and jinn  who make evil suggestions to each other by means of specious words in order to deceive    had it been your lord s will  they would not have done so  so leave them alone to their fabrication ","901":"in order that the hearts of those who do not believe in the life to come might incline towards those suggestions and  being pleased  persist in their sinful ways ","902":"should i seek a judge other than god  when it is he who has revealed the book  clearly explained those to whom we gave the book earlier know that it is the truth revealed by your lord therefore  have no doubts ","903":"the word of your lord is perfected in truth and justice none can change his words he is the all hearing  the all knowing ","904":"if you obey the majority of those on earth  they will lead you astray from god s way they follow nothing but conjecture they are only guessing ","905":"your lord knows best who has strayed from his way and he knows best those who are guided ","906":"eat then  only that over which god s name has been pronounced  if you truly believe in his revelations ","907":"why should you not eat what has been consecrated in god s name  when he has already explained to you what he has forbidden you  unless you are compelled by necessity surely  many mislead others by their desires through lack of knowledge but your lord best knows the transgressors ","908":"eschew all sin  open or secret  those who commit sin will receive due punishment for their sins ","909":"and do not eat anything over which god s name has not been pronounced  for that surely is disobedience the devils

walk among people be like him who is in utter darkness from which he can never emerge thus the deeds of those who deny the truth have been made fair seeming to them ","911":"thus we have placed leaders of the wicked in every town to plot therein yet it is only against themselves that they scheme  though they may not perceive it ","912":"when a sign comes to them  they say   we will not believe in it until we are given what god s messengers have been given but god knows best whom to appoint as his messenger humiliation before god and severe torment will befall the evil doers for their scheming ","913":"when god desires to guide someone  he opens his breast to islam  and whoever he wills to let go astray  he causes his breast to be constricted as if he had to climb up to the skies that is how god heaps ignominy upon those who refuse to believe ","914":"this is the straight path leading to your lord we have made the signs clear for thinking men ","915":"they shall dwell in the home of peace with their lord  he will be their protector as a recompense for what they have been doing ","916":"on the day when he gathers them all together  he will say   company of jinn  you

he will say   the fire shall be your home  and there you shall remain forever  except as god wills surely your lord is wise and all knowing ","917":"and in like manner we shall keep the wrongdoers close to others as a punishment for their misdeeds ","918":"company of jinn and mankind  did messengers not come from among you to recite my revelations to you  and warn you of the meeting of this day

for god   so they claim   and  this is for our associate gods   their associate gods share does not reach god  whereas god s share reaches their associate gods how ill they judge ","925":"and in like manner  their associate gods have made killing their children seem fair to many pagans  so that they may ruin them and cause confusion in their religion had god pleased  they would not have done so  so leave them to their false inventions ","926":"they also say   these animals and these crops are forbidden none may eat them except those we permit   so they claim  there are some animals they exempt from labour and some over which they do not pronounce god s name  thus committing a sin against him he will requite them for the falsehoods they invent ","927":"they say   what is in the wombs of such and such cattle is exclusively for our males and is forbidden to our females but if it is stillborn  they may have a share of it   god will soon punish them for their false attribution he is wise  and all knowing ","928":"losers indeed are they who kill their children foolishly and without knowledge and declare as forbidden what god has provided for them as sustenance    a fabrication against god  they have gone astray and have not chosen to be rightly guided ","929":"it is he who has produced gardens  both trellised and untrellised  and date palms and field crops  all varying in taste  and the olive and the pomegranate  both similar and dissimilar eat their fruits when they bear fruit and give away what is due of them on the day of their harvest do not waste anything he does not love the wasteful ","930":"of the cattle there are some for carrying burdens and some for food eat what god has provided for you and do not follow in satan s footsteps  for he is a declared enemy of yours ","931":"god has created four kinds of livestock of either sex  two of sheep and two of goats ask them   is it the two males he has forbidden or the two females or what the wombs of the two females contain tell me on the basis of knowledge  if you are truthful  ","932":"again  of the camels there are two  and of the oxen two ask them   is it the two males he has forbidden  or the two females or what the wombs of the two females contain were you present when god enjoined this on you   who is more unjust than one who  without knowledge  fabricates a lie against god  so that he may lead people astray without knowledge surely  god does not guide the wrongdoers ","933":"say o prophet    in all that has been revealed to me  i do not find a ban on anything to eat  except for carrion  flowing blood and pork  all these being unclean or profane  on which the name of someone other than god has been invoked   but if anyone is forced by necessity  being neither disobedient nor exceeding the limit  then surely your lord is most forgiving and merciful ","934":"we forbade the jews all animals with claws and the fat of sheep and goats and oxen  except what is on their backs and in their intestines and what adheres to their bones that is the penalty we imposed on them for their disobedience and we assuredly are true to our word ","935":"so  if they accuse you of lying  say   the mercy of your lord is all encompassing his punishment cannot be averted from sinful men  ","936":"those who associate partners with god will surely say   had god pleased  neither we nor our fathers would have served other gods besides him  nor would we have made anything unlawful   likewise those who lived before them argued falsely until they came to taste our punishment  say   have you any knowledge if so  produce it before us you follow nothing but conjecture you are merely guessing  ","937":"say   god alone has the conclusive proof if he had willed  he could have guided every one of you  ","938":"say   come  bring your witnesses  who can testify that god forbade all this   if they bear witness falsely   do not bear witness with them  nor yield to the wishes of those who deny our signs  nor of those who do not believe in the life to come and set up others as equals with their lord ","939":"say   come  i will tell you what your lord has really forbidden you  do not associate anything with him  be good to your parents  and do not kill your children for fear of poverty  we shall provide sustenance for you as well as for them  refrain from committing indecent deeds  whether openly or in secret  and do not kill the life which god has made sacred  save by right that is what he has enjoined upon you  so that you may understand ","940":"stay well away from an orphan s property  except with the best intentions  before he comes of age give full measure and weight  according to justice  we never charge a soul with more than it can bear  when you speak  observe justice  even though it concerns a close relative  and fulfil the covenants of god that is what he has enjoined upon you so that you may take heed ","941":" he has enjoined    this is my straight path

our favour to the righteous  explaining everything clearly  as guidance and mercy  so that they might believe in meeting their lord ","943":"this is a book which we have revealed as a blessing  follow it and fear your lord  so that you may receive mercy ","944":"and not say   the book was only sent down to the two groups before us and we were indeed unaware of their teachings  ","945":"or you may say   if the book had been sent down to us  we would surely have followed its guidance better than they did   there has now come to you clear evidence from your lord  and guidance and mercy who  then  is more unjust than one who rejects the signs of god and turns away from them we shall requite those who turn away from our signs with a painful punishment  for their turning away ","946":"are they waiting for the angels or your lord to come down to them  or for some of your lord s signs to come the day when some of the signs of your lord shall come  it shall not profit any human being who did not believe before  or who did not do any good by his faith say to them   wait then  we too are waiting  ","947":"have nothing to do with those who have split up their religion into sects their case rests with god  he will tell them about what they used to do ","948":"whoever does a good deed will be repaid tenfold  but those who do a bad deed will only be repaid with its equivalent and they shall not be wronged ","949":"say   my lord has guided me to a straight path  and to an upright religion  the religion of abraham the upright  who was not of those who associate partners with god

","952":"say   shall i seek a lord other than god  while he is the lord of all things   everyone must bear the consequence of what he does  and no bearer of a burden can bear the burden of another then to your lord you will return  and he will inform you of what you used to dispute about ","953":"it is he who has made you successors of others on the earth and has exalted some of you over the others in degrees of rank  so that he may test you by that which he has given you your lord is swift in punishment  yet surely he is forgiving  and merciful ","954":"alif lam mim sad ","955":"this book has been sent down to you  let there be no heaviness in your heart about it  so that you may warn by means of it and it is a reminder to the believers ","956":"follow what has been sent down to you by your lord and do not follow any protector other than him how seldom you take heed ","957":"how many towns we have destroyed our scourge fell upon them by night or at midday when they were resting ","958":"and when our scourge fell upon them  their only cry was   we were indeed wrongdoers  ","959":"then shall we question those to whom our message was sent and those through whom we sent it","960":"with full knowledge  we shall tell them what they did  for we have never been away from them ","961":"truth alone will be of weight that day those whose scales are heavy shall be successful ","962":"and those whose good deeds are light in the balance will be the ones who have lost themselves because they wrongfully rejected our signs ","963":"we established you in the land and provided you with a means of livelihood there  yet you are seldom thankful ","964":"we created you  then we shaped you and then we said to the angels   prostrate yourselves before adam   and they all prostrated themselves  except satan he was not among those who prostrated themselves ","965":"god asked   what prevented you from prostrating yourself when i commanded you to   he replied   i am better than he is  you created me from fire  while you created him from clay  ","966":"god said   get down from here  this is no place for your arrogance get out  you are contemptible  ","967":"satan said   give me respite until the day of resurrection  ","968":"and god replied   you are granted respite  ","969":"then satan said   because you have put me in the wrong  i will lie in ambush for them on your straight path ","970":"then i will surely come upon them from before them and from behind them and from their right and from their left  and then you will find most of them ungrateful  ","971":"he said   get out of here  despised  and rejected  i shall fill hell with all of those who follow you  ","972":"to adam he said   you and your wife  dwell in the garden and eat and drink there from wherever you wish  but do not approach this tree  lest you become wrongdoers  ","973":"but satan tempted them so that he might reveal to them their nakedness which had been hidden from them he said   your lord has forbidden you to approach this tree lest you should become angels or become of the immortals  ","974":"and he swore to them   surely  i am your well wisher  ","975":"thus he cunningly seduced them when they tasted the tree s fruit  their nakedness became exposed to them and they started covering themselves with the leaves of the garden their lord called out to them   did i not forbid you to approach that tree  and did i not say to you that satan was surely your open enemy  ","976":"they replied   our lord  we have wronged our souls  if you do not forgive us and have mercy on us  we shall be among the lost  ","977":"he said   go down from here as enemies to each other for a while  there is an abode for you and a provision on earth ","978":"there you will live  there you will die  from there you will be raised up again  ","979":"o children of adam  we have sent down to you clothes to cover your nakedness  and to be pleasing to the eye  but the raiment of righteousness is the best that is one of the signs of god so that people may take heed ","980":"children of adam  do not let satan seduce you  just as he turned your parents out of the garden  he deprived them of their garment in order to make them aware of their nakedness he and his forces watch you from where you do not see them  we have made the devils friends of those who do not believe ","981":"and when they commit an indecency  they say   this is what our fathers used to do and god has enjoined it on us   say   god does not enjoin what is indecent would you attribute to god something of which you have no knowledge  ","982":"say   my lord has commanded you to act justly turn your faces up toward him at every time and place of worship  and call upon him  making yourselves sincere towards him in religion as he brought you into being  so shall you return  ","983":"some he has guided and some have earned misguidance  they have taken devils rather than god as their patrons  thinking that they are rightly guided ","984":"o children of adam  dress yourself properly whenever you are at worship  and eat and drink but do not be wasteful  god does not like wasteful people ","985":"say   who has forbidden the adornment of god  which he has brought forth for his servants and good things  clean and pure  which god has provided for his servants   say   they are lawful for the believers in the present life but they shall be exclusively for them on the day of resurrection   thus we explain our signs for a people who understand ","986":"say  my lord has forbidden indecency  both open and hidden  sin and wrongful oppression and that  without his sanction  you associate things with him  and that you say things about him without knowledge ","987":"for all people a term has been set  and when the end of their term approaches  they can neither delay it by a single moment  nor can they advance it ","988":"children of adam  if messengers come to you from among yourselves  reciting my revelations to you  then those that take warning and mend their ways  on such shall come no fear nor shall they grieve ","989":"but those who deny and scorn our revelations shall be the inmates of hell  where they shall remain forever ","990":"who does a greater wrong than he who invents lies against god or rejects his revelations such people will have what has been decreed for them and when our messengers come to them to take away their souls  they shall ask them   where are those you used to call upon besides god   they will answer   they have deserted us   and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers ","991":"god will say   enter the fire and join the bands of jinn and men that have gone before you   every time a host enters the fire   it will curse its fellow host  then  when they are all gathered there  the last of them will say of the first   our lord  it was they who led us astray  give them double punishment in the fire      god will say   every one of you will have double punishment  though you do not know it    ","992":"then the preceding one will say to the succeeding one  you are no better than us  so taste the punishment you have earned  ","993":"the gates of heaven shall not be opened for those who rejected our signs and arrogantly spurned them  nor shall they enter paradise until a camel shall pass through the eye of a needle that is how we repay the evil doers ","994":"hell shall be their bed  and over them will be coverings of fire  thus shall we reward the wrongdoers ","995":"but those who believed and did good deeds  and we do not burden any soul with more than it can bear  such are the heirs of the garden and there they will remain forever ","996":"and we shall remove whatever rancour may be in their hearts at their feet shall flow rivers and they shall say   all praise belongs to god who has guided us to this had god not guided us  we would never have found the way the messengers of our lord brought the truth   a voice will call out to them   this is the garden which you have inherited by your labours  ","997":"the people of the garden will call out to the people of the fire   we have found that what our lord promised us is true have you  too  found that what your lord promised you is true   they will say   yes  we have   then a crier shall call out among them saying   the curse of god is upon the wrongdoers   ","998":"who turned people away from the path of god and sought to make it appear crooked  and who denied the hereafter  ","999":"a barrier will divide the two groups  and on the heights there will be men who recognize each group by their marks they will call out to the people of the garden   peace be with you   they will not have yet entered  but they will be hoping to do so  ","1000":"and when they turn their eyes towards the inmates of the fire  they will say   our lord  do not include us among the wrongdoers  ","1001":"and the people of the heights will call out to men they recognize by their marks   what use have your great numbers and your false pride been ","1002":"see  are these not the people you swore would never earn god s mercy enter the garden  no fear shall come upon you nor shall you grieve  ","1003":"the people of the fire shall call out to the people of heaven   pour out some water on us  or give us something out of that which god has bestowed upon you   but the blessed will reply   god has forbidden all that to those who denied the truth ","1004":"who treated religion as a pastime and an idle sport and whom the life of the world had beguiled   on that day we shall forget them  as they forgot their meeting of that day with us  for they denied our revelations ","1005":"and surely we have brought them a book which we have expounded with knowledge  a guide and a mercy for those who believe ","1006":"do they wait for the fulfillment of that of which it warns on the day when that fulfillment comes  those who had neglected it before will say   the messengers of our lord did indeed bring the truth have we then any intercessors who would intercede for us or  could we be sent back so that we might act differently from the way we used to   they have indeed ruined their souls and what they invented has forsaken them ","1007":"your lord is god  who created the heavens and the earth in six days periods and then settled himself firmly on the throne he throws the veil of night over the day  each seeking the other in rapid succession it was he who created the sun  the moon and the stars  and made them subservient to his will his is the creation  his the command blessed be god  lord of the universe ","1008":"call on your lord with humility and in secret  he does not love the transgressors ","1009":"do not spread corruption on the earth after it has been set in order  pray to him with fear and hope  god s mercy is close to those who do good ","1010":"it is god who sends forth the winds as harbingers of his mercy  and when they have gathered up the heavy clouds  we drive them on to a dead land where we cause rain to fall  bringing out all kinds of fruit  just as we will raise the dead to life perhaps you will take heed ","1011":"vegetation comes out of good land in abundance by the will of its lord  but out of bad land only scantily thus we explain our signs in diverse ways for those who give thanks ","1012":"we sent noah to his people he said   o my people  worship god  you have no other god but he i fear for you the punishment of a dreadful day  ","1013":"but the leading men of his people said   truly  we see that you are obviously lost in error  ","1014":"said noah    o my people  i am not in error indeed  i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds ","1015":"i am conveying my lord s messages to you and giving you sincere advice i know things from god that you do not ","1016":"do you find it so strange that a message should come from your lord through a man from among yourselves  so that he may warn you and so that you may fear god and be shown mercy  ","1017":"but they denied him  so we saved him and those with him in the ark  and we drowned those who rejected our signs they were indeed a blind people ","1018":"to the people of ad we sent their brother  hud he said   o my people  worship god  you have no other god but he then will you not be god fearing  ","1019":"the leading men of his people who refused to acknowledge the truth  said   we can see you are a foolish man  and we think you are lying  ","1020":"he said   my people  i am by no means a fool  but rather am a messenger from the lord of the universe ","1021":"i am conveying my lord s messages to you and i am your sincere and honest adviser ","1022":"do you find it strange that a message should come from your lord  through one of your own men  to warn you remember how he made you successors of noah s people  and increased you greatly in stature remember the favours of god  so that you may prosper  ","1023":"they said   have you come to tell us to serve god alone and to forsake the gods our forefathers served bring us then what you threaten us with  if you are truthful  ","1024":"he said   your lord s wrath and indignation have already fallen upon you would you dispute with me about mere names  which you and your fathers have invented  and for which god has revealed no authority wait then if you will  i am waiting alongside you  ","1025":"then we saved him and those who were with him  by our mercy  we annihilated those who denied our signs and would not believe ","1026":"to the thamud we sent their brother salih he said   o my people  worship god  you have no other god but him a veritable proof has come to you from your lord  this is god s she camel  a sign for you  so let her feed in god s land and do not harm her in any way  or you will be overwhelmed by a painful punishment ","1027":"remember when he made you successors to the ad and settled you in the land you built palaces on its plains and carved houses out of the mountains remember god s blessings and do not spread corruption in the land  ","1028":"but the arrogant leaders of his people said to the believers who were deemed weak   do you know for certain that salih is one sent from his lord   they replied   we believe in the message which has been sent through him  ","1029":"the arrogant leaders said   we reject what you believe in  ","1030":"so they hamstrung the she camel  and insolently defied the commandment of their lord  saying   o salih  bring upon us what you threaten us with if you are indeed a messenger  ","1031":"so the earthquake overwhelmed them  and morning found them prostrate in their dwelling places ","1032":"he left them  saying   my people  i delivered my lord s messages to you and counselled you sincerely  but you do not like sincere advisors  ","1033":"we sent lot  who said to his people   how can you commit an abomination such as no one in the world has ever done before you ","1034":"you lust after men rather than women  you transgress all bounds  ","1035":"the only answer given by his people was   turn them out of your town they are people who regard themselves to be pure  ","1036":"so we saved him and his family    except for his wife she was one of those who stayed behind ","1037":"we rained down on them a shower of brimstone then see what was the end of the evil doers ","1038":"to midian we sent their brother shu ayb he said   o my people  worship god  you have no other god but him a clear sign has indeed come to you from your lord so give full measure and full weight  and do not deliver short do not corrupt the land after it has been set in order this is for your own good  if you are true believers ","1039":"do not lie in ambush on every pathway  threatening people  barring those who believe from the way of god  seeking to make it appear crooked remember when you were few in number and he multiplied you consider the fate of those who used to spread corruption ","1040":"and if there is a group of you which believes in my message and others who disbelieve it  be patient until god shall judge between us he is the best of judges  ","1041":"the arrogant leaders of his people said   shu ayb  we will expel you and your fellow believers from our town unless you return to our faith   he said   even though we detest it ","1042":"we would be inventing lies against god if we returned to your faith after god has delivered us from it it is not for us to return to it unless god our lord so willed our lord encompasses all things in his knowledge we have put our trust in god our lord  expose the truth and judge between us and our people  you are the best judge  ","1043":"the leading men of his people who were bent on denying the truth  said   if you follow shu ayb  you will certainly be the losers  ","1044":"thereupon an earthquake overtook them and morning found them lying flattened in their homes ","1045":"those who had denied shu ayb became as though they had never lived there those who denied shu ayb  were themselves the losers ","1046":"so he turned away from them  saying   my people  i delivered my lord s messages to you and gave you sincere advice  so why should i grieve for people who refused to believe  ","1047":"whenever we sent a prophet to a town  we afflicted its people with suffering and adversity  so that they might humble themselves before god  ","1048":"and then we changed their hardship into ease until they grew affluent and said   our fathers had also experienced adversity and prosperity   then we seized them suddenly  unawares ","1049":"had the people of those towns believed in and feared god  we would have showered upon them blessings from heaven and earth  but they rejected the truth so we seized them on account of their misdeeds ","1050":"do the people of these towns now feel secure against the coming of our punishment upon them by night while they are asleep ","1051":"or  do they feel secure against the coming of our punishment upon them in the forenoon while they are at play ","1052":"do they feel secure against god s devising no one feels secure against god s devising except for those doomed to ruin ","1053":"does it not guide the people who inherit the land from former people that we can punish them for their sins if we will and seal up their hearts so that they would not be able to lend an ear to words of guidance ","1054":"we have told you the stories of those towns  their messengers came to them with clear signs  but they were never going to believe in something they had already rejected thus god seals up the hearts of those who deny the truth ","1055":"we found most of them untrue to their covenants  indeed we found most of them to be defiant ","1056":"after them we sent moses with our signs to pharaoh and his chiefs but they willfully rejected them consider the end of the evil doers ","1057":"moses said   pharaoh  i am a messenger from the lord of the universe ","1058":"duty bound to say nothing about god but the truth  and i have brought you a clear sign from your lord let the children of israel go with me  ","1059":" pharaoh said   if you come with a sign  then produce it  if you are telling the truth  ","1060":"then moses threw down his staff and suddenly  unmistakably  it appeared as a serpent ","1061":"and he drew forth his hand  and it appeared shining white to the beholders ","1062":"the chiefs of pharaoh s people said   this is most surely a skillful magician ","1063":"who seeks to drive you from your land   pharaoh said   what then do you advise  ","1064":"they said   let him and his brother wait awhile  and send into the cities summoners ","1065":"who should bring to you every skillful magician  ","1066":"and the magicians came to pharaoh and asked   shall we have a reward  if we should prevail  ","1067":"pharaoh replied   certainly  and you shall also become my courtiers  ","1068":"they said   moses  will you first throw  or shall we  ","1069":"he said   you throw first    when they made their cast  they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck them with awe  for they showed a great feat of magic ","1070":"then we inspired moses  saying   throw down your staff   and it immediately swallowed up their false devices ","1071":"thus the truth prevailed and what they had produced came to nothing ","1072":"pharaoh and his men were defeated and utterly humiliated ","1073":"and the sorcerers prostrated themselves","1074":"and said   we believe in the lord of the universe ","1075":"the lord of moses and aaron  ","1076":"pharaoh said   you dare believe in him before i have given you permission behold  this is indeed a plot which you have devised in this city in order to drive its people out but you shall soon know the consequences ","1077":"i will cut off your hands and feet on alternate sides and then crucify you all  ","1078":"they replied   we shall surely return to our lord ","1079":"you would punish us only because we believed in the signs of our lord when they were shown to us our lord  pour patience upon us  and cause us to die in a state of submission to you  ","1080":"the chiefs of pharaoh s people said   will you allow moses and his people to spread corruption in the land  and to forsake you and your gods   he replied   we shall kill their male children and spare only the females we have complete power over them  ","1081":"moses said to his people   turn to god for help and be patient the earth belongs to god he gives it to those of his servants whom he chooses  and the future belongs to the god fearing  ","1082":"they replied   we were being persecuted before you came to us  and we are still being persecuted   he said   your lord may well destroy your enemy and make you successors to the land then he will see how you conduct yourselves  ","1083":"we afflicted pharaoh s people with shortages of food and famine so that they might take heed ","1084":"then when something good came to them  they said   it is our due      but when something bad came  they ascribed it as an ill omen to moses and those with him surely their evil fortune had been decreed by god  but most of them did not know this ","1085":"they said   whatever miracles you work to bewitch us  we will not believe in you  ","1086":"then we afflicted them with storms  and locusts  and lice  and frogs  and blood  so many clear signs but they were steeped in arrogance  for they were a people given to sin ","1087":"whenever a plague struck them  they would say   moses  pray to your lord for us by virtue of the promise he has made to you  if you remove this plague from us  we will surely believe in you and let the children of israel go with you  ","1088":"but whenever we removed the plague from them  giving them time to make good their promise  they would break their word ","1089":"so we exacted retribution from them and drowned them in the sea  because they rejected our signs and paid no heed to them ","1090":"we made the people who were considered weak inheritors of the eastern parts and western parts of the land which we had blessed thus your lord s good promise to the children of israel was fulfilled  because of their patience  and we destroyed all that pharaoh and his people had built and all that they had raised high ","1091":"we brought the children of israel across the sea and they came upon a people who were devoted to their idols they said   moses  give us a god just like the gods these people have   he said   you are indeed an ignorant people ","1092":"what they are engaged in is doomed to destruction and all their works are in vain  ","1093":"he said   shall i seek a deity for you other than god  while it is he who has exalted you above all peoples ","1094":"we delivered you from pharaoh s people  who afflicted you with dreadful torment  slaying your male children and sparing only your daughters that was surely a great trial for you by your lord  ","1095":"we appointed thirty nights for moses  then added ten more  the term set by his lord was fulfilled in forty nights moses said to his brother aaron   take my place among my people  act rightly and do not follow the way of those who spread corruption  ","1096":"and when moses came at our appointed time and his lord spoke to him  he said   my lord  show yourself to me so that i may look at you   he replied   you cannot see me  but look at the mountain  if it remains firmly in its place  then only will you see me   and when his lord manifested himself on the mountain  he broke it into pieces and moses fell down unconscious and when he recovered  he said   glory be to you  i turn towards you  and i am the first to believe  ","1097":"he replied   moses  i have chosen you of all mankind for my messages and my words hold fast to what i have given you  and be among the grateful  ","1098":"and we wrote for him upon the tablets an admonition and details of all things  then bade him    hold fast to them  and command your people to follow them in their best sense soon i shall show you the home of the wicked ","1099":"i will turn away from my signs all those who are arrogant in the land without any right  so that even if they see all the signs they will not believe in them if they see the right path  they shall not walk upon it  but if they see the path of error  they shall choose it for their path  because they have given the lie to our signs and paid no heed to them ","1100":"the actions of those who denied our signs and the meeting of the hereafter will come to nothing    they shall be requited only  according to their deeds  ","1101":"in his absence  the people of moses made a calf from their ornaments  an image which made a lowing sound could they not see that it did not speak to them or guide them in any way yet they took to worshipping it  they were evil doers ","1102":"when they were afflicted with remorse  and realized that they had indeed gone astray  they said   if our lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us  we shall be among the lost  ","1103":"when moses returned to his people in anger and great sorrow  he said   what an awful sin you have committed in my absence did you want to hasten your lord s command   he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the head  pulling him towards himself aaron said   son of my mother  the people oppressed me and almost killed me do not give my enemies cause to gloat over me do not number me among the wrongdoers  ","1104":"he said   my lord  forgive me and my brother and admit us to your mercy you are the most merciful of the merciful  ","1105":"those who took to worshipping the calf will be afflicted by their lord s wrath  and be disgraced in the life of this world this is the way we requite those who invent falsehoods ","1106":"as for those who committed evils  and thereafter repented and believed  they shall find your lord forgiving and merciful ","1107":"when his anger had subsided  moses took up the tablets upon which was inscribed a pledge of guidance and mercy for those who fear their lord ","1108":"and moses chose from his people seventy men for our appointment when they were seized with violent quaking  he prayed   o my lord  if it had been your will  you could have destroyed both them and me long ago but would you destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us this is no more than your trial  by it you cause whom you will to stray  and you lead whom you will to the right path you are our protector forgive us  therefore  and have mercy on us  for you are the best of those who forgive ","1109":"grant us good things  both in this life and in the hereafter to you alone we turn   he replied   as for my punishment  i smite with it anyone i will but my mercy encompasses all things i shall prescribe it for those who do their duty  pay the zakat and who believe in our signs ","1110":"also for those who follow the messenger  the unlettered prophet they find described in the torah that is with them  and in the gospel  who commands them to do right and forbids them to do wrong  who makes good things lawful to them and bad things unlawful  who will relieve them of their burdens and of the shackles that weigh upon them those that believe in him and honour him  those that aid him and follow the light sent down with him  shall surely triumph  ","1111":"say   people  i am god s messenger to you all  he has sovereignty over the heavens and the earth there is no god but him he ordains life and death  so believe in god and his messenger  the unlettered prophet who believes in god and his words follow him so that you may be rightly guided  ","1112":"yet there is a group among the people of moses who guide with truth and act justly in accordance with it ","1113":"we divided them up into twelve tribes  each a whole community  and we revealed our will to moses  when his people asked for water  saying   strike the rock with your staff   twelve springs gushed from it and each tribe knew its drinking place we caused the clouds to draw their shadow over them and sent down for them manna and quails  saying   eat the good things we have given you   they did not wrong us  rather it was themselves they wronged ","1114":"when they were told   settle down in the town and eat wherever you wish in it  and pray for forgiveness and enter the gate in humility  we shall forgive you your sins and shall bestow further favours upon those who do good  ","1115":"the transgressors among them substituted something else for the word they had been given so we sent them a punishment from heaven for their wrongdoing ","1116":"ask them about the town which was by the sea and what befell its people when they broke the sabbath on their sabbath the fish came to them near the surface  but on week days they never came near them    thus we tried them because of their disobedience ","1117":"when some of them asked   why do you admonish a people whom god is going to destroy or to afflict with a severe punishment   they answered   in order to be free from blame before your lord  and that they may perhaps fear him  ","1118":"therefore when they forgot what they had been reminded of  we saved those who had tried to prevent the doing of evil and we meted out a severe punishment to the transgressors because they were rebellious ","1119":"and then  when they disdainfully persisted in doing what they had been forbidden to do  we said to them   be as apes  despised  ","1120":"then your lord declared that  until the day of resurrection  he would send others against them to inflict terrible suffering on them your lord is swift in retribution  yet surely he is most forgiving and merciful ","1121":"we split them up into sections on the earth some of them are righteous while some of them are otherwise  and we tested them with blessings and misfortunes  so that they might return to the right path ","1122":"they were succeeded by generations who inherited the scripture and took to the fleeting gains of this world  saying   we shall certainly be forgiven   if there came to them similar fleeting gains again  they would take them was a pledge not taken from them  written in the scripture  that they would not say anything but the truth about god and they have studied whatever is in it surely the home of the hereafter is better for those who fear him will you not understand ","1123":"as for those who hold fast to the book and are steadfast in prayer  we shall not deny the righteous their reward ","1124":"when we suspended the mountain over them as if it were a canopy  and they thought it was going to fall down on them  we said   hold on

wronged themselves ","1305":"the believers  both men and women  are friends to each other  they enjoin what is good and forbid evil  they attend to their prayers and pay the alms and obey god and his messenger on these god will have mercy  for god is almighty and wise ","1306":"god has promised the believers  both men and women  gardens through which rivers flow  wherein they will abide  and fine

meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out  and being spiteful was their only response to god  who had enriched them out of his bounty  and to his messenger if they repent  it will indeed be better for them if they turn away  god will punish them with grievous suffering in this world and the hereafter  and there will be no one on earth to protect or help them ","1309":"there are some among them who pledged themselves to god  saying   if god gives us something out of his bounty  we shall certainly give alms and be righteous  ","1310":"but when he bestowed his favours on them they grew niggardly  and turned away in aversion ","1311":"so he caused hypocrisy to settle in their hearts until the day of their meeting with him  because they broke their word to god  and because they lied ","1312":"do they not know that god knows what they conceal and what they talk about in secret that god knows all that is hidden ","1313":"as for those who ridicule such believers as give alms freely for the sake of god and taunt those who find nothing to give save that which they earn through their toil  god will cause their ridicule to rebound on them  they shall have a painful punishment

most forgiving and merciful ","1334":"as for those who led the way  the first of the emigrants and the supporters  as well as those who nobly followed them  god is well pleased with them  and they are well pleased with him  he has prepared for them gardens through which rivers flow  where they shall dwell forever that is the supreme achievement ","1335":"some of the desert arabs around you are hypocrites as are some of the people of madinah    they are obdurate in their hypocrisy you do not know them  but we know them we shall cause them to suffer doubly and then they will be subjected to a great punishment ","1336":"there are others who have confessed their wrongdoing  who have done some good deeds and some bad ones it is likely that god will turn to them in mercy surely  god is most

sight of god  god will not deny the righteous their reward ","1355":"and whenever they spend anything for the sake of god   be it little or much  and whenever they traverse the land in god s cause

inquirers ","1603":"they said to each other    surely joseph and his brother benjamin are dearer to our father than ourselves  although we are a band truly  our father is clearly mistaken

of this deed of theirs  when they do not realize who you are  ","1611":"and at nightfall they came to their father  weeping ","1612":"they said   father  we went off racing and left joseph with our

your souls have tempted you to do something evil  but it is best to be patient  god alone can help me bear the loss you speak of  ","1614":"and there came a caravan of travellers and they sent their water drawer to draw water from the well he let down his bucket into the well and he exclaimed   oh  what a lucky find  here is a boy   they hid him like a piece of merchandise  but god knew well what they did ","1615":"later they sold him for a paltry sum  a few pieces of silver dirhams   so little did they value him ","1616":"the egyptian who bought him said to his wife   lodge him honourably  he may prove of benefit to us  or we may even adopt him as our son   thus we established joseph in the land  so that we might teach him the true meaning of events god has power over all things however  most people do not know this ","1617":"and when he reached maturity  we bestowed on him right judgement and knowledge thus we reward those who do good ","1618":"however  the woman in whose house he lived  wanted to seduce him one day she bolted the doors and said   come   he replied   god forbid  truly your husband is my master and has treated me honourably wrongdoers certainly never prosper  ","1619":"she started towards him  and he would have succumbed to her  if he had not seen a sign from his lord    we did this in order to keep evil and indecency away from him  for he was truly one of our chosen servants ","1620":"they both ran to the door and  in the struggle  she tore his shirt at the back they found her husband at the door she cried   shall not the man who wished to violate your wife be thrown into prison or sternly punished  ","1621":"joseph said   it was she who sought to seduce me   one of her household testified   if his shirt is torn at the front then she is speaking the truth  and he is lying ","1622":"but if it is torn from behind then she is lying  and he speaks the truth  ","1623":"so when he saw his shirt torn from behind her husband said   this is the guile of you women your guile is great indeed ","1624":"joseph  overlook this  but you wife   ask forgiveness for your sin  for you have done wrong  ","1625":"women in the town began to gossip   the nobleman s wife is trying to seduce her slave  love for him consumes her heart  indeed  we see her in manifest error  ","1626":"when she heard of their intrigues  she sent for them and prepared a party for them she gave a knife to each of them to cut fruits  etc and then asked joseph to appear before them when the women saw him  they were greatly amazed at his beauty   and they cut their hands  exclaiming   god preserve us  this is no human being but a noble angel  ","1627":"she said   this is he about whom you have been blaming me  and  indeed  i did try to make him yield to me  but he was unyielding now  however  if he does not do as i bid him  he shall certainly be put in prison and be humiliated  ","1628":"joseph said   o my lord  i would prefer prison to what these women are inviting me to do and if you do not avert their guile from me  i may yield to them and so become one of the ignorant  ","1629":"so his lord answered him and warded off their guile he is all hearing and all knowing ","1630":"yet  even after all the evidence they had seen  they thought it right to jail him for a time ","1631":"two young men entered the prison along with him one of them said   i saw myself in a dream i was pressing wine   the other said   i dreamed i was carrying bread on my head from which the birds were eating tell us their meaning  for we see that you are one who does good to all  ","1632":"joseph said to them   i shall inform you of the interpretation of your dreams before your meal is brought to you this is a part of the knowledge that my lord has taught me i have renounced the religion of the people who do not believe in god and who deny the hereafter ","1633":"i follow the religion of my fathers  abraham  isaac and jacob  and it is not for us to associate anyone with god as a partner this is of god s grace upon us and upon mankind  even though most men are not grateful ","1634":"o my two fellow prisoners  are many diverse lords better  or god  the one  the almighty ","1635":"all those you worship instead of him are mere names you and your forefathers have invented  names for which god has sent down no authority  all power belongs to god alone  and he orders you to worship none but him  this is the true faith  though most people do not realize it ","1636":"o my two fellow prisoners  one of you will serve wine to his lord  the other of you will be crucified and birds will feed off his head the matter about which you have been seeking my opinion has been so decreed  ","1637":"he said to the one he thought would be saved   mention me to your master   however satan made him forget to mention him to his master  and so joseph remained in prison for a number of years ","1638":"the king said   i saw in a dream seven fat cows which seven lean ones were eating  also seven green ears of corn and seven others which were dry tell me the meaning of this vision  my nobles  if you can interpret visions  ","1639":"they said   these are confusing dreams and we do not know the interpretation of such dreams  ","1640":"then one of the two men who had been released and who  after a long time  remembered  said   i shall tell you its interpretation  therefore  give me leave to go to joseph in prison  ","1641":"o truthful joseph  he said   tell us the meaning of a dream in which seven fat cows are being eaten by seven lean ones  and there are seven green ears of corn and seven others which are dry  so that i may return to my people and inform them  ","1642":"joseph said   you shall sow for seven consecutive years as usual  but leave in the ear the harvest that you reap  except for a little which you may eat ","1643":"then there will follow seven years of great hardship which will consume all but a little of what you stored ","1644":"then a year will come after that when people will have abundant rain and when once more they will press wine and oil  ","1645":"the king said   bring him to me   when the king s messenger came to joseph  he said   go back to your master and ask him about the women who cut their hands  my lord knows well their guile  ","1646":"the king asked the women   what was the truth of the affair in which you tried to seduce joseph   the women said   god forbid  we know no evil of him   the wife of the nobleman said   the truth has now come to light it was i who tried to seduce him  he is surely an honest man  ","1647":"from this  said joseph    the nobleman should know that i did not betray him in his absence  and that god does not guide the plotting of the treacherous ","1648":"i am not trying to absolve myself  for man s very soul incites him to evil unless my lord bestows his mercy indeed  my lord is forgiving and merciful  ","1649":"the king said   bring him to me i will take him for my special service   and when he had spoken to him  he said   from now on you will dwell with us  honoured and trusted  ","1650":"joseph said   place in my charge the storehouses of the land  for i am a good and knowledgeable custodian  ","1651":"thus we caused joseph to be established in a position of authority in the land he could dwell therein wherever he pleased we bestow our mercy on whomever we please  and we do not allow the reward of the righteous to go to waste ","1652":"yet the reward of the hereafter is best for those who believe and are mindful of god ","1653":"joseph s brothers arrived and presented themselves before him he recognized them  but they did not know him ","1654":"when he had made provision for them  he told them   bring me your brother on your father s side do you not see that i give you full measure and that i am the best of hosts ","1655":"but if you do not bring him to me  you shall have no grain from me  nor shall you ever approach me again  ","1656":"they replied   we shall try to persuade his father to send him with us we shall do our utmost   ","1657":"joseph said to his servants   put their money back into their saddlebags  so that they will recognize it when they return home to their family  thus they may come back  ","1658":"when they returned to their father  they said   our father  any further measure of grain has been

situation ","2156":"the sun could be observed to incline away from their cave on the right  as it rose  and to turn away from them on the left  when it set  while they lay in the wide space inside the cave this is one of the signs of god he whom god guides is rightly guided  but for him whom he lets go astray  you will find no helper or guide ","2157":"you would have thought they were awake  though

back and fled in terror ","2158":"in the course of time  we raised them up again so that they might question one another one of them asked   how long have you stayed here   they said   we have stayed a day  or part of a day   but others said   your lord knows best how long you have stayed here let one of you go then with these silver coins to the town  and let him find out what food is purest

build a place of worship over them  ","2161":"some will say   they were three  the fourth was their dog   and others will say   they were five  the sixth was their dog   guessing at random and yet

information about them from any of them ","2162":"never say of anything   i shall certainly do this tomorrow  ","2163":"without adding    if god so wills   remember your lord whenever you might forget and say   i trust my lord will guide me to that which is even nearer to the right path than this  ","2164":" some say    they stayed in their cave three hundred years   and to that some have added another nine years ","2165":"say   god knows best how long they stayed in it   only god has knowledge of the unseen in the heavens and on the earth how well he sees and how well he hears  man has no other guardian besides him he allows none to share his sovereignty ","2166":"proclaim what has been revealed to you from your lord s book none can change his words you shall find no refuge besides him

do not obey one whose heart we have made heedless of our remembrance  one who pursues his own whims and becomes dissolute ","2168":"say   this is the truth from your lord let him who will  believe in it  and him who will  deny it   for the wrongdoers we have prepared a fire which will cover them like a canopy  and if they beg for water  they will be given water as hot as molten lead  which will scald their faces  how dreadful a drink  and how evil a resting place ","2169":"as for those who believe and do good deeds  we do not let the reward of anyone who does a good deed go to waste ","2170":"they shall dwell in the gardens of eternity where rivers flow at their feet reclining upon raised couches  they will be adorned with bracelets of gold  and will wear green robes of fine silk and heavy brocade an excellent reward and an excellent resting place ","2171":"recite to them the parable of two men  one of them we provided with two vineyards which we surrounded with date palms  and placed a field of grain in between ","2172":"each garden produced its fruit and did not fail to yield its best  we even caused a river to gush forth in the midst of them ","2173":"and so he had fruit in abundance while conversing with his companion  he said   i am wealthier than you are  and have a bigger following  ","2174":"having thus harmed his own soul  he entered his garden saying   i do not think this will ever perish ","2175":"and i do not believe that the hour will ever come even if i am returned to my lord  i shall surely find a better place than this  ","2176":"his companion replied  in the course of their discussion   do you deny him who created you from dust  from a small drop of fluid  then formed you into a man ","2177":"but as far as i am concerned  god alone is my lord and i set up no partners with him ","2178":"when you entered your garden  why did you not say   that which god wills will surely come to pass   there is no power save with god   although you see i have less wealth and offspring than you ","2179":"my lord may well give me a garden better than yours and send down thunderbolts from heaven upon your vineyard  turning it into a barren waste ","2180":"or its water may sink into the earth  so that you will never be able to find it again  ","2181":"so it was  and all his fruit was destroyed the vines had all fallen down on their trellises  and their owner wrung his hands  bewailing all that he had spent on his garden he said   would that i had not associated anyone with my lord  ","2182":"he had no party to help him against god  nor was he able to defend himself ","2183":"the only support is from god  the true god he is the best in rewarding and the best in respect of the final outcome ","2184":"give them an example about worldly life it is like the vegetation of the earth that thrives when watered by the rain  which we send down from the sky  and then it all becomes stubble which the wind blows away god has power over all things ","2185":"wealth and children are an ornament of the life of this world but deeds of lasting merit are better rewarded by your lord and a far better source of hope ","2186":"the day we shall make the mountains move and you will see the earth laid bare  and we shall gather all mankind together and shall not leave any one of them behind ","2187":"they will be ranged before your lord  standing in rows and he will say to them   now you have come to us as we created you at first but you supposed that we would not appoint the time for the fulfillment of our promise to you  ","2188":"the book of deeds will be placed before them and you will see the guilty apprehensive about its contents they will say   woe to us  what a record this is  it does not leave any deed  small or large  unaccounted for   they will find everything they ever did laid in front of them  your lord will not be unjust to anyone ","2189":"when we said to the angels   prostrate yourselves before adam   all prostrated themselves except satan he was one of the jinn and he disobeyed his lord s command do you then take him and his offspring as protectors instead of me  despite their enmity towards you this is an evil exchange for the wrongdoers ","2190":"i did not call them to witness at the creation of the heavens and the earth  nor at their own creation  i do not take as my helpers those who lead others astray ","2191":"on that day he will say to them   call on those whom you thought to be my partners   and they will call on them  but their prayer will not be heard  and we shall place a barrier of enmity between them ","2192":"the guilty shall see the fire and realize that they are going to fall into it  they shall find no way of escape from it ","2193":"we have explained in various ways in this quran  for the benefit of mankind  all kinds of examples  but man is most contentious ","2194":"nothing prevents people from believing when they are given guidance or from asking forgiveness of their lord  but the fact that the fate of the previous peoples should befall them or to have the punishment come upon them face to face ","2195":"we only send the messengers to bring good news and to give warning those who deny use fallacious arguments to nullify the truth  treating my revelations and my warnings as a jest ","2196":"who is more wicked than he who has been reminded of the revelations of his lord  then turns away from them and forgets what his own hands have done we have cast veils over their hearts lest they understand our words  and made them hard of hearing call them as you may to the right path  they shall never be guided ","2197":"your lord is the forgiving one  the possessor of mercy if he had to take them to task for the wrongs they have done  he would have hastened their punishment they have an appointed time beyond which there will be no escape for them ","2198":"we destroyed these communities when they went on doing wrong  and we appointed a time for their destruction ","2199":"recall how moses said to his servant   i shall not give up until i reach the place where both seas meet  even if it takes me years  ","2200":"but when at last they came to the land where the two seas met  they forgot their fish and it swiftly made its way into the sea ","2201":"after they had passed the place  moses said to his young companion   bring us our morning meal  we have indeed been fatigued by this journey  ","2202":"he replied   did you see when we were resting by the rock  that i forgot the fish satan made me forget it  so i did not mention it it made its way to the sea in a miraculous way  ","2203":"moses said   that is just what we were looking for   so they went back the way they had come ","2204":"and they found one of our servants to whom we had granted our mercy and had given a knowledge from ourself ","2205":"moses said to him   may i follow you  so that you may guide me by what you have been taught  ","2206":"he replied   you will not be able to bear with me patiently ","2207":"how could you be patient in matters beyond your knowledge  ","2208":"moses said   god willing  you will find me patient  and i will not disobey you in any thing  ","2209":"he said   well then  if you would follow me  do not ask me about anything till i speak of it to you  ","2210":"so they set out  but  when they got into a boat  the man made a hole in it moses exclaimed   have you made a hole in the boat to drown the people in it you have indeed done a dreadful thing  ","2211":"he replied   did i not tell you that you would never be able to bear with me patiently  ","2212":"he said   do not take me to task for what i have forgotten  and do not be hard on me on account of what i have done  ","2213":"so they travelled on then they met a young boy and the man killed him moses said   have you slain an innocent person without his having slain anyone indeed  you have done a terrible thing  ","2214":"the man said   did i not tell you that you would not be able to have any patience with me  ","2215":"moses replied   if i ever ask you about anything after this  do not let me accompany you i will have given you sufficient excuse  ","2216":"so they went on until they came to a town they asked its people for food  but were refused hospitality they found a wall in the town which was about to fall down his companion buttressed it and moses said   had you wished  you could have demanded payment for your labours  ","2217":"he answered   this is where you and i must part company but first i will tell you the meaning of the things you could not bear with patiently ","2218":"the boat belonged to some poor people who made their living from the sea i wanted to damage it because there was a king coming behind them who was seizing every boat by force ","2219":"as for the youth  his parents were believers and we feared that he would trouble them by rebellion and denial of truth ","2220":"we wanted their lord to replace him with someone purer than him and more compassionate ","2221":"the wall belonged to two young orphans in the town whose father had been a righteous man  and a treasure of theirs lay underneath it so your lord wanted them to come of age and then to dig up their treasure as a mercy from him i did not do it of my own accord that is the explanation of the things about which you were not able to restrain yourself ","2222":"they will ask you about dhu l qarnayn say   i will give you an account of him  ","2223":"we established him in the land  and gave him the means to achieve all things ","2224":"he travelled on a certain road ","2225":"until  when he reached the setting of the sun  he found it setting in a spring of murky water and near it he found some people we said   dhu l qarnayn  you can either punish them or else you can treat them with gentleness  ","2226":"he said   we shall certainly punish him who does wrong  then he shall be brought back to his lord who will punish him with a grievous punishment ","2227":"but whoever believes and does good works shall have a good reward and we shall facilitate his matter by our command  ","2228":"then he followed yet another path ","2229":"until he came to the rising place of the sun  where he found it rising on a people for whom we had provided no shelter from it ","2230":"thus indeed it was we had full knowledge of him ","2231":"then he followed still another path ","2232":"until he came between two mountains he found beside them a people who could scarcely understand a word of his language ","2233":"they said   o dhu l qarnayn  gog and magog are causing corruption in the land  so may we pay you tribute on condition that you set a barrier between us and them  ","2234":"he said   what my lord has given me is better than any tribute help me with a force of labourers and i will erect a barrier between you and them ","2235":"bring me blocks of iron   then  when he had filled the gap between the mountain sides he said    now blow on the fire with your bellows   when the iron blocks were red with heat  he said   bring me molten brass to pour on them  ","2236":"so they gog and magog were not able to scale it  nor were they able to bore through it ","2237":"and he said   this is a mercy from my lord but when the promise of my lord comes to pass  he will level it to dust my lord s promise is ever true  ","2238":"on that day  we shall let them surge against each other like waves and then the trumpet will be blown and we shall gather them all together ","2239":"on that day we shall lay hell bare before those who deny the truth ","2240":"who have turned a blind eye to my reminder and a deaf ear to my warning ","2241":"do those who deny the truth  think that they can make my servants patrons instead of me we have reserved hell as a lodging for those who deny the truth ","2242":"say   shall i tell you of those who will lose the most through their actions ","2243":"they are those whose efforts have been wasted in the life of the world while they thought they were doing good ","2244":"they are those who deny their lord s signs and the meeting with him   so their works are in vain  and we shall give them no weight on the day of resurrection ","2245":"hell will be their reward  because they denied the truth  and made a jest of my signs and my messengers ","2246":"those who believe and do good works shall have the gardens of paradise for their abode ","2247":"they shall forever dwell in the gardens of paradise  desiring no change ","2248":"tell them   if the ocean became ink for writing the words of my lord  surely the ocean would be exhausted before the words of my lord came to an end    even if we were to add another ocean to it  ","2249":"say   i am only a human being like yourselves it is revealed to me that your god is one god so let him who hopes to meet his lord do good deeds and let him associate no one else in the worship of his lord

to you  do not invent lies against god  lest he destroy you by some calamity  whoever invents lies is bound to fail  ","2409":"then they the magicians conferred among themselves  whispering to one another ","2410":"they said   certainly they are both magicians who want to drive you out of your land by their magic  and destroy your best traditions ","2411":"therefore  decide upon your plan and then come forward in ranks whoever gains the upper hand today shall surely triumph  ","2412":"they said   moses  will you throw down first  or shall we be the first to throw down  ","2413":"moses said   you throw down first   suddenly their ropes and staffs appeared to him  by their magic  to be moving about rapidly ","2414":"and in his heart moses became apprehensive ","2415":"but we said   do not

punishment is more severe and more lasting  ","2419":"they said   never shall we prefer you to all the evidence of the truth that has come to us nor to him who has brought us into being so decide whatever you will your jurisdiction only covers the life of this world   ","2420":"we have believed in our lord so that he may forgive us our sins and forgive us the sorcery that you have forced us to practice god is the best and the most abiding  ","2421":"indeed  he who comes to his lord a sinner shall be consigned to hell  he shall neither die therein nor live ","2422":"but he who comes to him as a believer  having done good deeds  shall be exalted to the highest ranks ","2423":"he will abide forever in the gardens of eternity  through which rivers flow that is the recompense for those who purify themselves ","2424":"we sent a revelation to moses saying   take away my servants by night and strike for them a dry path through the sea have no fear of being overtaken and do not be afraid  ","2425":"pharaoh pursued them with his hosts  but they were submerged by the sea  which was destined to overwhelm them ","2426":"for pharaoh had led his people astray and did not guide them

things with which we have provided you but do not transgress  lest you should incur my wrath we said    he that incurs my wrath shall surely be ruined ","2429":"but i am most forgiving towards him who turns in repentance and believes and acts righteously and follows the right path  ","2430":" when moses was upon the mount  god said   o moses  why have you come with such haste from your people  ","2431":"he said   they are following in my footsteps  while i have hastened to you  my lord  to please you  ","2432":"but god said   we have tested your people in your absence the samiri has led them astray  ","2433":"moses returned to his people in anger and great sorrow he said   my people  did your lord not make you a handsome promise was my absence too long for you did you desire that your lord s wrath should descend upon you  when you broke your promise to me  ","2434":"they answered   we did not break our promise to you of our own accord  but we had to carry loads of the people s ornaments and so we threw them into the fire for that was what the samiri suggested  ","2435":"then he forged a calf for them    an image producing a lowing sound they said   this is your deity  the deity of moses  he has forgotten it  ","2436":"why did they not see that it could not give them any response and had no power to harm or benefit them ","2437":"aaron had already told them   o my people  you are only being tested by this your lord is the all merciful  so follow me and obey my command  ","2438":"they replied   we shall not cease to worship it until moses returns to us  ","2439":"moses said to aaron   what prevented you  when you saw that they had gone astray ","2440":"from following me why did you disobey my command  ","2441":"aaron said   son of my mother  do not seize me by my beard nor by my head i was afraid that you would say  you have caused dissension among the children of israel and did not pay heed to my words  ","2442":"moses said   what was the matter with you  samiri  ","2443":"he said   i perceived what they did not see so i took a handful of dust from the footprint of the messenger and threw it in the calf that is what my inner self prompted me to do  ","2444":"moses said   begone  it shall be your lot to say throughout your life   do not touch me   and you will be faced with a fate from which there will be no escape now look at your deity to which you have become so devoted  we shall burn it up  and then scatter it into the sea ","2445":"your only deity is god  there is no deity but him his knowledge encompasses all things  ","2446":"thus we relate to you the history of past events  and we have given you a reminder the quran from us ","2447":"whoever turns away from it will bear a heavy burden on the day of judgement ","2448":"which they shall bear forever it will be a grievous burden for them on the day of judgement ","2449":"the day when the trumpet shall be blown  we shall gather all the sinners on that day their eyes will turn blue with terror","2450":"and they shall murmur to one another   you stayed only ten days on the earth    ","2451":"we know best what they will say the most perceptive of them will say   you stayed only one day  ","2452":"they ask you about the mountains say   my lord will scatter them as dust","2453":"and leave the earth level and bare ","2454":"with neither hollows nor upthrust mounds to be seen ","2455":"on that day all will follow the summoning voice from which there is no escape  and all voices will be hushed before the lord of mercy  and nothing will be heard except a subdued murmur ","2456":"on that day no intercession will avail  except from one who has received the sanction of the merciful and of whose words he approves ","2457":"he knows what is before them and what is behind them  but they cannot encompass him with their knowledge ","2458":"on that day all faces shall be humbled before the living  self subsisting one those burdened with evil deeds will come to grief ","2459":"but he who does good works  being a believer  shall fear no harm nor any injustice  ","2460":"we have thus sent down the quran in arabic and given all kinds of warnings in it  so that they may fear god  or may take heed   ","2461":"exalted is god  the true king do not be impatient with the quran before its revelation is completed  and say   my lord  increase my knowledge  ","2462":"we made a covenant with adam before you  but he forgot  and we found him lacking in constancy ","2463":"when we said to the angels   prostrate yourselves before adam   they all prostrated themselves  except for satan  who refused ","2464":"we said   adam  satan is an enemy to you and to your wife let him not turn you both out of paradise and thus make you come to grief ","2465":"here you shall not go hungry or be naked ","2466":"you shall not thirst  nor feel the sun s heat  ","2467":"but satan whispered evil to him  saying   adam  shall i lead you to the tree of immortality and to a kingdom that never declines  ","2468":"they both ate the fruit of this tree  and so they became conscious of their nakedness and began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden thus adam disobeyed his lord and fell into error ","2469":"then his lord had mercy on him  accepted his repentance and guided him ","2470":"god said   go down  both of you  from here  as enemies to one another   if there comes to you guidance from me  then whoever follows my guidance will not lose his way  nor will he come to grief ","2471":"but whoever turns away from my reminder  will lead a straitened existence and on the day of judgement we shall raise him up blind","2472":"and he will ask   lord  why have you raised me up blind  while i possessed sight before  ","2473":"god will say   just as our signs came to you and you ignored them  so will you on this day be ignored  ","2474":"thus we shall reward the transgressor who denies the signs of his lord but the suffering of the life to come is more terrible and more lasting ","2475":"do they not learn a lesson from our destruction of many generations before them in whose dwelling places they walk about surely in this are signs for men of understanding ","2476":"but for a pre ordained word from your lord  and a term of respite already fixed  immediate punishment would inevitably have taken place ","2477":"so be patient with anything they may say and glorify your lord with his praise before the rising of the sun and before its setting  and glorify him in the hours of the night and at the beginning and end of the day  so that you may find comfort ","2478":"do not regard with envy the worldly benefits we have given some of them  for with these we seek only to test them the provision of your lord is better and more lasting ","2479":"bid your people say their prayers  and be constant in their observance we demand nothing from you it is we who provide for you  and the best end is that of righteousness ","2480":"they say   why does he not bring us a sign from his lord   have they not been given sufficient proof in previous scriptures ","2481":"if we had destroyed them with a punishment before this  they would have surely said   our lord  why did you not send to us a messenger so that we might have followed your commandment before we were humiliated and disgraced  ","2482":"say   everyone is waiting  so wait if you will you shall know who has followed the right path  and who has found guidance  ","2483":"the time of reckoning has drawn near for mankind  yet they are heedless and turn away ","2484":"whenever any fresh admonition comes to them from their lord  they listen to it  but do not take it seriously ","2485":"their hearts are distracted and forgetful the wrongdoers confer together secretly  saying   is not this man a mortal like you will you succumb to magic with your eyes open  ","2486":"say   my lord knows every word spoken in the heavens and on the earth he is all hearing  all knowing  ","2487":"some say   these are his confused dreams   others say   he has invented it himself   and yet others say   he is a poet let him bring us a sign as previous messengers did  ","2488":"before them  not one of the communities which we destroyed believed either will these believe ","2489":"the messengers we sent before you were but men whom we had sent revelations ask the people of the book if you do not know this   ","2490":"we did not give them bodies that needed no food  nor were they to live forever ","2491":"then we fulfilled our promise to them and we saved them and those with them whom we pleased  and we destroyed those who exceeded all bounds ","2492":"we have revealed a book to you which is admonition for you will you not then understand ","2493":"how many communities of evil doers we have destroyed  raising up other people after them ","2494":"when they felt our punishment coming upon them  they began to flee from it ","2495":"they were told   do not try to flee  but return to the comfort and luxuries in which you exulted and to the places where you lived  so that you may be questioned  ","2496":"they said   woe to us  we were indeed wrongdoers  ","2497":"and this they kept repeating until we caused them to become like a field mowed down  and reduced to ashes ","2498":"it was not in play that we created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them ","2499":"had we wished to find a pastime  we would surely have found it in that which is with us  if such had been our will ","2500":"we will hurl the truth at falsehood  the falsehood shall be crushed and will disappear woe to you for what you utter ","2501":"to him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and on the earth and those that are with him are never too proud to worship him  nor do they grow weary ","2502":"they glorify him night and day without tiring ","2503":"have they taken deities from the earth who can bring the dead to life ","2504":"if there had been in the heavens and on the earth  other deities besides god  both the heavens and earth would be ruined god  lord of the throne  is far above that which they ascribe to him ","2505":"none shall question him about his works  but they shall be questioned ","2506":"have they taken other deities besides him say to them   bring your proofs this is the reminder of those who are with me and the reminder of those who were before me   but most of them do not know the truth  and so they turn away from it ","2507":"we sent all messengers before you with this revelation   there is no deity save me  so worship me alone  ","2508":"they say   the all merciful has taken a son   glory be to him  they are only his honoured servants ","2509":"they do not try to speak ahead of him  and they act at his command ","2510":"he knows what is before them and what is behind them  and they cannot intercede without his permission indeed they themselves stand in awe of him ","2511":"whoever of them should say   i am a deity besides him   shall be requited with hell thus do we reward the wrongdoers ","2512":"do not those who deny the truth see that the heavens and the earth were joined together and that we then split them asunder and that we have made every living thing out of water will they still not believe ","2513":"we set firm mountains upon the earth lest it should sway under them  and we placed therein passages for paths so that they might find their way ","2514":"we have made the heaven a well secured canopy  yet still they turn away from our signs

the truth see you  they laugh at you  saying   is this the one who talks of your deities   yet it is they who deny all mention of the gracious one ","2519":"man is a creature of haste soon i will show you my signs  but do not ask me to hasten them ","2520":"they ask   when will this promise be fulfilled  if what you say be true  ","2521":"if only those who deny the truth knew the time when they would not be able to ward off the fire neither from their faces nor from their backs they will not be helped ","2522":"indeed  it will come upon them suddenly and confound them  and they will not be able to ward it off  nor shall they be reprieved ","2523":"other messengers have been mocked before you  but those who scoffed were overwhelmed by the very thing they had mocked ","2524":"say   who will save you from the wrath of the most gracious  by night and by day   yet they turn away from the remembrance of their lord ","2525":"do they have other deities who can defend them against us they cannot even help themselves  neither can they be aided against us ","2526":"yet we bestowed the good things of life upon their fathers for a great length of time but do they not see how we are

righteous ","2531":"those who fear their lord in the unseen  also dread the hour of judgement ","2532":"this is a blessed reminder that we have revealed to you will you then reject it ","2533":"before

","2544":"they said   abraham  was it you who did this to our deities  ","2545":"he answered   rather this biggest one of them did it ask them  if they can speak  ","2546":"then they turned to one another and said   it is you yourselves who are in the wrong  ","2547":"then they hung their heads  and said   o abraham  you know they cannot speak  ","2548":"abraham said   so  do you worship something instead of god that can neither benefit you nor harm you ","2549":"shame on you and on whatever you worship instead of god can you not understand  ","2550":"they said   burn him and help

believe ","3255":"pharaoh behaved arrogantly in the land  and divided the people into groups  seeking to weaken one section  slaying their sons and sparing their daughters  he was one of those who spread corruption ","3256":"we wished to favour those who were oppressed in the land  and to make them leaders and make them inheritors of our bounties  ","3257":"and to give them power in the land  and to show pharaoh and haman and their hosts that very thing which they feared ","3258":"we inspired moses mother saying   suckle him  and then  when you fear for him  cast him into the river  and have no fear and do not grieve  for we shall return him to you  and shall make him one of the messengers  ","3259":"then pharaoh s household picked him up    later to become for them an enemy and a source of grief for them  pharaoh and haman and their hosts were wrongdoers   ","3260":"and pharaoh s wife said   he will be a joy to the eye for me and you  do not slay him  he may well be of use to us  or we may adopt him as a son   they did not realize what they were doing ","3261":"moses mother s heart was full of anxiety    she would have disclosed his identity had we not strengthened her heart so that she might be a firm believer in our promise ","3262":"she said to moses sister   go  and follow him   so she watched him from a distance  like a stranger  without anyone noticing her ","3263":"we had already made him refuse all wet nurses so his sister said to them   shall i tell you of a family who will bring him up for you and take good care of him  ","3264":"thus we restored him to his mother  so that she might be comforted and not grieve any more  and so that she would know that god s promise was true but most of them do not realize this ","3265":"when moses reached full manhood and maturity  we bestowed upon him wisdom and knowledge  this is how we reward those who do good ","3266":"he entered the city unnoticed by its people  and there he encountered two men fighting with one another    one of his own people and the other one of his enemies the one who belonged to his own people cried out to him for help against his foe    whereupon moses struck him down with his fist  thereby causing his death moses said   this is satan s doing  he is an open foe  leading man astray  ","3267":"he prayed   forgive me lord  for i have sinned against my soul   god forgave him  for he is the forgiving one  the merciful ","3268":"he said   my lord  because of the favour that you have shown me  i vow that i will never be a helper of the guilty  ","3269":"the next morning  when he was walking in the city  apprehensive  and watchful  and the man who had sought his help the day before cried out to him again for help moses said to him   you are clearly a misguided man  ","3270":"when he wanted to catch the one who was an enemy to them both  the man said   moses  do you want to kill me just as you killed a man yesterday you only want to become a tyrant in the land  you do not want to set things right  ","3271":"a man came running from the far side of the city  and said   moses  the authorities are conspiring to kill you  so leave the city i am one of your well wishers  ","3272":"so moses departed from the city  fearful and vigilant  and prayed   my lord  save me from these unjust people  ","3273":"when he made his way towards midian  he said   i am sure  my lord will guide me to the right way  ","3274":"and when he arrived at the well of midian  he found around it a group of men watering their flocks  and he saw two women standing apart from them  who were holding back their flocks  so he asked   what is the matter with you   they replied   we cannot draw water until the shepherds take away their sheep our father is a very old man  ","3275":"so moses watered their flocks for them  and returned into the shade and prayed   lord  i am truly in need of whatever blessing you may send down for me  ","3276":"and then one of the two women came walking shyly up to him and said   my father is asking you to come so that he may reward you for watering our flocks for us   when moses came to their father and gave him an account of himself  he said   don t be afraid  you have escaped from those wrongdoing people  ","3277":"one of the girls said   father  hire him  for the best man to hire is someone strong and trustworthy  ","3278":"the father said   i would like to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine on the condition that you stay eight years in my service but if you wish it  you may stay ten i do not want to impose any hardship on you god willing  you will find me a fair person  ","3279":"moses said   that is agreed between me and you  whichever of the two terms i fulfil  there will be no blame on me god is witness to what we say  ","3280":"when moses completed the term and set out with his family  he noticed a fire in the direction of mount tur he said to his family   stay here  i can see a fire perhaps i can bring you news  or a burning brand from the fire with which you may warm yourself  ","3281":"and when he came to it  he was called by a voice from a bush in a blessed spot  on the right side of the valley   o moses  i am god  lord of the universe ","3282":"throw down your staff   and when he saw it move as though it were a serpent  he turned his back and fled  and did not look back  o moses   said the voice   come forward and have no fear  you are quite safe ","3283":"put your hand into your bosom  it will come out shining white  without blemish  now draw your arm close to your body to calm your fears these are two credentials from your lord for pharaoh and his nobles surely  they are a rebellious people  ","3284":"moses said   my lord  i have killed one of their people and fear that they may kill me ","3285":"my brother aaron is more eloquent than i am send him with me to support me and back me up for i fear that they will reject me  ","3286":"god said   we shall strengthen your arm through your brother  we shall give you both power  so that they shall not be able to harm you set forth with our signs you  and those who follow you  will surely prevail  ","3287":"when moses came to them with our clear signs  they said   this is nothing but contrived magic we never heard of this among our forefathers  ","3288":"and moses replied   my lord knows best who comes with guidance from him and who will attain the heavenly abode in the hereafter the wrongdoers shall never prosper  ","3289":"pharaoh said   o nobles  i know of no god for you other than myself so  haman  burn me bricks of clay  and build me a high tower  so that i may have a look at the god of moses  though i consider him to be one of the liars  ","3290":"he and his hosts behaved arrogantly in the land without any justification  thinking that they would not be recalled to us ","3291":"so we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea consider the fate of the wrongdoers ","3292":"we had made them leaders  but they called people to the fire  and on the day of judgement they will not be helped ","3293":"we have caused a curse to follow them in this world and  on the day of judgement  they will be among the wretched ","3294":"after we had destroyed the earlier generations  we gave moses the book to give men insight  and as guidance and a blessing for people  so that they might take heed ","3295":"you were not present on the western side of the mount when we gave our command to moses  nor were you among the witnesses ","3296":"we brought into being many generations who lived long lives  nor did you live among the people of midian and recite our revelations to them  it is we who send messengers ","3297":"you were not on the side of the mount when we called out to moses  but we have sent you as a mercy from your lord  so that you may warn people to whom no warner has been sent before you  so that they may take heed ","3298":"and may not say  if an affliction should befall them on account of their misdeeds   lord  if only you had sent us a messenger  we might have followed your message and become believers  ","3299":"but when the truth came to them from us  they said   why has he not been given the like of what moses was given   but did they not reject what moses was given before they said   both moses and muhammad are kinds of sorcery  each assisting the other   and they add   we reject both of them  ","3300":"say to them   bring down from god a scripture that is a better guide than these two and i will follow it  if what you say be true  ","3301":"if they do not respond to you  then know that they follow only their own desires who could be more astray than he who follows his own likes and dislikes with no guidance from god god does not guide the evil doers ","3302":"we have conveyed our word to them  in succession  so that they may give heed ","3303":"those to whom we gave the book before this believe in it the quran  ","3304":"and  when it is recited to them  they say   we believe in it indeed it is the truth from our lord even before it came  we had submitted ourselves  ","3305":"such people as these will receive a double reward  because they are steadfast and repel evil with good  and give alms out of what we have given them ","3306":"and when they hear vain talk  they turn away from it and say   we have our actions and you have yours we wish you peace we will have nothing to do with the ignorant  ","3307":"you cannot guide whoever you please  it is god who guides whom he will he best knows those who would accept guidance ","3308":"they say   if we were to follow your guidance  we should be uprooted from our land   but have we not established for them a safe haven to which fruits of every kind are brought as a provision from ourself but most of them have no knowledge ","3309":"how many townships have we destroyed where the people had become arrogant on account of their affluence since then their dwelling places have scarcely been inhabited    we became their inheritors ","3310":"your lord would never destroy a people until he had sent messengers to their capital cities  reciting to them our revelations nor did we destroy a town unless their people became wrongdoers ","3311":"whatever you are given in this life is nothing but a temporary provision of this life and its glitter  what god has is better and more lasting will you not then understand ","3312":"can someone to whom we have made a gracious promise and who will see it fulfilled  be compared to someone we have allowed to enjoy a worldly life  awhile  and who will be brought up before god for his accounting on the day of resurrection ","3313":"on that day he will call to them  and say   where are those whom you claimed to be my partners  ","3314":"and those on whom sentence has been passed  will say   our lord  these are the ones who led us astray we led them astray as we ourselves were led astray we now dissociate

","3720":"they said   our lord knows that we have been sent to you ","3721":"and our duty is only to convey the message to you clearly  ","3722":"but they answered   we see an evil omen in you if you do not stop  we shall certainly stone you  and you will suffer a painful punishment at our hands  ","3723":"they said   your evil augury be with you  is it because you are admonished about the truth surely  you are a people transgressing all bounds  ","3724":"then  from the furthest part of the city  a man came running he said   my people  follow the messengers ","3725":"follow those who ask no

ones  ","3732":"after him we did not send down against his people a host from heaven  nor do we send down such hosts ","3733":"it was but one great blast and they fell down lifeless ","3734":"alas for human beings  they ridicule every messenger that comes to them ","3735":"do they not see how many generations we have destroyed before them never shall they return to them ","3736":"all of them  gathered together  will certainly be brought before us ","3737":"there is a sign for them in the lifeless earth we revive it and we produce grain from it of which they eat ","3738":"we have placed in

until finally it becomes like an old date stalk ","3744":"the sun cannot overtake the moon  nor can the night outpace the day  each floats in its own orbit ","3745":"another sign for them is that we carried their offspring in the laden ark ","3746":"we have created for them the like of it in which they ride ","3747":"if it were our will  we could drown them  then there would be no helper to hear

behind you  in order that you may be shown mercy   they turn away ","3750":"indeed  not one of your lord s signs comes to them without their turning away from it ","3751":"and when they are told   give to others out of what god has provided for you   those who are bent on denying the truth say to the believers   why should we feed those whom god could feed if he wanted you are clearly in error

lord ","3756":"woe betide us  they will say   who has roused us from our sleep   this is what the lord of mercy promised  the messengers spoke the truth ","3757":"it will be but one blast  and they will all be brought before us together ","3758":"on that day no soul shall suffer the least injustice you shall be rewarded only according to your deeds ","3759":"the people of paradise shall be

against the deniers ","3775":"do they not see that  among the things which our hands have fashioned  we have created for them cattle of which they are the masters ","3776":"we have subjected these to them  so that some may be used for riding and some for food ","3777":"some for milk to drink and some from which other benefits may be received will they not be grateful ","3778":"they have set up other gods besides god  hoping to be helped by them ","3779":"but they are not able to help them  rather they will be brought before god as their allied host ","3780":"let not their words grieve you we have knowledge of all that they conceal and all that they reveal ","3781":"does not man see that we created him from a drop yet there he is  flagrantly contentious ","3782":"producing arguments

who has control over all things it is to him that you will all be brought back ","3788":"by those angels who range themselves in close ranks","3789":"and those who drive away the wicked with reproof","3790":"and by the reciters of the reminder ","3791":"your god is one ","3792":"lord of the heavens and the earth and everything between them  lord of the easts ","3793":"we have adorned the lowest heaven with the beauty of the planets ","3794":"and guarded it against all rebellious devils ","3795":"they cannot overhear the higher assembly for they are pelted from every side ","3796":"driven away  and will suffer eternal punishment ","3797":"but if anyone does succeed in snatching a glimpse of such knowledge   he shall be pursued by a piercing flame ","3798":"so  ask those who deny the truth if it was harder to create them than all the other things we have created we created them from sticky clay ","3799":"no wonder you are surprised as they laugh with scorn ","3800":"when they are reminded  they do not pay heed ","3801":"and whenever they see some sign  they ridicule it ","3802":"saying   this is plain sorcery  ","3803":"what  when we have died and

","3823":"and replied   shall we then give up our deities at the bidding of a mad poet  ","3824":"surely  he has brought the truth  confirming those who were sent before ","3825":"you shall surely taste the painful punishment ","3826":"and be rewarded only according to your deeds  ","3827":"but the chosen servants of god ","3828":"shall have a known provision   ","3829":"fruits of various kinds

","3846":"except for our first death are we not going to be punished ","3847":"truly  this is a great victory  ","3848":"it is for the like of this that all should strive ","3849":"is that better by way of hospitality or the zaqqum tree ","3850":"which we have made as a test for the wrongdoers ","3851":"for it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of hellfire ","3852":"and its fruits are like devils heads ","3853":"they will eat from it and fill their bellies with it ","3854":"then in addition to it they shall have a draught of boiling water to drink ","3855":"then surely they shall return to hell ","3856":"they found their fathers had gone astray ","3857":"so they are rushing to follow in their footsteps ","3858":"and assuredly many of the ancients went astray before them

turned to their gods and said   do you not eat ","3879":"what is the matter with you that you do not speak  ","3880":"then he turned on them  striking them down with his right hand ","3881":"his people came rushing towards him ","3882":"but he said   how can you worship things you carve with your own hands ","3883":"when it is god who has created you and all your handiwork  ","3884":"they said   build a pyre for him and throw him into the blaze  ","3885":"they wanted to harm him  but we humiliated them all ","3886":"he said   i will go to my lord  he is sure to guide me ","3887":"lord

touched him  he is sure to say   this is my due i do not think that the hour is going to come and even if i return to my lord  he will surely reward me well   but truly we shall tell those who deny

watching them and you are not a guardian over them ","4278":"thus we revealed to you  this arabic quran so that you may warn the mother of cities makkah and those around it  and warn them of the day of gathering which is sure to come  when some group will be in the garden  and some will be in the fire ","4279":"had god so willed  he could have made all of them one community  but he admits into

moses and jesus  so that you should remain steadfast in religion and not become divided in it what you call upon the polytheists to do is hard for them  god chooses for himself whoever he pleases and guides towards himself those who turn to him ","4285":"they became divided only after knowledge had reached them  out of mutual jealousy had it not been for a decree already passed by your lord  to reprieve them till a specified period  the matter would surely have been decided between them those who inherited the book after them are indeed in grave doubt  amounting to suspicion about it

gracious to his creatures  he provides sustenance for whoever he wills    for he alone is the powerful one  the almighty ","4291":"to him who desires a harvest in the life to come  we shall grant an increase in his harvest  whereas to him who desires but a harvest in this world  we may give something thereof    but he will have no share in the blessings of the life to come ","4292":"do they have

servants who believe and do righteous deeds say   i do not ask of you any reward for it  except that i am inviting you to god because of love of kinship   whoever earns a good deed  we shall increase its good for him  god is most forgiving  most appreciative ","4295":"do they say   he has invented a lie about god  if god so willed  he could seal your heart god wipes out falsehood and vindicates the truth by his words he has full knowledge of what is in men s hearts   ","4296":"he accepts repentance from his servants and pardons their sins he knows everything you do ","4297":"he responds to those who believe and do good deeds  and gives them more of his bounty  agonizing torment awaits the deniers of the truth ","4298":"if god were to grant his abundant provision to all his creatures  they would act insolently on earth  but he sends down in due measure whatever he will  for he is well aware of his servants and watchful over them ","4299":"it is he who sends rain after they have despaired and spreads his mercy far and wide he is the protector  worthy of all praise ","4300":"among his signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and all the living creatures he has dispersed

standstill and they would lie motionless on the surface of the sea  truly there are signs in this for anyone who is steadfast and grateful ","4305":"or he may cause them to founder because of people s misdeeds  he pardons many of them ","4306":"those who dispute our signs shall learn that they have no escape ","4307":"whatever you have been given is only a temporary provision of this life  but that which is with god is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their lord ","4308":"who refrain from heinous sins and gross indecencies  who forgive when they are angry

after they have been wronged cannot be held blameworthy ","4313":"blame falls only on those who wrong men and transgress on this earth without justification  such will have a painful punishment ","4314":"whoever is patient and forgiving  acts with great courage and resolution ","4315":"anyone whom god lets go astray will thereafter have no protector whatsoever  you will see the wrongdoers  when they face the punishment  exclaiming   is there no way back  ","4316":"you will see them exposed to the fire  abject in humiliation  glancing furtively at it  while those who believed will say   the losers are those ones who have forfeited their souls and their people on the day of resurrection   truly  the wrongdoers will remain in everlasting torment ","4317":"they will have no allies to help them against god  there is no way forward for those whom god lets go astray ","4318":"respond to your lord before a day arrives that will not be averted against god s will you will not find any refuge from god on that day  nor will you have any opportunity to deny your sins ","4319":"now if they turn away  we have not sent you o prophet as their keeper  your responsibility is only to convey the message man is such that when we let him taste our mercy  he exults in it  but if an evil befalls him which is his own doing  he becomes utterly ungrateful ","4320":"god has control of the heavens

transgression ","4330":"we have sent many a prophet to earlier peoples","4331":"but whenever a prophet came to them  they mocked him ","4332":"so we destroyed those who were mightier than these  such was the example of the earlier peoples ","4333":"if you ask them   who has created the heavens and the earth    they will surely answer   the almighty  the all knowing one has created them  ","4334":"who has made the earth a cradle for you and made thereon paths for you so that  hopefully  you may find your way","4335":"it is he who sends water down from the sky in due measure  we revive
