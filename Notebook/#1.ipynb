       "'and worship your lord until what is certain death comes to you the decree of god is at hand  so do not seek to hasten it holy is he  and exalted far above what they associate with him he sends down the angels with revelations by his command to whoever of his servants he pleases  saying   warn mankind that there is no god save me  so fear me  he created the heavens and the earth for a true purpose he is exalted above anything they associate with him he created man out of a mere drop of sperm  yet he shows himself to be openly contentious he has created cattle for you  from them you derive food and clothing and numerous other benefits how pleasant they look when you bring them home in the evenings and when you take them out to pasture in the mornings they carry your loads to places which you could otherwise not reach without great hardship  surely  your lord is compassionate and merciful he has created horses  mules and donkeys  so that you may ride them  and also so that they may be put on show  and he creates other things beyond your knowledge the straight way leads to god and there are ways which deviate from the right course if he so wished  he would guide you all it is he who sends down water from the sky from it you drink and with it trees grow on which you pasture your cattle and with it he grows for you corn  and the olive and the date palm and the grape  and all kinds of fruits surely  in that is a sign for a people who reflect he has made the night and the day and the sun and the moon subservient to you  and all the stars are subservient to his command surely in this there are signs for men of understanding on the earth he has fashioned for you objects of various hues  there is certainly a sign in that for people who pay heed it is he who subjected to you the sea  so that you may eat its fresh seafood and bring forth from it ornaments to wear you see the ships cleaving through it all this  so that you may seek his bounty and feel grateful he has set up on the earth firm mountains  lest it shake under you  and rivers and tracks  so that you may find your way and he has set up other landmarks by these and by the stars people set their course is he  then  who creates like him who does not create will you not  then  take heed if you tried to count god s blessings  you would never be able to number them god is ever forgiving and most merciful god knows all that you conceal and all that you reveal those you call on besides god cannot create anything they are themselves created they are dead  not living  nor do they know when they will be raised to life your god is the one god as for those who do not believe in the hereafter  their hearts refuse to admit the truth and they are arrogant god surely knows what they conceal and what they reveal he does not love the arrogant when they are asked   what is it that your lord has sent down   they say   stories of the ancients  let them bear all their own burdens on resurrection day as well as some of the burdens of those whom they lead astray without any knowledge how evil the load with which they shall be burdened those who went before them also plotted but god struck at the foundations of their building  and the roof fell down upon them from above the punishment came upon them from where they did not expect then on the day of resurrection he will disgrace them  and say   where are my partners for whose sake you opposed my guidance   those given knowledge will say   this day humiliation and affliction will surely befall those who have been denying the truth  those whose lives the angels take while they are wronging their own souls will offer submission saying   we were not doing anything evil    indeed   the angels will reply   god is aware of what you have been doing so enter the gates of hell there you shall abide forever   evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant when those who fear god are asked   what has your lord sent down   their reply is   goodness   the reward of those who do good works in this world is good  but the abode of the hereafter is even better the home of the righteous is indeed excellent they will enter gardens of eternity  where rivers will flow at their feet there they will have all that they wish for thus god rewards the righteous those whose lives the angels take in a state of purity  saying to them    peace be on you  enter the garden  because of the good which you did in the world  are they waiting for the angels to come to them  or the fulfillment of your lord s will those who went before them did the same god did not wrong them  rather they wronged themselves the evil results of their deeds overtook them  and that which they used to mock at encompassed them those who associate others with god say   if god had so willed we would not have worshipped anything besides him  neither we nor our fathers  nor would we have forbidden anything without his sanction   so did those who went before them the duty of the messengers is only to convey the message clearly we raised among every people a messenger who enjoined   worship god alone and shun the evil one   then among them were some whom god guided and among them were others who became deserving of ruin so travel across the earth and observe what was the end of those who rejected the messengers though you prophet may be eager to guide them  god does not guide those whom he lets go astray  because of their refusal to give a positive response to the truth they will have no supporters they swear their strongest oaths by god that god will never raise the dead to life    nonetheless  it is a promise truly binding on him  even though most people do not realize it   this is so that he may make clear to them what they have differed about and so that those who are bent on denying the truth may realize that they were lying when we will something to happen  all that we say is   be   and it is as for those who  after persecution  migrated from their homes for the cause of god  we will provide them with a goodly abode in this life  but truly the reward of the hereafter will be greater  if they only knew it they are the ones who are steadfast and put their trust in their lord before you also the messengers we sent were but mortal men to whom we vouchsafed revelation ask the people of the book  if you do not know  we sent them with clear signs and scriptures we have sent down the reminder to you  to enable you to make clear to mankind what has been sent down to them  so that they may reflect upon it do those who devise evil plans feel secure that god will not make them sink into the land  or that a punishment will not come upon them from where they least expect or that he will not seize them suddenly in their daily activities and they will not be able to frustrate him or that he will not punish them by giving them a fright indeed  your lord is kind and merciful have they not observed the things god has created  casting their shadows right and left  prostrating themselves before god in all humility everything in the heavens and all the creatures on the earth prostrate themselves before god  as do the angels  and they do not behave proudly they fear their lord above them  and do what they are commanded god says   do not take two gods he is only one god so fear me alone  to him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth  and obedience is due to him alone will you then fear anyone other than god whatever blessing you have is from god  and to him you turn for help when distress befalls you yet no sooner does he relieve your distress than some among you set up other partners besides their lord showing no gratitude for what we have given them enjoy yourselves awhile  but soon you will know they even appoint a share of what we have provided for them to false gods they know nothing of you shall surely be questioned about the lies you have been fabricating they assign daughters to god  glory be to him   but for themselves sons that they desire to have when the birth of a girl is announced to any of them  his face darkens and he is filled with gloom in his shame he hides himself away from his people  because of the bad news he has been given should he keep her and feel disgraced or bury her in the dust how ill they judge the attribute of evil applies to those who do not believe in the hereafter  while to god applies the highest attribute  for he is mighty  the wise if god were to take people to task for their wrongdoing  he would not leave even one living creature on earth  but he gives them respite till an appointed time  when their time comes they cannot delay it for an hour  nor can they bring it forward they attribute to god what they themselves dislike and their tongues utter the lie that all good things are for themselves without doubt  the fire awaits them  and they shall be hastened on into it by god  we have sent messengers before you to other nations but satan made their foul deeds seem fair to them and today he is their patron they shall have a painful punishment we have only sent down the book to you so that you can make clear to them that concerning which they differ  and as a guidance and a mercy to people who believe god sends down water from the sky and with it revives the earth when it is dead there is truly a sign in this for people who listen there is also a lesson for you in cattle from the contents of their bellies  from between the dung and blood  we give you pure milk to drink  pleasant for those who drink it  from the fruit of the date palm and the grapes you derive intoxicants as well as wholesome food surely in this there is a sign for men of understanding your lord inspired the bee  saying   make your homes in the mountains  in the trees  and also in the structures which men erect then feed on every kind of fruit  and follow the trodden paths of your lord   from its belly comes a drink with different colours which provides healing for mankind indeed  in this there is a sign for people who give thought god created you  then he shall cause you to die  and some shall have their lives prolonged to abject old age  ceasing to know anything after once having had knowledge god is all knowing and powerful god has given some of you more provision than others those who have been given more are unwilling to pass their provision to the servants they possess so that they become their equals will they then deny the favour of god god has given you wives from among yourselves  and given you children and grandchildren from your wives  and provided wholesome things for you will they then believe in falsehood and deny god s favours they worship  instead of god  things that have no control over their provision from the heavens or the earth in any way  nor do they have any power to do so do not compare god with anyone god has knowledge  but you have not god makes a comparison between an owned slave possessing no power over anything  and someone to whom we have given plentiful provision  who gives out from it privately and openly are they equal praise be to god  but most people do not know it god makes another comparison between two men  one of whom is dumb and cannot do a thing  and is a burden on his master wherever he sends him on an errand  he brings him no good is he equal to someone who commands justice and is on a straight path god alone has knowledge of the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth  and the coming of the hour of judgement is like the twinkling of an eye  or even quicker surely god has full power over everything god brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers while you knew nothing  and gave you hearing and sight and hearts  so that you might be grateful do they not see the birds held poised in the vault of heaven nothing holds them up except god truly  there are signs in this for those who believe god has made your houses places of rest for you and made tents for you out of cattle hides  which are light for you to carry  both when you are travelling and when you are staying in one place he provides for you from the wool and fur and hair of cattle  household goods and articles for use for a time god has granted you shade out of what he has created  places of shelter in the mountains  garments with which to protect yourselves from the heat and coats of mail to shield you in battle thus he completes his favour to you  so that you may submit wholly to him but if they turn away  you are responsible only for conveying the message clearly they recognize the favour of god  yet they deny it  and most of them are ungrateful on the day when we raise up a witness from every people  those who were bent on denying the truth will not be permitted to put forward excuses  or to make amends when the wrongdoers face their punishment  it shall not be lightened for them  nor shall they be granted any reprieve when those who associate partners with god see their associate gods  they will say   our lord  these are our associate gods whom we used to call upon instead of you   but they will throw back their words at them  saying    indeed you are liars  and on that day they will offer total submission to god  and all that they used to devise will fail them upon all who were bent on denying the truth and who turned others away from the path of god  we will heap punishment upon punishment  in return for all the corruption that they brought about the day will come when we raise up in every people a witness against them from amongst themselves  and we will bring you as a witness against these people we have sent down the book to you to make everything clear  a guidance  and a mercy  and glad tidings for those who submit to god god commands justice  kindness and giving their due to near relatives  and he forbids all shameful deeds  and injustice and transgression he admonishes you so that you may take heed fulfill the covenant of god when you have made one  and do not break your pledges after their confirmation indeed you have made god your surety  for god knows all that you do do not  like the woman who unravels her yarn after its strands have been firmly spun  use your oaths as a means of deceiving one another  just because one community could become bigger than another god is only testing you by means of this on the day of resurrection he will make it clear to you what you differed about had god pleased  he would have united you in one community  but he lets go astray whoever he will  and guides whoever he will  and you will surely be called upon to account for all your actions do not use your oaths to deceive each other lest any foot should slip after being firmly placed and lest you should taste the penalty for having hindered others from the path of god  for then you will have a terrible punishment do not sell god s covenant for a paltry price what is with god is better for you if you only knew what you have shall pass away  but what is with god is lasting we will certainly give those who are patient their reward according to the best of their actions to whoever does good deeds  man or woman  and is a believer  we shall assuredly give a good life  and we will bestow upon them their reward according to the best of their works when you read the quran  seek god s protection from satan  the rejected one '"

they even appoint a share of what we have provided for them to false gods they know nothing of you shall surely be questioned about the lies you have been fabricating they assign daughters to god  glory be to him   but for themselves sons that they desire to have when the birth of a girl is announced to any of them  his face darkens and he is filled with gloom in his shame he hides himself away from his people  because of the bad news he has been given should he keep her and feel disgraced or bury her in the dust how ill they judge the attribute of evil applies to those who do not believe in the hereafter  while to god applies the highest attribute  for he is mighty  the wise if god were to take people to task for their wrongdoing  he would not leave even one living creature on earth  but he gives them respite till an appointed time  when their time comes they cannot delay it for an hour  nor can they bring it forward they attribute to god what they themselves dislike and their tongues utter the lie that all good things are for themselves without doubt  the fire awaits them  and they shall be hastened on into it by god  we have sent messengers before you to other nations but satan made their foul deeds seem fair to them and today he is their patron they shall have a painful punishment we have only sent down the book to you so that you can make clear to them that concerning which they differ  and as a guidance and a mercy to people who believe god sends down water from the sky and with it revives the earth when it is dead there is truly a sign in this for people who listen there is also a lesson for you in cattle from the contents of their bellies  from between the dung and blood  we give you pure milk to drink  pleasant for those who drink it  from the fruit of the date palm and the grapes you derive intoxicants as well as wholesome food surely in this there is a sign for men of understanding your lord inspired the bee  saying   make your homes in the mountains  in the trees  and also in the structures which men erect then feed on every kind of fruit  and follow the trodden paths of your lord   from its belly comes a drink with different colours which provides healing for mankind indeed  in this there is a sign for people who give thought god created you  then he shall cause you to die  and some shall have their lives prolonged to abject old age  ceasing to know anything after once having had knowledge god is all knowing and powerful god has given some of you more provision than others those who have been given more are unwilling to pass their provision to the servants they possess so that they become their equals will they then deny the favour of god god has given you wives from among yourselves  and given you children and grandchildren from your wives  and provided wholesome things for you will they then believe in falsehood and deny god s favours they worship  instead of god  things that have no control over their provision from the heavens or the earth in any way  nor do they have any power to do so do not compare god with anyone god has knowledge  but you have not god makes a comparison between an owned slave possessing no power over anything  and someone to whom we have given plentiful provision  who gives out from it privately and openly are they equal praise be to god  but most people do not know it god makes another comparison between two men  one of whom is dumb and cannot do a thing  and is a burden on his master wherever he sends him on an errand  he brings him no good is he equal to someone who commands justice and is on a straight path god alone has knowledge of the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth  and the coming of the hour of judgement is like the twinkling of an eye  or even quicker surely god has full power over everything god brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers while you knew nothing  and gave you hearing and sight and hearts  so that you might be grateful do they not see the birds held poised in the vault of heaven nothing holds them up except god truly  there are signs in this for those who believe god has made your houses places of rest for you and made tents for you out of cattle hides  which are light for you to carry  both when you are travelling and when you are staying in one place he provides for you from the wool and fur and hair of cattle  household goods and articles for use for a time god has granted you shade out of what he has created  places of shelter in the mountains  garments with which to protect yourselves from the heat and coats of mail to shield you in battle thus he completes his favour to you  so that you may submit wholly to him but if they turn away  you are responsible only for conveying the message clearly they recognize the favour of god  yet they deny it  and most of them are ungrateful on the day when we raise up a witness from every people  those who were bent on denying the truth will not be permitted to put forward excuses  or to make amends when the wrongdoers face their punishment  it shall not be lightened for them  nor shall they be granted any reprieve when those who associate partners with god see their associate gods  they will say   our lord  these are our associate gods whom we used to call upon instead of you   but they will throw back their words at them  saying    indeed you are liars  and on that day they will offer total submission to god  and all that they used to devise will fail them upon all who were bent on denying the truth and who turned others away from the path of god  we will heap punishment upon punishment  in return for all the corruption that they brought about the day will come when we raise up in every people a witness against them from amongst themselves  and we will bring you as a witness against these people we have sent down the book to you to make everything clear  a guidance  and a mercy  and glad tidings for those who submit to god god commands justice  kindness and giving their due to near relatives  and he forbids all shameful deeds  and injustice and transgression he admonishes you so that you may take heed fulfill the covenant of god when you have made one  and do not break your pledges after their confirmation indeed you have made god your surety  for god knows all that you do do not  like the woman who unravels her yarn after its strands have been firmly spun  use your oaths as a means of deceiving one another  just because one community could become bigger than another god is only testing you by means of this on the day of resurrection he will make it clear to you what you differed about had god pleased  he would have united you in one community  but he lets go astray whoever he will  and guides whoever he will  and you will surely be called upon to account for all your actions do not use your oaths to deceive each other lest any foot should slip after being firmly placed and lest you should taste the penalty for having hindered others from the path of god  for then you will have a terrible punishment do not sell god s covenant for a paltry price what is with god is better for you if you only knew what you have shall pass away  but what is with god is lasting we will certainly give those who are patient their reward according to the best of their actions to whoever does good deeds  man or woman  and is a believer  we shall assuredly give a good life  and we will bestow upon them their reward according to the best of their works when you read the quran  seek god s protection from satan  the rejected one '"

      "and worship your lord until what is certain death comes to you the decree of god is at hand  so do not seek to hasten it holy is he  and exalted far above what they associate with him he sends down the angels with revelations by his command to whoever of his servants he pleases  saying   warn mankind that there is no god save me  so fear me  he created the heavens and the earth for a true purpose he is exalted above anything they associate with him he created man out of a mere drop of sperm  yet he shows himself to be openly contentious he has created cattle for you  from them you derive food and clothing and numerous other benefits how pleasant they look when you bring them home in the evenings and when you take them out to pasture in the mornings they carry your loads to places which you could otherwise not reach without great hardship  surely  your lord is compassionate and merciful he has created horses  mules and donkeys  so that you may ride them  and also so that they may be put on show  and he creates other things beyond your knowledge the straight way leads to god and there are ways which deviate from the right course if he so wished  he would guide you all it is he who sends down water from the sky from it you drink and with it trees grow on which you pasture your cattle and with it he grows for you corn  and the olive and the date palm and the grape  and all kinds of fruits surely  in that is a sign for a people who reflect he has made the night and the day and the sun and the moon subservient to you  and all the stars are subservient to his command surely in this there are signs for men of understanding on the earth he has fashioned for you objects of various hues  there is certainly a sign in that for people who pay heed it is he who subjected to you the sea  so that you may eat its fresh seafood and bring forth from it ornaments to wear you see the ships cleaving through it all this  so that you may seek his bounty and feel grateful he has set up on the earth firm mountains  lest it shake under you  and rivers and tracks  so that you may find your way and he has set up other landmarks by these and by the stars people set their course is he  then  who creates like him who does not create will you not  then  take heed if you tried to count god s blessings  you would never be able to number them god is ever forgiving and most merciful god knows all that you conceal and all that you reveal those you call on besides god cannot create anything they are themselves created they are dead  not living  nor do they know when they will be raised to life your god is the one god as for those who do not believe in the hereafter  their hearts refuse to admit the truth and they are arrogant god surely knows what they conceal and what they reveal he does not love the arrogant when they are asked   what is it that your lord has sent down   they say   stories of the ancients  let them bear all their own burdens on resurrection day as well as some of the burdens of those whom they lead astray without any knowledge how evil the load with which they shall be burdened those who went before them also plotted but god struck at the foundations of their building  and the roof fell down upon them from above the punishment came upon them from where they did not expect then on the day of resurrection he will disgrace them  and say   where are my partners for whose sake you opposed my guidance   those given knowledge will say   this day humiliation and affliction will surely befall those who have been denying the truth  those whose lives the angels take while they are wronging their own souls will offer submission saying   we were not doing anything evil    indeed   the angels will reply   god is aware of what you have been doing so enter the gates of hell there you shall abide forever   evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant when those who fear god are asked   what has your lord sent down   their reply is   goodness   the reward of those who do good works in this world is good  but the abode of the hereafter is even better the home of the righteous is indeed excellent they will enter gardens of eternity  where rivers will flow at their feet there they will have all that they wish for thus god rewards the righteous those whose lives the angels take in a state of purity  saying to them    peace be on you  enter the garden  because of the good which you did in the world  are they waiting for the angels to come to them  or the fulfillment of your lord s will those who went before them did the same god did not wrong them  rather they wronged themselves the evil results of their deeds overtook them  and that which they used to mock at encompassed them those who associate others with god say   if god had so willed we would not have worshipped anything besides him  neither we nor our fathers  nor would we have forbidden anything without his sanction   so did those who went before them the duty of the messengers is only to convey the message clearly we raised among every people a messenger who enjoined   worship god alone and shun the evil one   then among them were some whom god guided and among them were others who became deserving of ruin so travel across the earth and observe what was the end of those who rejected the messengers though you prophet may be eager to guide them  god does not guide those whom he lets go astray  because of their refusal to give a positive response to the truth they will have no supporters they swear their strongest oaths by god that god will never raise the dead to life    nonetheless  it is a promise truly binding on him  even though most people do not realize it   this is so that he may make clear to them what they have differed about and so that those who are bent on denying the truth may realize that they were lying when we will something to happen  all that we say is   be   and it is as for those who  after persecution  migrated from their homes for the cause of god  we will provide them with a goodly abode in this life  but truly the reward of the hereafter will be greater  if they only knew it they are the ones who are steadfast and put their trust in their lord before you also the messengers we sent were but mortal men to whom we vouchsafed revelation ask the people of the book  if you do not know  we sent them with clear signs and scriptures we have sent down the reminder to you  to enable you to make clear to mankind what has been sent down to them  so that they may reflect upon it do those who devise evil plans feel secure that god will not make them sink into the land  or that a punishment will not come upon them from where they least expect or that he will not seize them suddenly in their daily activities and they will not be able to frustrate him or that he will not punish them by giving them a fright indeed  your lord is kind and merciful have they not observed the things god has created  casting their shadows right and left  prostrating themselves before god in all humility everything in the heavens and all the creatures on the earth prostrate themselves before god  as do the angels  and they do not behave proudly they fear their lord above them  and do what they are commanded god says   do not take two gods he is only one god so fear me alone  to him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth  and obedience is due to him alone will you then fear anyone other than god whatever blessing you have is from god  and to him you turn for help when distress befalls you yet no sooner does he relieve your distress than some among you set up other partners besides their lord showing no gratitude for what we have given them enjoy yourselves awhile  but soon you will know
